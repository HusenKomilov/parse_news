            "content": "Celtic came from behind to beat Hibernian 3-1 as the champions extended their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership to 20 points. Martin Boyle gave the visitors the lead but Celtic turned the game around with two goals in four minutes just before the break from Nicolas Kühn and Adam Idah.Reo Hatate scored his 11th goal of the season in the second half as Celtic inflicted just a second defeat in 20 league matches on David Gray’s team, who remain three points above Aberdeen in the race for third place.Brendan Rodgers had flagged big changes to his team but the three alterations were all influenced by fitness issues. Kasper Schmeichel and Kuhn returned while Auston Trusty replaced the injured Cameron Carter-Vickers.Celtic dominated the early stages but Idah could not beat goalkeeper Jordan Smith when clean through and twice failed to connect with square balls from Daizen Maeda before he eventually netted.Schmeichel made an excellent stop from Boyle, although the Hibs attacker might have been offside, before being beaten by the same player in the 25th minute. Trusty failed to divert Josh Campbell’s shot to safety and Boyle stabbed home from nine yards.Arne Engels fired over and Hibs survived a VAR check for handball against Chris Cadden before Celtic turned the game on its head in the final four minutes of the half. Kühn rounded Smith to equalise after Rocky Bushiri had eased Idah off course for Anthony Ralston’s ball over the top, only to leave the coast clear for the German winger.Kühn soon turned provider as the Hibs defence failed to track Idah’s run and the Irishman slotted home from the through ball.Bushiri headed not far wide from a long throw early in the second half before Jack Iredale and Kühn were each handed a yellow card following an off-the-ball grapple.Celtic moved further ahead in the 58th minute after some excellent one-touch football in and around the box, ending with Hatate sweeping home from an Engels pass.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionIdah twice shot over from decent chances, although he was flagged offside from the second, and Schmeichel ensured there would be no nervy finish as he saved from Jordan Obita and substitute Junior Hoilett.Rodgers introduced 18-year-old midfielder Sean McArdle for a debut in the 85th minute and the young player showed some good touches and a willingness to get forward. Luke McCowan forced a decent late save from Smith as Celtic saw out the win.This story will be updated after Sunday’s game between Rangers and Aberdeen (noon BST)",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-immediate-us-mediated-ceasefire",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 17:26",
            "content": "India and Pakistan have agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its longevity was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced.The ceasefire – which was hoped to end days of escalating clashes between the two nuclear-armed countries – was first declared by the US president, Donald Trump, on Saturday afternoon, after 48 hours of diplomacy between India and Pakistan, apparently brokered by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and vice-president, JD Vance.Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”The ceasefire was later confirmed in a post on X by the Pakistani deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, who said the ceasefire would come in “with immediate effect”.The Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said the heads of military operations from both countries had spoken on Saturday afternoon.“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.” The top military officials would speak again on 12 May, Misri added.However, the agreement was thrown into question after cross-border shelling restarted between the Indian and Pakistan armies on Saturday night. Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, was also rocked by heavy explosions and projectiles that soared through the sky from over the border.An Indian government source told AFP that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire. A senior Pakistani security source said it was India that had started the ceasefire violations.Rubio said the ceasefire agreement had come after extensive negotiations by him and Vance with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials.“I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X.“We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,” he added.News of the ceasefire was greeted with celebrations across India and Pakistan, particularly in Kashmir, the disputed region divided between the two countries that had been at the forefront of hostilities, with dozens killed in shelling over the border – known as the Line of Control (LoC) – in the past week.In Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of jubilation.“When news of the ceasefire broke, displaced families in camps began dancing with joy,” he said. “This is a great step towards peace and the welfare of the people. As a resident of a frontier area, I cannot put into words what this announcement means for us. Now everyone is preparing to return home.”But Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, a border town in Indian-administered Kashmir where many were killed and injured in this week’s violence along the LoC, said the news of the ceasefire was bittersweet. His home was destroyed in cross-border shelling and two of his relatives were killed.“We’ve been here before – temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers. But until India and Pakistan seriously settle their disputes, we must brace for even greater conflicts,” he said.However, those who gathered in the streets to celebrate were then driven indoors as explosions began to boom out over parts of Indian-Kashmir on Saturday night.Historically, the US has played an important role as a mediator between India and Pakistan when hostilities have flared up. However the Trump administration’s proactive role in brokering peace was a notable reversal of Vance’s position 48 hours earlier, when he said the US would not intervene in the India-Pakistan conflict as it was “none of our business”.The ceasefire appeared to give both sides the opportunity to walk away claiming victory. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.In Pakistan it was met with a chorus of approval. “Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, professionalism and national resolve unequivocally intact,” said Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman.The ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against major military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into all-out war. India and Pakistan have fought four wars, most recently in 1999.The fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes on Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.By Saturday morning, India had accused Pakistan of launching strikes on dozens of airbases and military headquarters across north India, using long-range weapons, drones and fighter aircraft. The accusations came a few hours after Pakistan said India had fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting three of Pakistan’s most important military bases early on Saturday morning. Both accused the other of firing cross-border missiles first.At a press conference, Indian army spokesperson Col Sofiya Qureshi accused Pakistan of attacking 26 sites in India, including the Pathankot military airfield in Punjab, Srinagar airport and Udhampur air force base in Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as “deplorable and cowardly” attacks on civilian infrastructure.Qureshi said “Indian armed forces successfully neutralised these threats” but added that some damage was done to equipment and personnel at four airbases.The Indian army alleged its attack on Pakistan’s military bases on Saturday was in retaliation for high-speed missiles fired at several airbases in Punjab at about 2am. “In a swift and calibrated response, Indian armed forces carried out precision attacks only on identified military targets,” said Qureshi.Pakistan’s version of events was different to that of India. In an address broadcast on state TV at about 3.30am, the military spokesperson Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry claimed India had struck first, using fighter jets to fire surface-to-air missiles at Pakistan’s Nur Khan, Murid and Rafiqui military bases. He said the “majority” of India’s missiles were intercepted by air defence systems.Shortly after, Pakistan confirmed it had begun its counterattack against India, under the name Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, a phrase from the Qur’an roughly translating to “wall of lead”.In the hours after the missile attacks, both India and Pakistan said they were committed to de-escalation, if the other side agreed to stop their attacks.The US-brokered ceasefire ended concerns over a spiralling cycle of escalation and of a wider war, which had prompted international concern. Earlier on Saturday, the G7 had called for both countries to exercise “maximum constraint”.",

            "content": "Four Iranian men who were arrested on suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack in London can be detained and questioned in custody for another week, police said on Saturday.Five men were arrested last week, with armed police and in at least one instance special forces soldiers sent in to detain them, with reports suggesting the alleged target was the Israeli embassy in Kensington.The men arrested include a 29-year-old from Swindon in Wiltshire, a 46-year-old from west London, a 29-year-old from Stockport in Greater Manchester, a 40-year-old from Rochdale, and a 24-year-old from Manchester.The suspects, all Iranian nationals, were arrested on 3 May on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act, the Metropolitan police said.Four of the men, who were detained under the Terrorism Act, can be held until 17 May after warrants of further detention were granted on Saturday, the force added.The fifth suspect was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and was released on conditional bail to a date in May.The Israeli embassy in west London is understood to have been the target of the alleged plot, according to The Times and other press outlets, but police have declined to share further details.Cmdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “Our officers and staff continue to progress what is a significant and highly complex investigation.“We are working incredibly hard with public safety at the forefront of our ongoing efforts.“I would like to ask people to not speculate or share information that has not been confirmed by counter-terrorism policing.“We have clear and critical reasons for not providing further details at this time.“As soon as we can, we will look to share further information with the public.”Murphy said the Met is working closely with local police forces as searches are being carried out at a number of addresses in the Greater Manchester, London and Swindon areas.He added: “As always, I would ask the public to remain vigilant and if they see or hear anything that concerns them, then to contact us.”In a separate counter-terrorism investigation conducted by the Met, three Iranian men were arrested in north London last weekend under the National Security Act 2023.Another Iranian man suspected of “foreign power threat activity” was arrested in north London on Friday as part of the same investigation.",

            "content": "Pep Guardiola has an extremely fond memory of St Mary’s Stadium. It was here on the final day of the 2017-18 season that he watched Gabriel Jesus score a stoppage-time winner to ensure Manchester City finished as the Premier League champions with a record 100-point haul. It was a number at the opposite end of the spectrum that provided a prominent subplot this time.Southampton kicked off on 11 points, level with the lowest haul in the competition – that collected with apologies by Derby in 2007-08. Could Southampton, who had suffered so much, get something to lift them clear of the unwanted association?The chances had felt slim at kick-off time, particularly with Erling Haaland back in the City lineup after a six-week ankle injury lay-off. But the answer was a stirring yes. After a performance of discipline and burgeoning resilience, it was a scoreless draw and the ground was rocking.City may have had one eye on next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Crystal Palace. But they still wanted a win to pull them level on points with Arsenal in second place, albeit with an inferior goal difference before the Arsenal’s trip to Liverpool on Sunday. They wanted to win a fifth league game in a row for the first time this season.It did not happen, City dreadfully flat in the first half and stirring too late, the closest they came during a flurry towards the end a blast by the substitute Omar Marmoush that came back off the crossbar.It was a day when the battle lines were drawn at the very outset. Simon Rusk’s 5-4-1 system was designed to do exactly what it said on the tactics board while City gorged themselves on possession and territory. From the first whistle, they appeared determined to pass their opponents to death.The Southampton fans had turned up braced for something bad; mindful City had recovered some of the old certainties in recent weeks. But the first half simply drifted by, the tempo low in the sunshine, any intensity wholly absent. The City support amused themselves by running through their back catalogue, plenty taunting Manchester United.City worked their patterns, coming this way, then that. Repeat and repeat. It was hard to remember anyone in sky blue beating his man before the interval. Very little happened, apart from Kevin De Bruyne popping one free-kick over the crossbar and another into the wall.Lesley Ugochukwu, on a yellow card for a foul on Mateo Kovacic, diced with disaster when he stopped City from taking a quick free-kick just before half-time. He could have been sent off. Perhaps the referee, Tim Robinson, was lulled by the apathy. There have probably been duller halves this season. It was just difficult to say which ones.Guardiola introduced Jérémy Doku for James McAtee at the start of the second half and it was easy to imagine him reminding his players that they were mistaken if they thought they could just turn up and roll Southampton over. It is not the way in England’s top division.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionThere was more life after the break, the home fans incensed when Robinson penalised Tyler Dibling for a foul on Josko Gvardiol when it appeared that the Southampton winger had got past his marker. There would be a flare-up between Jan Bednarek and Haaland.Doku made a difference. It was his cut-back that offered Bernardo Silva a chance, Jack Stephens just about clearing the City player’s shot up and over his own crossbar. Doku nearly fed Haaland on a City counter. And it was a genuine counter because Southampton were able to make a few forays upfield.City turned the screw in the closing stages. The chances started to come. Manuel Akanji had a header pushed out by Aaron Ramsdale while Haaland put a square ball just behind the onrushing substitute, Nico O’Reilly. Another replacement, Savinho, could not get a Haaland header to sit down for him while Rúben Dias extended Ramsdale.Southampton put their bodies on the lines. Their fans increasingly lived on the end of their nerves. It felt as though City were lining up the decisive blow but when Marmoush shot against the crossbar at the beginning of stoppage time that would be that for them.In the sixth of the seven added on, yet another replacement, Cameron Archer, threatened the heist at the other end. Ederson had his angles covered but it did nothing to douse the Southampton celebrations.",

            "content": "Brentford’s pursuit of a first-ever European qualification gained strength as they beat Ipswich 1-0 at Portman Road to make it four Premier League wins in succession. Kevin Schade headed the game’s only goal from a corner in the 18th minute to give his side a lead they rarely looked like relinquishing. A late Ipswich rally, during which Omari Hutchinson hit a post and Mark Flekken produced an outstanding save to deny Cameron Burgess, proved in vain.The form of Thomas Frank’s side, together with favourable remaining fixtures as well as the defeat for Fulham at home to Everton, leaves the chance of an eighth-place finish and with it a possible spot in the Conference League tantalisingly within reach. The four-team tussle for eighth may yet go to the final day, by which time the number of European places via the league, which hinges on the outcome of the FA Cup final, will be known.Kieran McKenna’s side are left with one chance to add to their solitary home league win this season, and whatever inquest lies ahead into their relegation must surely begin with the fact they have netted only 13 times in front of their own fans.The winning goal came early and was the only highlight of a poor first half. Bryan Mbeumo’s near-post corner was met just inside the six-yard box by Schade, who rose and angled a brilliant looping header over his own shoulder and high beyond the reach of Dara O’Shea’s attempt to head clear.●  Brentford have won four consecutive games in the top flight of English football for the first time since February-March 1939 (5) and have amassed 16 wins overall from their 36 games this season (D7 L13), their joint-most at this stage of a top-flight season, alongside 1936-37 and 1937-38.●  Mark Flekken saved all four of Ipswich’s shots on target today; he has faced the most shots on target of any goalkeeper in the Premier League overall this season (192), however, just 26.6% of them have resulted in goals conceded, the best rate of any goalkeeper this term (minimum 30 shots on target faced).●  Bryan Mbeumo’s assist for Kevin Schade’s winner was his 25th goal involvement in the Premier League this season (18 goals, 7 assists), the most by a Brentford player in a single campaign in the competition, overtaking Ivan Toney’s 24 in 2022-23 (20 goals, 4 assists).●  Ipswich have lost each of their past eight Premier League games at Portman Road, their longest-ever home losing run in any division and have lost 13 home games in total this season, their joint-most in a single campaign (also 13 in 1994-95).Jack Taylor fired a shot wide from distance for Ipswich after good work on the left from Julio Enciso. It was the extent of the threat the home side made on Flekken’s goal in the first half. Brentford came within a yard of doubling their lead on the stroke of the interval, Mikkel Damsgaard dragging his first-time effort just beyond a post.McKenna will shortly have time to reflect on what positives there are to be drawn from his team’s disappointingly brief stay in the top flight. Chief amongst them surely will be the performances of the goalkeeper Alex Palmer, signed in January from West Brom, who has looked every bit at home in the division. He added to his highlights reel of impressive saves early in the second half, getting down low to turn away Yoane Wissa’s poked effort, then again to beat away Mbeumo’s attempt at his near post.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionIpswich came close to collecting just their eighth home point of the campaign late on. Hutchinson crashed a shot against the near post from a good position then Flekken produced stunning reflexes to turn away Burgess’s volley.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 17:14",
            "content": "It took a trip across the border and an opponent with other things on their mind but Bristol stopped the recent rot with a bonus-point victory that keeps their playoff hopes alive. Their performance did not quite live up to all the pyrotechnics that adorned their Big Day Out at the Principality Stadium but six tries and a win over a second-string Bath side was enough to satisfy their supporters.Indeed, 51,095 showed up to watch a West Country derby that was keenly fought if lacking in the highest quality. Bristol survived an early bout of stage fright and withstood a second-half comeback by their visitors to seal the win with late tries from Will Capon and Bill Mata. For Bath – who were already guaranteed top spot – it is a first defeat in 11 in all competitions but Johan van Graan will be pleased with how his callow charges acquitted themselves.The Premiership has plenty of its own problems but this trip to Cardiff brought into sharp relief those of their neighbours. Shortly before kick-off at the home of Welsh rugby, the Ospreys and the Scarlets released a statement defending why they have not yet joined Cardiff and the Dragons in signing up to the new professional agreement.Bristol have put their back into marketing this fixture – they have already booked to come back next year – but it is saying something that the Bears were able to attract a crowd not far off double that of Wales’s Judgement Day a few weeks ago. As if to hammer home the disparity, on Saturday the Premiership announced its long-term £200m renewed deal with TNT Sports. You suspect the broadcasters would have preferred Bath to have picked their first team, to have unleashed their two British & Irish Lions in Finn Russell and Will Stuart, but that is the league leaders’ prerogative and another reminder the Premiership is far from perfect.It is unlikely Pat Lam cares too much about that. Bristol’s corporate arm may hope that whoever they play next year will bring their A-listers but the Bears had lost their past three Premiership matches before this and desperately needed to arrest that slide to maintain hopes of reaching the playoffs. Bath, meanwhile, have a European Challenge Cup final at this stadium on 23 May before the Premiership playoffs and understandably made 13 changes from the side ttha defeated Edinburgh in the semi-final last Saturday.They began well enough, weathering an early Bristol storm to score the first try through the 22-year-old fly-half Ciaran Donoghue. There was an element of fortune – Donoghue’s kick was charged down but fell to Joe Cokanasiga who ran hard and straight before offloading to Bath’s No 10. Donoghue has caught the eye in recent weeks, emerging as a potential contender for England’s summer tour of Argentina and the USA, and he finished his try with an impressive turn of pace.Bristol had already been reduced to 14 men with Max Lahiff sent to the sin-bin during mounting Bath pressure and from kick-off it was soon 13 – Benhard Janse van Rensburg shown a yellow card for taking out the visiting captain, Ewan Richards, in the air. The Bears were finally on the board on 27 minutes, however, when Gabriel Ibitoye wriggled over from close range and soon after Janse van Rensburg’s return, he straightened and flung the ball to Rich Lane for try number two.Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionThe Bears had settled by this stage, Bath’s young charges were reeling and Bristol added another on the stroke of half-time – Gabriel Oghre finishing off at the back of a driving maul. Fitz Harding brought up the bonus point five minutes into the second half but Bath stirred themselves. The excellent Richards got on the scoresheet with a lovely dummy and a nervousness befell Bristol when Joe Batley and Mata were sent to the sin-bin in quick succession.As it was, Bath’s greenhorns could not quite take advantage and late breakaway scores from Capon and Mata put the gloss on Bristol’s victory.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 17:11",
            "content": "Brighton are a club built on statistics, from owner Tony Bloom’s gambling to the global recruitment and even the permutations that could still see them qualify for Europe. Defeating Wolves allowed for more simple equations being the answer, as Danny Welbeck reached 10 goals in a season for the first time in his almost 17-year career before Brajan Gruda opened his Seagulls account.At 34, Welbeck has found his best form and showed the confidence to score from the spot after Matheus Cunha gifted Brighton a penalty.In a Brighton team made up of players from across the world, possessing the fluidity and versatility required to change positions at a second’s notice, the lad from Longsight can still be relied upon to do the basics right as a relentless centre-forward.Wolves started the more promisingly but did not possess a reliable striker. With Jørgen Strand Larsen deemed only fit enough for the bench, Vítor Pereira gave Gonçalo Guedes a chance down the middle. Unfortunately, the Portuguese winger is not a prolific scorer, the most recent of his five goals in 31 appearances this season coming in December. He had two fine early chances but failed to sort his feet out quickly on both occasions and failed to bother Bart Verbruggen.Brighton had earmarked Cunha as Wolves’ most dangerous player and tasked Mats Wieffer with being his shadow whenever the hosts had possession. Wherever the Brazilian wandered, the curly-haired Dutchman was never far behind him, making him completely ineffective.Despite the close attention of Wolves’ most talented man, Pereira’s side were on top in the early stages but without engaging the Brighton goalkeeper. Wolves were almost architects of their own downfall when José Sá pinged a clearance while 40 yards out from goal straight to Matt O’Riley, who should have taken a touch and shot towards the empty net from the halfway line but decided to pass and Yankuba Minteh failed to do anything with the chance.It was an enjoyable fixture with both sides intent on attacking. VAR, however, sucked the fun out of it when Welbeck turned in a Tariq Lamptey cross, wheeling away to celebrate double figures, or so he thought. The assistant’s flag very belatedly went out and then there was a tediously lengthy check to ascertain that Minteh was offside and in the goalkeeper’s eyeline, even though he failed to touch the ball.Brighton need not have worried because the man-marking duo Cunha and Wieffer went under the spotlight. The Brazilian took a poor touch facing his own goal, Wieffer nipped in and was then clumsily brought down by Cunha when through one-on-one inside the box. A booking for Cunha was the punishment and Welbeck added to it, reaching the historic milestone in the process.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionAs the hour mark approached, Pereira acted by making a quadruple change to liven things up and bring on Strand Larsen for Cunha to provide a much-need focal point in the final third. There was greater energy and zip for Wolves with their new foursome. Strand Larsen was planning a tap-in from a Rayan Aït-Nouri cross until Verbruggen threw out an arm to divert it away from the beanpole striker. They were further punished for their ineptitude in front of goal when Simon Adingra slipped in Gruda to dink home the second.The victory keeps Brighton in the hunt for Europe but they are reliant on finishing eighth, Newcastle and Manchester City securing European football via the league, and the latter also winning the FA Cup final. The odds are still against them but Brighton and Welbeck know how to embrace a statistical anomaly.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/10/lindsay-hoyle-house-of-commons-speaker-gifts-kept",
            "content": "Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, has kept almost 300 gifts over the last four years including dozens of bottles of alcohol, hampers, ties, cufflinks and chocolates, his declarations show.The speaker received a large volume of presents from foreign dignitaries such as ambassadors, MPs and sometimes companies and chose to keep hundreds of them rather than donating them to Speaker’s House – his residence and office – or parliament.The list, voluntarily declared by the speaker, includes about 80 bottles of alcohol, such as wine, champagne, whisky, rum and other spirits, since 2021.Other items retained by the speaker include 26 ties and cufflinks, skincare sets sent to him by Korean diplomats, books, drinking glasses, presents for his pets, a rug, pictures and decorative ornaments.At Christmas last year, he received hampers from Bahrain and Qatar, plus one from Anguilla containing champagne and two bottles of wine as well as foodstuffs. Priti Patel, the Conservative MP and shadow foreign secretary, has sent him a Christmas pudding at least three years in a row.On some occasions, the speaker passed on or shared free gifts with his office. When the North Macedonian ambassador gave him food and drink in November last year, he kept a bottle of Smidgin gin and and a bottle of wine and gave four herbal teas and three pots of Ajvar (a red pepper sauce) to his office.The register gives a glimpse of some of the free gifts offered to politicians, who are only required to declare those worth more than £300, while ministers must declare those worth more than £150.Tom Brake, the director of the Unlock Democracy campaign group and a former deputy leader of the House of Commons, said: “The speaker’s voluntary declaration of the gifts he receives shines a light on the potential scale of freebies accepted but undeclared by MPs.“The very generous £300 declaration threshold for MPs needs to be brought in line with the rules that commonly apply in the public and the private sector, where only nominal gifts can be accepted.”Keir Starmer, the prime minister, previously declared thousands of pounds worth of free clothing and pairs of glasses donated to him by the Labour donor Lord Alli. After a public furore, he and other senior cabinet ministers have said they will not accept freebies while in government.A spokesperson for the Speaker’s Office said: “As is common practice across the world, the speaker gives and receives gifts when hosting dignitaries as a token of friendship and relationship-building between nations and parliaments. All items are declared proactively – regardless of the £300 threshold applied by the MPs’ register of interests – to ensure transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest.“In consultation with parliamentary officials, a decision is made as to whether a gift would make a meaningful addition to the Speaker’s House historic collection, and if it should go on display. If the item does not meet those criteria, for example perishable goods, it is either retained personally by the speaker or his office.“As part of his welcome to visiting dignitaries and to cement friendships, many of the gifted ties and cufflinks are worn by the speaker – and decorative heritage items relating to that country are put on display.”Hoyle has recently defended himself in relation to spending on oversees trips that amounts to about £250,000 since 2019 on 19 foreign trips.Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionThe figure includes more than £180,000 on first- and business-class flights, while his stays included hotels in luxury resorts and dining in high-end restaurants.In his first interview since the revelations, Hoyle told the Sunday Times last month that it was his duty to represent the House at home and abroad.“People see the prime minister going off to the G20 and G7 but, of course, there’s the speaker’s equivalent of that in the same way that the secretaries of state also have their international conferences,” he said.“Now, there’s two ways we could do it. Leave an empty chair without the UK attending. What does that say about the UK’s standing in the world — especially with global events at the moment? But also it’s about using my power and influence in that sense to speak out, because it is about speaking truth to power to the Chinese and to Russia.“For example, when I go to these conferences, it’s about standing up and leading the rest of the room to tell Russia it had no right to invade the sovereign territory of Ukraine and [that it has] no right to continue that war.”Hoyle is paid about £160,000 a year and has use of a grace and favour flat in Speaker’s House within the Palace of Westminster.",

            "content": "Recovery operations to raise the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch’s superyacht Bayesian from the seabed off Sicily have been suspended after a diver died during underwater work.Rob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver, died on Friday while doing preparation work to cut the ship’s mainmast. He was employed by the maritime company Hebo, whose barge arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo. The luxury vessel was anchored just off Porticello when it was struck shortly before dawn by a violent storm on 19 August 2024. It sank within seconds, killing seven people, including Lynch and his daughter Hannah.Police said the cause of the diver’s death was unknown and an investigation was launched.“This pause in activity is necessary for the investigations to be completed and to allow all salvage and associated teams to mourn the tragic loss of a highly respected salvage diver during yesterday’s underwater work,” read a statement from the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of salvage specialists undertaking the project.A preliminary examination of the diver’s body revealed no visible injuries or burns. Investigators believe he may have suffered a medical problem while submerged.An alternative line of inquiry is that after divers used a blowtorch to cut the vessel’s boom, Huijben was struck by dislodged debris – possibly a piece of metal. Footage captured by underwater cameras cut off shortly before the incident.Marcus Cave, head of naval architecture and a director of TMC Marine, said Friday’s tragedy “has been felt by all involved in this project, and the priority right now is the family of this expert, specialist diver, who was well liked and indeed loved by all involved in the project. This pause in operations will enable thorough investigations to be completed into this tragic accident. It will also help us to mourn and regroup.“Our thoughts are with everyone affected. Salvage operations at sea always carry an element of risk,” he added. “The salvage team is providing full cooperation to the authorities in their investigations.”A further project update will be issued after the weekend.Investigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues: whether a series of human errors led to the sinking, as initially suspected, or if other factors were at play. Once it is ashore, an examination will determine if one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised.Lynch, who in June last year was cleared of fraud charges in the US relating to the sale of his company, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard in 2011, was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicily to celebrate his acquittal alongside 18-year-old Hannah and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian.Sign up to Headlines EuropeA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayafter newsletter promotionAmong those on board were Lynch’s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley International’s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died.Fifteen people survived, including Bacares.The wreck sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities.Insurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (£23m), a bill the Bayesian’s underwriters will pick up.",

            "content": "Josh Tarling of Ineos Grenadiers set a time-trial pace even the race favourite, Primoz Roglic, could not match to win stage two of the Giro d’Italia by one second in Albania.Tarling had a nervous wait before his first Grand Tour stage victory was confirmed as the 21-year-old Welshman watched Roglic come so close, but the Slovene had to settle for second place with the consolation of taking over the leader’s pink jersey for Red Bull–Bora–Hansgrohe.Jay Vine of UAE Team Emirates came third, the Australian finishing three seconds behind Tarling in the short 13.7km individual time-trial in Tirana. “To win today is definitely exceptional,” Tarling said. Racing only his second Grand Tour having failed to finish last year’s Vuelta A Espana, Tarling became the youngest rider to win a Giro time-trial.Vine crashed on Friday’s opening stage, but took the lead from Italian Edoardo Affini, before Tarling showed his time-trial prowess. Tarling came third in the 2023 world road time-trial and, racing his first Giro, had to sit and watch as the main contenders attempted to steal the win.“Waiting for the other riders to complete the course was hard too, I don’t want to do it again,” Tarling said. “It was long. I was afraid of everyone among the favourites.”All eyes were on the 2023 winner Roglic, and with the reigning champion, Tadej Pogacar, deciding to focus on the Tour de France, the 35-year-old Slovenian is expected to become the oldest Giro winner. Roglic, however, fell short, and Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) was well off the pace early in his ride. Van Aert beat Tarling to the bronze medal at last year’s Olympic Games.Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), who won the opening stage on Friday, was last to go and despite pushing hard to the end, the Dane finished 12 seconds down in seventh place and lost the overall lead to Roglic by one second. Sunday’s stage three is the last time the riders will tackle the Albanian roads in this year’s Giro, with a 160km ride that starts and finishes in Vlore.Friday’s opening was marred by Mikel Landa’s crash late on is stage one and it has now emerged the Basque and Geoffrey Bouchard suffered broken backs in the incident. Landa fractured a vertebra in his lower back, his Soudal-QuickStep team said, while on Saturday morning Decathlon revealed that Bouchard, who also was also forced to quit the Giro after the spill, had fractured both his collarbone and multiple fractures in his back.",

            "content": "Hull KR booked their place in next month’s Challenge Cup final courtesy of a comfortable victory over Catalans Dragons to once again move to within one game of a first trophy in 40 years. Rovers have been waiting since 1985 to lift a piece of silverware but have fallen agonisingly short twice in recent seasons, losing the 2023 cup final and last year’s Super League Grand Final. However, they are undoubtedly now one of the sport’s leading sides, underlined by this victory.Few could argue they did not deserve their place at Wembley. Inspired by the reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, yet again, Rovers had far too much for a Catalans side that could have little complaint about the outcome.Catalans trailed by four points after a compelling opening 40 minutes and even led at one stage when tries from Reimis Smith and Luke Keary made it 12-10 in their favour. But Rovers, who had scored twice through James Batchelor, then went ahead when Lewis finished a wonderful team move.He would convert and then add a penalty shortly after the restart to make it 18-12. But even at that early stage, Catalans appeared to be struggling in the heat and how Hull KR made them pay.The Dragons offered little to suggest there could be any sort of comeback and when Jack Broadbent cut through with 20 minutes to go to open up a 12-point lead, the semi-final felt a long way towards being decided. That was then emphasised when Broadbent scored his second after a fine break from Joe Burgess.With six minutes remaining, Burgess put the seal on another landmark day for the Robins as he scored their sixth.",

            "content": "Just over 26 years ago, thousands of Pakistani soldiers quietly made their way on to high, rocky ridges on the Indian side of the de facto border that divides the former princely state of Kashmir. The war that this rash operation triggered lasted much of the summer of 1999.Reporting on the conflict was a bizarre experience. In high mountain valleys, at altitudes more suited to mountaineers than soldiers, howitzers hurled massive shells across icy, rocky peaks and infantry readied for bayonet assaults. A Pakistani artillery officer read memoirs of English cricket stars and the Qur’an in his bunker. As spent shrapnel and rock splinters thrown up by incoming Indian shells rattled against the walls of the canvas mess tent, his commander spoke of Pakistan’s “historic national and religious duty” to free Kashmir, partitioned 50 years before, and waited for servants to bring dessert.The war of 1999 was the fourth between Pakistan and India and the third to have been triggered by Kashmir. If, over the decades, technology and regional politics have evolved dramatically, recent days have made clear that the animosity generated by the dispute over the region, said to be the most beautiful in south Asia, has not. Even if the ceasefire agreed on Saturday has silenced the guns for now, there is little doubt that they will speak again.For Pakistan, Kashmir’s Muslim majority means the region’s division is not just a historic injustice but an injury to the country’s original founding purpose as a home for the subcontinent’s Muslims. Just after the news of the ceasefire broke, Ishaq Dar, Pakistan’s foreign minister, posted on X that “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region” but carefully stressed that it had done so “without compromising on its … territorial integrity!”Kashmir means much more to India than a stunning backdrop for Bollywood movies. Many Indians would see losing the region, with its powerful historical and cultural significance, as an amputation of a vital part of their vast and diverse nation. India’s first post-independence leaders, secular and often left-leaning, made a point of fighting for Kashmir. The last weeks have shown that the country’s current leaders, rightwing religious nationalists, will do so too.If this ceasefire holds, then coming weeks will see a new battle: of narratives.India has claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba, the extremist group that carried out the massacre three weeks ago of 25 tourists and a guide in Indian-controlled Kashmir that started the conflict, is merely a proxy for Islamabad. Pakistan has denied this. Maintaining a state of conflict in Kashmir, undermining Delhi’s control there and internationalising the conflict have been strategic goals of Pakistan’s hugely powerful military for decades. Islamic militant groups, some based in Kashmir, others recruited and based elsewhere, have been a key tool to achieve this. That no one in Pakistan’s security establishment had any prior idea of April’s attack seems implausible.Pakistani officials seek to highlight underlying causes of violence: ongoing repression in Kashmir, the revocation by Delhi of the region’s autonomous status in 2019 and multiple other grievances.Back in 1999, like now, rhetoric from leaders in Delhi and Islamabad was sufficiently heated to prompt genuine international worries about an all-out war between the two nuclear-armed powers. Then, again like now, the sheer horror of what that might entail, even if the conflict remained conventional, sobered decision-makers on both sides.Twenty years ago, a combination of Indian military success and US pressure brought about a shaky peace that survived a round of skirmishes a decade later until being broken again.In this new confrontation too, Washington’s influence appears to have been key in bringing about de-escalation. This will not please Russia and China, both manoeuvring for greater influence in the region, even if the reported involvement of Turkey and Saudi Arabia is a useful reminder that the unipolar days of the late 1990s are long gone.Casualties this time around have been mercifully low, and economic damage limited. The latter rather than the former may have weighed most heavily in the decision to call a halt to hostilities. Neither nation can afford the kind of destruction and disruption that moving to the next level of war might have entailed. There are ties that bind, as well as much that divides. Observers noted that though Delhi effectively suspended a crucial treaty governing water access, it was not definitively broken.As in previous conflicts, that of 1999 included, leaders in both India and Pakistan have stepped back from the brink, showing what Trump described in his inimitable way on Saturday as “Common Sense and Great Intelligence”. All know how much they have to lose.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/10/leyton-orient-stockport-league-one-playoff-match-report",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 16:23",
            "content": "The Stockport manager Dave Challinor attacked “the worst decision I have seen in 15 years of management” after Leyton Orient salvaged a late draw in a pulsating and controversial League One playoff semi-final first leg at Brisbane Road.Charlie Kelman put the home side ahead on 30 minutes when he slotted home from six yards, with the officials failing to spot he was clearly in an offside position when the ball was flicked on by Omar Beckles. The video assistant referee system will be in use for the final at Wembley but has not been deployed in any of the semi-finals.Stockport turned it round after the break through a penalty by Ollie Norwood and a Fraser Horsfall header but Kelman struck from the penalty spot late on to leave the tie in the balance going into the second leg at Edgeley Park on Wednesday.Challinor said. “Massive kudos to our players for reacting in a positive way to a decision which was the worst I’ve seen in my 15 years of management in what was the biggest game of my managerial career.“I’ve not spoken to the referee or linesman as of yet but the processes are all completely wrong. That was an absolute shocker. When someone is four yards offside that’s really worrying. I can understand now why there is a scramble to get robots involved and stop human error because incidents like today cannot happen.“People are putting tens of millions of pounds into football and things can be dictated by a flag and a whistle and that’s not a good place to be.”Challinor’s opposite number, Richie Wellens, said he did not have a clear view but “people have told me it is offside – and if he is offside, just give it offside. We would rather get a genuine goal. I’ve said it all season that the referees have a huge impact on games at this level. I believe we should have had another penalty, too.”The visitors had created the better chances in a competitively-fought first period, testing Josh Keeley in the home goal on a number of occasions. Kyle Wootton found himself free in the fifth minute but Keeley raced out to narrow the angle and avert the danger while Will Collar should have done better with a cross when he headed wide.A powerful drive from Owen Moxon was punched clear by Keeley before Jayden Fevrier, a constant threat down the right, cut inside Brandon Cooper and unleashed a shot which Keeley saved with his feet. But it was Kelman, League One’s leading marksman, who opened the scoring on the half-hour mark, converting the flick from Beckles with ease.Orient were grateful to the crossbar for protecting their lead soon after the interval when a 25-yard thunderbolt by Moxon beat Keeley but Stockport were deservedly back on terms on 60 minutes. Fevrier sent a cross into the box and Rarmani Edmonds-Green handled the ball, although he was being held down by Horsfall. Norwood slammed the resultant penalty into the net. Stockport then took the lead, with Norwood’s free-kick headed in by Horsfall in the 65th minute.The Orient substitute Ollie O’Neill was involved in the leveller on 88 minutes when his shot was adjudged by Ben Speedie to have been handled by Horsfall and Kelman stepped up to send Corey Addai the wrong way. Orient might even have snatched an advantage deep in added time but Beckles volleyed over from four yards.“As a last game of the season at home I thought it was a great spectacle,” said Wellens. “It was something the supporters can be proud of, and the players too.”",

            "content": "New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr has decided to retire because of a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff injury in his right shoulder, the team announced Saturday.Carr, 34, has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft.He was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season.Carr, who was set to enter the third year of a four-year, $150m contract, has career passing totals of 41,245 yards, 257 touchdowns and 112 interceptions.He retires with a 77-92 record as a starter without ever having won a playoff game.Carr’s retirement comes after New Orleans used a high second-round draft choice to select Louisville’s Tyler Shough as a potential future starting quarterback – although it remains to be seen how quickly he can be ready for that role.Other QBs on the Saints’ roster include second-year pro Spencer Rattler and third-year player Jake Haener, who did post a victory between them in seven games last season, six of which Rattler started.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/channel-islands-conservation-oceans",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 16:00",
            "content": "Just 14 miles (23km) off the southern California coast lies a vast underwater paradise.Giant sea bass the size of grizzly bears and schools of sardines glide together through swirling strands of golden kelp, whose long stalks preside over a world exploding with life and color. Playful harbor seals dance into the depths of undulating pink, green and orange plants, alongside spiny crustaceans and vibrant sea stars that embrace the volcanic rock that slopes to the sandy seafloor.Often called California’s Galapagos, the immersed cliffsides and caves of the Channel Islands are home to thousands of species that thrive on the rugged, pristine and isolated federal parklands and the state-protected waters that surround them.A lure for research and recreation alike, the 13 designated marine protected areas (MPAs) around the island preserve roughly 21% of their waters as refuge for the species that live there. While the public can access these areas near the cities of Santa Barbara and Ventura to swim, surf and dive, fishing and other activities that could result in harm or habitat loss are prohibited.But some safeguards for this sanctuary are being questioned.This year, the California fish and game commission is conducting a required review of these MPAs and considering an array of proposals to either expand or reduce protections around the islands.The marine protected area network, which now covers 124 coastal sections and spans roughly 16% of state waters, was designated with clear goals in mind and with significant buy-in from the public.With the MPAs’ first 10-year review under way, California officials are evaluating whether they have been successful at sustaining marine life and ecosystems, maintaining educational, recreational and spiritual use and minimizing economic loss. Twenty petitions have been filed by stakeholders – tribes, fisheries and recreators among them – and are being taken into consideration. Decisions are expected early next year.Scientists, conservationists and environmental advocates hope the abundance that has flourished here proves the value of preservation.“We have had two decades of opportunity to learn from the lab of protected areas at the Channel Islands,” said Dr Douglas McCauley, associate professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara and director of the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory. He called the area “an economic tool”.With fewer than 290,000 visits to the Channel Islands in 2024, the park is far less trafficked than other loved-to-death outdoor attractions in California (by comparison, Yosemite hosted more than 4.3 million visits last year). But the five remote islands, reachable only by boat, offer a rare glimpse into a wilder world. There are no paved roads, no rental shops and no gift shops, and many of the buildings are of historical and cultural relevance rather than being for visitor use.It’s this untouched experience that lures adventure-seekers across the channel and into the surf, where the rich biodiversity cultivated by conservation is the primary draw – especially beneath the waves.“People come from around the state and around the world to dive the Channel Islands, drawn by playful sea lions, underwater cathedrals of emerald kelp forests and giant sea bass weighing four times more than the divers themselves,” said Molly Morse, senior manager at Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory, speaking about a 2023 study she did that showed MPAs drive ecotourism dives.But the benefits spread beyond drawing hardy tourists, according to McCauley. Barring fishing in specific spaces has not only helped species bounce back – it has also been a boon for the fishing industry.Speaking over the loud hum of a dive boat engine as it churned through the expanse of blue toward the islands, McCauley likened the regulations to a savings account that generates exponentially higher returns. “When you leave some of this biodiversity without harvesting it, it grows in number but it also grows in size,” he said. Allowing creatures to grow larger means they will produce more eggs and fuel a bounty of biodiversity that spills over into areas where fisheries, recreation and ecosystem recovery can all benefit.“A very large sheephead,” he said, referring to a uniquely featured fish with a pink middle and large, protruding teeth, “that maybe has the mass of two smaller females, produces far more than just twice the number of eggs.”Even on the surface on a cold, grey day in May, the area bounds with life. As the coastal communities on the mainland fade against the horizon, scores of dolphins spring through the surf under a cacophony of hungry gulls. A humpback flashes its sides and tail before emerging face-first to gulp its lunch.But it’s more than just observed abundance. The extensively studied areas have proven able to feed and fuel nearby fisheries. Lobster production alone increased by 225% outside of its boundaries, according to McCauley. Meanwhile, biomass increased by 80% and a study of fish species documented a 50% jump within protected zones in just five years after the MPA designation.Still, expanding the protections could prove challenging. Commercial fishers are largely supportive of ensuring ecosystems are sustainable but less keen on seeing their rights to more marine areas revoked.Craig Shuman, marine region manager at the California department of fish and wildlife, told the Associated Press that the marine protected areas are among the most controversial things the agency works on. Last year, a range of stakeholders, which included fisheries, tribes, conservationists and recreators submitted 20 petitions with a range of suggestions, from decreasing or eliminating MPAs to enhancing and improving them. The petitions are under consideration by the commission.The political tides are also turning and conservation objectives are increasingly on the chopping block. The Trump administration has rolled back regulations on roughly 500,000 sq miles (1.3m sq km) of federal waters, opening once-protected areas to commercial fishing. The president has promised that more actions are on the way.Meanwhile, the threats continue. The climate crisis has added new challenges with dangers from disasters including fire-debris run-off, increased pollution and the changes caused by a warming world.“When we protect the ocean, we are really taking care of ourselves,” said Sandy Aylesworth, director of the Pacific Initiative at the Natural Resources Defense Council. She is hopeful that the MPAs will not only be reinforced but expanded: among the proposals are five new MPAs and eight expansions, including four that would make current regulations even more restrictive.“There are also proposals that would weaken the network,” she said, noting the strong headwinds conservation proposals face locally and across the country. With initial recommendations from the department of fish and wildlife not expected until November, there’s not a strong signal which way things will go.Until then, the research will continue, as will fishing along the spillover zones where species are bountiful. Divers will swim among the rare and vibrant creatures in the depths. Birds will watch them from perches atop the craggy rocks.For McCauley, that’s already a tremendous achievement. But he thinks there’s more to do.“This amazing park is still a baby park,” he said, comparing the 20-year-old Channel Islands national park to the 152-year-old Yellowstone.“This is just a glimpse,” he said. “Imagine what these values can be if maximized for several generations – for another century of Californians. That is what I would love to challenge ourselves for today.”",

            "content": "Military leaders and commanders at the Pentagon were ordered on Friday to go through their libraries and review all books that are related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the US military’s latest anti-DEI move.Leaders were ordered to “promptly identify” materials that promote “divisive concepts and gender ideology [that] are incompatible with the department’s core mission”, according to a memo sent to leaders that was seen by the Associated Press. The department gave leaders until 21 May to remove the books.Also on Friday, the Pentagon sent a separate memo to the military’s training academies that the institutions should have “no consideration of race, ethnicity or sex” in their admission process and should focus “exclusively on merit”, though they can allow for students who show “unique athletic talent”, according to the AP. The department ordered the administrations to certify these standards by mid-June.Sign up to This Week in TrumplandA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationafter newsletter promotionThe memo to leaders on books follows a similar order that was given to the military academies, including the US Naval Academy, which removed nearly 400 books from its library. Books that were withdrawn from the library included Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, novels by writers of color including the Palestinian American Etaf Rum, and academic books that examine race and gender.The department said that a temporary “academic libraries committee” will convene to help the other colleges and academies remove similar books from their collections. Librarians and staff were ordered to use search terms like “affirmative action”, “anti-racism”, “critical race theory” and “white privilege” when determining which books could be subject for removal.The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has vowed to purge DEI from the Pentagon, saying when he took office earlier this year that “our diversity is our strength” is “the single dumbest phrase in military history”.Since January, the Trump administration has been overseeing a widespread culling of anything the White House considers to be DEI within the federal government. The specific number of DEI roles that have been removed is unclear as the federal government isn’t keeping track or reporting which roles have been eliminated, but estimates say hundreds or possibly thousands of employees have been fired since the start of the year.",

            "content": "“I’ve had so many coffees, I feel hysterical,” says Billie Piper. The 42-year-old actor has set up camp in a caff in Camden, London, while she finishes the final draft of a romcom she’s working on – a follow-up to her 2021 directorial debut, Rare Beasts. Piper shot to fame at 15 as a pop star, then transitioned into acting, becoming a household name as Rose Tyler in Doctor Who. Since then, she’s carved out a niche playing women at breaking point (like Suzie Pickles in I Hate Suzie). Now, she’s ready to do less acting and more work behind the scenes. Not that her on-screen career is slowing down – she just bagged her fifth Bafta nomination, for playing journalist Sam McAlister in Scoop, the dramatisation of the BBC Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew about Jeffrey Epstein. She will also appear in the Netflix mega-hit and Addams family spin-off, Wednesday, later this year.You’re an expert at playing a woman on the edge. What’s the secret?\n I’ve seen it a lot, I’ve been it, and I’m not afraid of it! You can be a woman on the edge, but also be a soulful woman, a playful woman and a funny woman. You can be all those things at once.What drew you to Scoop?\n That interview was one of the most shocking things I’ve seen on TV. I’d followed the Epstein story very closely, with huge rage – the size, the scale, the privilege and the bullshitting, it’s just too disturbing. So there was a bit of an axe to grind. Then, on top of that, I met Sam, and she’s a truly formidable woman.You’ve said one of your aims with your work is to ‘lift the lid on what it means and what it costs to be female’. Do you think that cost is increasing or decreasing?\n Increasing. It feels like, in many ways, we’re going backwards. I wonder if there is a greater hostility from guys towards girls. There’s certainly a world available to men that violently rejects feminism or emancipation. It’s really frightening. Now that I’ve had a daughter, I can see violence against women more clearly. It’s like I couldn’t see it for myself, which is alarming, and I’ve had to do work reframing a lot that I’d normalised in my life. It’s a fine balance: how do we keep women safe while also nurturing boys, who are facing issues, too?How do you deal with conversations about toxic masculinity with your kids?\n Look, I haven’t got this down pat, but with my daughter and sons with whatever they’re facing, it’s about listening, holding your nerve when they say something that feels not quite right, and understanding they have to make mistakes. I can’t believe the pressures on them to have these political views all the time. There’s such expectation for young people to get it right immediately. And if they don’t, they’re written off. When I was their age, I was just, I don’t know, smoking cigarettes!Secret Diary of a Call Girl – the series you and Lucy Prebble made about sex worker Belle de Jour – went up on Netflix last year, 17 years after it first aired, and shot into the UK top three most viewed. How do you feel about people watching it again?\n I don’t know! It got so critically panned when it came out, and I was not that deep into my acting career, so I just thought: “Well, everyone says it’s shit, so maybe it is.” I think the fallout critically, even though it was a numbers success, made me feel very vulnerable. It being on TV again can’t be easy for my kids, because there’s a lot of sex. It makes me feel a bit anxious. Now I have a family, it’s not as simple as: “Oh, you just do a part, and everyone has to accept it’s a bit of acting.” Rightly or wrongly, it has repercussions.Do you two have plans for an I Hate Suzie season 3?I would love to do it again, but I think that I think she needs a bit more story in her. So I think the story would be served better from a bit more age, maybe menopause, a few more years off camera.Does the idea of being a role model sit heavily with you?I don’t like it. I’ve never liked it. It feels too frightening, and it doesn’t allow a lot of room for error. And I really struggled with that when I was a teenager, as a singer, I just hated that feeling. That’s been a bit of a hangover for me.You recently played Cassandra in Kaos. Fans were gutted when it was cancelled after season one. Do you think TV has become more ruthless in terms of what gets cut? Do you feel the pressure of that as an actor?\n  I don’t feel as if I’m aware of that pressure, but there must be something speaking to me, because I don’t just want to be an actor for hire any more. It feels too frightening. But then, you know, what am I going into? Writing things that also may never get made? People want to make massive things for loads of money, and then the expectation is that those numbers reflect that spend, and if they don’t then they’re gone. It’s really sad.Tell us about the romcom you are working on.If I watch 1990s romcoms now, I find them hard to understand. They just sit differently. Even though I love those movies, it’s a time that felt so radically different from the world we live in now. So I’m trying to do something that feels authentic to now, but still feels dreamy and hopeful.How do you cope with writer’s block?\n I panic! Luckily, I’m so green even the bad days seem achievable.What have you watched this year?\n  I’m such a snob around films, but with TV I’m completely different. I really love reality TV, Kardashians and the mindless stuff. I only just started watching Colin from Accounts.

            "content": "It was more nervy than it needed to be but Arsenal secured a second-place finish ahead of Manchester United with the win in a seven-goal thriller. A point would have been enough for the home team to earn a place in the third round of qualifying for next season’s Champions League, but a three-goal advantage with 20 minutes remaining was reduced to one in the space of six minutes to keep the jeopardy alive and the atmosphere among the 46,603 tense to the finish.Manchester United’s captain, Maya Le Tissier, had said Champions League football was “all that matters” , but the visiting team fought with the intensity of a team keen to put in a strong performance before their FA Cup final showdown with the WSL champions Chelsea a week on Sunday.For Arsenal, this was a chance to turn things around before a second Champions League final after two heavy league defeats, to Aston Villa and Brighton, and they did so, their Emirates Stadium send-off in full swing at the final whistle. “I’m happy we showed a much better version of ourselves, said Renée Slegers, their manager.The attention before kick-off had been on the home team’s goalkeeper, with Daphne van Domselaar unavailable because of an ankle injury there were doubts about the reliability of backup Manuela Zinsberger. However, it would be Phallon Tullis-Joyce – who will share the WSL golden glove with Chelsea’s Hannah Hampton after the latter kept a clean sheet against Liverpool – who would make a clanger in the second minute to give their rivals the lead, failing to hold on to Alessia Russo’s ball in that allowed Chloe Kelly to pounce and fire into the empty net.The mettle of the under-fire Zinsberger would be tested soon after, the Austrian rising to tip Ella Toone’s goalbound strike from distance over the bar. It was a confidence-boosting save, but a minute later the visiting team had the equaliser, a whipped-in corner was headed back towards the near post where an unmarked Toone was on hand to nod in.Arsenal retook the lead quickly after the break, Grace Clinton tangling with Caitlin Foord in the box and Mariona Caldentey coolly converting the resulting penalty. Five minutes later and the Gunners had a two-goal advantage, Frida Maanum collecting the ball from Katie McCabe before curling it into the net at the far post from a tight angle.They should have had another penalty soon after, Celin Bizet almost pushing the ball away with the palm of her hand but the referee waved away the appeals. The home team need not have worried, they had the fourth just past the hour mark, Kelly working hard before playing the ball to Kim Little who turned and powered the ball past Tullis-Joyce.United reduced the deficit with 20 minutes remaining though, McCabe passing under pressure straight to Elizabeth Terland whose strike took a deflection off Steph Catley to wrongfoot Zinsberger. The pressure was heaped on soon after, the referee pointing to the spot after McCabe brought down Bizet and Le Tissier hammered it in.Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballafter newsletter promotionMarc Skinner said the revival showed United were more mentally tough this season. “If this was last season, we would have gone down to 6-1 ,” he said. “From that perspective, it was right for us to stay aggressive. It’s a game where you’ve got to try to win and we’re a different beast this year.”Up next is a final apiece, United in the FA Cup and Arsenal against Barcelona in the Champions League on 24 May in Lisbon. “The Chelsea game will be different, but it’s given me a lot of ideas,” said Skinner.Slegers said: “Barcelona is going to be a totally different game. They have a different style of play, so they will challenge us in different ways.”",

            "content": "Donald Trump retook the White House vowing to stage “the largest deportation operation in American history”. As previewed, the administration set about further militarizing the US-Mexico border and targeting people requesting asylum and refugees while conducting raids and deportations in undocumented communities, detaining and deporting immigrants and spreading fear.Critics are outraged, if not surprised. But few expected the new legal chapter that unfolded next: a multipronged crackdown on certain people seen as opponents of the US president’s ideological agenda. This extraordinary assault has come in the context of wider attacks on higher education, the courts and the constitution.Here are some of the most high-profile individual cases that have captured the world’s attention so far because of their extreme and legally dubious nature, mostly involving documented people targeted by the Trump administration in the course of its swift and unlawful power grab.In recent weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) teams suddenly began arresting and detaining foreign-born students and academics on visas or green cards. In most cases the government has cited their roles in pro-Palestinian campus protests over Israel’s war in Gaza following the 7 October 2023 attack. Claims that they “support Hamas” are invoked as justification for wanting to deport them, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Those taken include:Mahmoud KhalilA recent graduate student of Columbia University in New York, Mahmoud Khalil, 30, is a Palestinian green-card holder who was a leader during protests last year. He was arrested without due process in front of his pregnant wife and has been in a detention center in Louisiana since mid-March, denied release to attend the birth. He told an immigration judge that he and hundreds of other detainees were being denied rights the court itself had claimed to prioritize: “Due process and fundamental fairness.”The government is using obscure immigration law to make extraordinary claims in cases like Khalil’s that it can summarily detain and deport people for constitutionally protected free speech if they are deemed adverse to US foreign policy. A far-right group has claimed credit for flagging his and others’ names for scrutiny by the authorities.Rümeysa ÖztürkUS immigration officials grabbed the Tufts University PhD student near Boston and bustled her into an unmarked car, shown in onlooker video. Öztürk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national on a visa, had co-written a student newspaper op-ed criticizing Tufts’ response to Israel’s military assault on Gaza and Palestinians. She was rushed into detention in Louisiana in apparent defiance of a court order. Öztürk, 30, reported neglect and abuse there in “unsafe and inhumane conditions”. On 7 May, an appeals court granted a judge’s order that she be returned to New England for hearings but on 9 May the judge ordered her immediate release, citing deep constitutional concerns, and she was freed on bail.Mohsen MahdawiMahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and student at Columbia University, was apprehended by Ice in Colchester, Vermont, on 14 April, as first reported by the Intercept.He was prominent in the protests at Columbia last year. He was arrested during an interview for US citizenship, which he now views as “a trap”. The administration’s arcane justification was that his activism could “potentially undermine” the Middle East peace process, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). He was detained in Vermont and a judge blocked his transfer to Louisiana. Democratic lawmakers visited Khalil, Öztürk and Mahdawi but failed to secure their release. Then on 30 April the federal court in Vermont ordered his release, and upon being freed Mahdawi said: “This is a light of hope and faith in the justice system … we are witnessing the fight for justice in America.”Yunseo ChungAnother Columbia student, Chung, 21, sued the administration for trying to deport her, and has gone into hiding. She is a pro-Palestinian campaigner and was arrested by the New York police in March while protesting, as first reported by the New York Times. She said a government official told her lawyer they wanted to remove her from the country and her residency status was being revoked. Chung was born in South Korea and has been in the US since she was seven.Alireza DoroudiThe Democrats on campus group at the University of Alabama said of the arrest of Doroudi, 32, an Iranian studying mechanical engineering: “Donald Trump, Tom Homan [Trump’s “border czar”], and Ice have struck a cold, vicious dagger through the heart of UA’s international community.”He was taken to the same Louisiana federal detention center as Khalil, denied bond. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said he was a threat to national security, without providing details. Doroudi’s fiancee, Sama Bajgani, also an Iranian doctoral student at the university told local TV: “We endured a lot to come to a safe place, to just pursue a degree. And then this happened to us.”Badar Khan SuriMore than 370 alumni of Washington DC-based Georgetown University joined 65 current students there in signing on to a letter opposing immigration authorities’ detention of Dr Badar Khan Suri, a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU).The authorities revoked his student visa, alleging the Indian citizen’s father-in-law was an adviser to Hamas in the past – and claiming he was “deportable” because of pro-Palestinian social media posts. He was taken to Louisiana and then detention in Texas. A federal judge ordered in early May that his case be heard in Virginia.Kseniia PetrovaThe Harvard Medical School research scientist was stopped at Boston’s Logan airport by US authorities on her way back from France in February, over what appeared to be an irregularity in customs paperwork related to frog embryo samples. She was told her visa was being revoked and she was being deported to her native Russia.Petrova, 30, said she feared persecution for opposing the invasion of Ukraine and also ended up in overcrowded detention in Louisiana. Her colleagues say her expertise is “irreplaceable” and Petrova said foreign scientists “enrich” America.More than 1,400 international students from 200 US colleges had their “legal status changed” by the state department, in what the specialist publication Inside Higher Education called “an explosion of visa terminations”.Amid scant information and rising panic, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, lambasted protesters and campus activists as “lunatics”. Some were cited for pro-Palestinian views, others think they were targeted because of minor crimes or offenses, such as a speeding ticket. Some could find no explanation, many tried to lie low. Critics of the administration surmise students are intentionally being pressured to leave voluntarily. DHS terms this “self-deport”, a confused term for leaving the country before you can be removed or detained, increasingly without due process, after losing your immigration status. Then in the face of multiple court challenges, the administration in late April reversed course and restored legal statuses that had been rescinded en masse. The administration later revealed in court that names were scraped from a national crime database that includes cases with arrests but no charges, charges dropped and even missing persons. It also issued new guidelines, however, that appear to expand Ice’s power over students’ immigration status. Uncertainty prevails.The legal rollercoaster came too late for these cases:Felipe Zapata VelásquezThe family of the University of Florida student Felipe Zapata Velásquez, 27, said he was “undergoing a physical and emotional recovery process” in his native Colombia after police arrested him in Gainesville in March for traffic offenses and turned him over to Ice. He agreed to be deported, to avoid lengthy detention and legal battles. The Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost accused authorities of “kidnapping” Velásquez.Ranjani SrinivasanColumbia doctoral student and Indian citizen Ranjani Srinivasan had her visa revoked in early March and Ice came knocking at her university apartment in New York. She swiftly fled to Canada. DHS later trumpeted her departure, called her a “terrorist sympathizer” and published surveillance footage of her rushing through LaGuardia airport. Srinivasan described to the New York Times a “volatile and dangerous” atmosphere in the US. Her lawyer accused DHS of being “un-American” and punishing constitutionally protected free speech.Kilmar Ábrego GarcíaThe Salvadorian man was removed to El Salvador by mistake, which the Trump administration admitted. But it is essentially defying a US supreme court order to “facilitate” his return to his home and family in Maryland. Ábrego García was undocumented but had protected status against being deported to El Salvador. He was flown there anyway, without a hearing, to a brutal mega-prison, then later transferred to another facility. The administration accuses him of being a violent gangster and has abandoned him, infuriating a federal judge repeatedly and prompting warnings of a constitutional crisis.He has not been charged with any crimes but was swept up with hundreds of Venezuelans deported there. He has begged to speak to his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who insists he is not a criminal. The sheet metalworkers union chief, Michael Coleman, described Ábrego García as an “apprentice working hard to pursue the American dream” and said he was not a gang member. Trump said he was eyeing Salvadorian prisons for US citizens.The US deported more than 230 Venezuelan men to the mega-prison in El Salvador without so much as a hearing in mid-March despite an infuriated federal judge trying to halt the flights, then blocking others. Donald Trump took extraordinary action to avoid due process by invoking the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA), a law meant only to be used in wartime, prompting court challenges led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). John Roberts, the US chief justice, rebuked the president when he threatened the judge. The justices, by a majority, did not stop Trump from using the AEA but the bench unanimously reaffirmed the right to due process and said individuals must be able to bring habeas corpus challenges.Most of the men are reportedly not violent criminals or members of violent gangs, as the Trump administration asserts, according to a New York Times investigation.Many appear to have been accused of being members of the transnational Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua partly on the basis of their tattoos, with their families speaking out, including:Andry José Hernández RomeroHernández, a 31-year-old makeup artist and hairdresser, entered California last year to attend an asylum appointment, telling the authorities he was under threat in Venezuela as a gay man. But he was detained and accused of being in Tren de Aragua because of his tattoos, then suddenly deported under Trump, deemed a “security threat”.Sign up to Fighting BackBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency. From our opinion desk.after newsletter promotionJerce Reyes BarriosThe former professional footballer, 36, has been accused of gang membership by the DHS, seemingly because of his tattoos, including one of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball with a rosary and the word “dios”.“He chose this tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favourite soccer team, Real Madrid,” his lawyer, Linette Tobin, said, adding that her client fled Venezuela after protesting against the government and being tortured.Francisco Javier García CasiqueRelatives were shocked when they spotted Francisco Javier García Casique, 24, in a propaganda video from El Salvador showing scores of Venezuelan prisoners being frog-marched off planes and into custody there. He is a barber in his home town of Maracay and is completely innocent of gang involvement, the family said, adding that Francisco and his brother Sebastián have matching tattoos quoting the Bible.A US military plane took off from California in February carrying more than 100 immigrants from countries as far flung as Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Pakistan, dumping them in Panama. They were shackled and deported to a third country without due process because their countries of origin refuse to accept them back from the US. Shocking scenes unfolded of the people locked in a hotel in Panama City, signaling and writing on the windows pleading for help.The people, including children, were then moved and held at a facility deep in the dense jungle that separates Panama from Colombia. They were later reportedly freed and were seeking asylum from other countries, their futures uncertain. One of those deported from the US was:Artemis GhasemzadehGhasemzadeh, 27, a migrant from Iran, wrote “Help us” in lipstick on a window of the hotel in Panama City, as a desperate way of alerting New York Times reporters on the street to her and fellow detainees’ plight. She had thought that, especially as a convert from Islam to Christianity who faces danger in Iran as a result, that she would be offered freedom in the US, she told the newspaper while still in custody. She is possibly still in Panama trying to get a foothold.Amir MakledMakled, a Detroit-born attorney, was questioned at the airport on returning from vacation. He was flagged to a terrorism response team, kept behind and pressured to hand over his phone, then give up some of its contents. The Lebanese American represents a pro-Palestinian student protester who was arrested at the University of Michigan. Experts said the incident was evidence of a weakening of fourth amendment constitutional protections at the border against “unreasonable search and seizure”.Nicole MicheroniThis Massachusetts immigration lawyer, a US-born American citizen, spoke out after receiving an email from the Trump administration telling her “it is time for you to leave the United States”. She said it was “probably, hopefully, sent to me in error. But it’s a little concerning these are going out to US citizens.” She told NBC she thought it was a scare tactic.Adam PeñaThis San Diego-based US citizen now carries his American passport and birth certificate everywhere with him and thinks he was sent one of the “time for you to leave” letters in error but because he represents clients in Ice detention locally. “I do believe this email was sent intentionally to immigration advocates around the country to instill fear and intimidation,” he told NBC news.Children who are seven, four and two and are US citizens were removed from the US in late April when their mothers were deported to Honduras. DHS said the two women chose to take their children with them but one of their lawyers told the Guardian that they were denied any opportunity to coordinate the care and custody of their children before being put on deportation flights from Louisiana. A federal judge said it was “illegal and unconstitutional” to thus remove a US citizen “with no meaningful process”.Jasmine Mooney, CanadaCanadian Jasmine Mooney was shackled and ended up in Ice detention in the US for two weeks over an alleged work visa irregularity while on one of her frequent visits to California. She spoke out about the harsh conditions and the information black hole and how outraged she was that so many other detainees she met, who helped her, are stranded without access to the kind of resources that ultimately got her out.Rebecca Burke, UKThe British graphic artist was stopped at the border when she headed from Seattle to Canada as a backpacker and, because of a visa mix-up, she became one of 32,809 people to be arrested by Ice during the first 50 days of Trump’s presidency. Almost three weeks of grueling detention conditions later, she smuggled out her poignant drawings of fellow detainees when she was released.Jessica Brösche, GermanyThe German tourist and tattoo artist, 29, from Berlin was detained by US immigration authorities and deported back to Germany after spending more than six weeks in US detention, including what she described as eight days in solitary confinement. Her family compared her ordeal to “a horror film”.Fabian Schmidt, GermanyThe 34-year-old German national and US green-card holder was apprehended and allegedly “violently interrogated” by US border officials as he was returning to New Hampshire from a trip to Luxembourg. His family said he was held for hours at Boston’s Logan airport, stripped naked and put in a cold shower, then later deprived of food and medicine, and collapsed. His case is being investigated and as of mid-April he was in Ice detention in Rhode Island.‘Jonathan’A man with a US work visa provided his anonymous account to the Guardian of being denied entry into the US after a trip to his native Australia to scatter his sister’s ashes. He was pulled aside on arrival in Houston, Texas, and accused, variously, of selling drugs and having improper paperwork. After being detained for over a day he was put on a flight back to Australia even though he has worked on the US east coast for five years, where he lived with his girlfriend.Alvin Gibbs, Marc Carrey and Stefan Häublein of band UK SubsMembers of the punk rock band UK Subs said they were denied entry and detained in the US on their way to play a gig in Los Angeles, after being questioned about visas. Bassist Alvin Gibbs said: “I can’t help but wonder whether my frequent, and less than flattering, public comments regarding their president [Trump] and his administration played a role.” He and the two band mates were kept in harsh conditions for 24 hours then deported back to the UK.French scientistA French scientist, who has not been publicly named, was denied entry to the US after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, according to a French government minister. The researcher was on his way to a conference in Texas.“Freedom of opinion, free research, and academic freedom are values ​​that we will continue to proudly uphold,” Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister of higher education and research, told Le Monde.",

            "content": "For the first time, we openly talked about what we liked and didn’t like, which really opened up our relationship for explorationMaeve and I are quite well matched in terms of libido. Sex isn’t on my mind all the time, it is something I have to foster and nurture. And that’s been the journey of the past few years.When we met almost 27 years ago, our sex life was exciting and adventurous. We’d do it outside, or sometimes in a swimming pool. It was spontaneous. But we didn’t actually talk about it much, so we didn’t really know what the other person liked. I grew up in a family where sex wasn’t talked about – which means I never had a relaxed attitude to it.As we approached 50, there was a period of five or six years when we only had sex once every few months. We were still a happy married couple, but it was a low point. The libido just wasn’t there – we would rather watch Netflix. I began to have problems keeping an erection when we did try to have sex, which was worrying. Luckily, Maeve was patient.I began thinking that I just wasn’t going to have sex in my life any more, which was really sad. So I told myself I had to take a closer look. I had been in therapy, and Maeve and I went to a couple’s counsellor and a sex therapist together. They gave us tools, such as giving each other massages and setting aside dedicated time together. Seeing a sex therapist, we realised we enjoy talking about sex and that it turns us on. For the first time we openly talked about what we like and don’t like, which really opened up our relationship to exploration.Initially, it was just practical things, such as “Do you like getting a blowjob?” It was a challenge for me to talk about it at first, but now we’re wide open. We write erotic stories for each other, which helps us communicate what we like. I have this funny thing about women in VW vans, for example, so I put that into my story.When I was younger, I thought that when you grow up and are in a long relationship, things would get boring. So it’s exciting to see that the older we get, the more we’re discovering about each other. We now have sex twice a week, which is a lot by our standards.If you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below. It is very important that both sexual partners are happy to participate.It was lonely, because if you don’t have sex for so long you lose a whole level of intimacyWhen I first saw Otto I could feel my heart going completely nuts. There was a very strong physical attraction. We’ve always been comfortable with each other sexually, and felt physically compatible, so the sex was very good.Sign up to Inside SaturdayThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We only had sex once in a blue moon, perhaps every three months. Sometimes, we would get intimate and Otto wouldn’t be able to keep an erection, and then I stopped initiating sex because I didn’t want to pressure him.It also didn’t help that I had gone through menopause and felt I had lost those horny feelings. It was lonely, because if you don’t have sex you lose a whole level of intimacy. It’s not only about the sex – you drift apart and just become two people living in the same house looking after the kids.Otto had been in therapy and we decided to see a sexual therapist together. I was nervous about sharing the most intimate part of my life, but if it’s worth fixing, you have to just cringe and get on with it. It turned out to be illuminating. As we opened up, some misunderstandings came to light. For example, I was under the impression Otto didn’t like performing oral sex on me and he thought I didn’t like him doing it to me.The therapist asked us if we’d ever talked to each other about our sexual fantasies. I wrote one of my fantasies in a Valentine’s card a decade ago, but never got a response. So Otto’s homework was to write one for me. That was a hit.We now write erotic stories for each other and then act out our fantasies. It has made everything a lot more exciting and spontaneous. And having sex makes you feel younger. It’s lovely, and I feel really close to Otto now.",

            "content": "Donald Trump’s administration must temporarily halt its sweeping government overhaul because Congress did not authorize it to carry out large-scale staffing cuts and the restructuring of agencies, a federal judge in California said on Friday.US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco sided with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments in blocking large-scale mass layoffs known as “reductions in force” for 14 days.“As history demonstrates, the president may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,” Illston said.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul that has been led by Elon Musk, the world’s richest person who is also the chief executive officer of electric vehicle maker Tesla.Dozens of lawsuits have challenged the work of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) on various grounds including violating privacy laws and exceeding its authority, with mixed results.Trump directed government agencies in February to work with Doge to identify targets for mass layoffs as part of the administration’s restructuring plans.The president urged agencies to eliminate duplicative roles, unnecessary management layers and non-critical jobs while automating routine tasks, closing regional field offices and reducing the use of outside contractors.“The Trump administration’s unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation,” said a statement from the coalition of plaintiffs.“Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government – laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that.”Illston scheduled a hearing for 22 May to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.She said that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on merits of some of their claims in their lawsuit, which was filed on 28 April and alleged Trump exceeded his authority. It also alleged the office of management and budget, Doge and the office of personnel management exceeded their authority and violated administrative law.Illston said plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order, which she said preserves the status quo.Illston said the plaintiffs submitted more than 1,000 pages of evidence and 62 sworn declarations, and she highlighted some of the material.For example, she said the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and its Pittsburgh office, which researches health hazards facing mineworkers, had 221 of the department’s 222 workers terminated, citing the union. She gave similar examples at local offices of the Farm Service Agency, the Social Security Administration and Head Start, which supports early learning.“The court here is not considering the potential loss of income of one individual employee, but the widespread termination of salaries and benefits for individuals, families and communities,” Illston wrote in her ruling.",

            "content": "Raise your hand if you’ve been desperate for Joe Biden to pop up and tell us all, yet again, how he would have handily beaten Donald Trump in 2024.Obviously, I’m not the National Security Agency so I have no idea how many hands are up right now but I’d wager it’s not too many. Still, Biden seems to think we all want to relitigate the November election and has returned to the spotlight to explain exactly what went wrong.In an interview on ABC’s The View on Thursday, the former president took a tiny bit of accountability for the hellscape we are currently living in, noting: “I was in charge and [Trump] won. So, you know, I take responsibility.”Biden should have left it there, but he also explained that he thinks he would have beaten Trump if he hadn’t dropped out of the race due to the entire world seeing evidence of his cognitive decline during that disastrous debate. I don’t know what proof he has to support this idea – not poll numbers, anyway – but it’s always good to believe in yourself!Another thing Biden believes: that Kamala Harris lost the election because of sexism. “I was disappointed but not surprised,” Biden said of Harris’s defeat. “They [Trump voters] went the sexist route.”Trump’s campaign was full of sexist and racist attacks against Harris. Bigotry and misogyny clearly played a part in her defeat.Still, to blame Harris’s defeat on sexism, as Biden does, is a massive cop-out. Harris didn’t lose because she was a mixed-race woman. She lost because Biden’s hubris meant she had very little time to put together a campaign and because, once she was the nominee, she refused to put any distance between herself and Biden’s unpopular policies. To refresh your memory, when Harris went on The View last October, the co-host Sunny Hostin asked her if there was anything the then vice-president would have done differently from Biden, and Harris said “not a thing comes to mind”. A new book by the reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes claims that Biden pressured Harris to ensure there was “no daylight” between the two of them. Biden denied saying this during his appearance on The View – but whoever decided on this strategy, it was disastrous.It’s also disastrous, I think, to keep pushing the narrative, as Biden is doing, that Harris lost because of sexism. Saying that the US isn’t ready to elect a female president is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It makes it more likely that white male candidates, seen as a safer bet, are favoured over women.Yes, there’s plenty of misogyny in the US, but the lesson to take from 2024 isn’t that the country isn’t ready for a female president, it’s that the country is desperately ready for change. A recent poll found that 50% of Democrats want the party to “become more progressive”. Another poll found that “a 58% majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that the Democratic party needs major changes, or to be completely reformed”. Instead of relitigating the past, Democrats need to aggressively rethink their future.This is an old article but since religion is in the news this week I am resurfacing it because the pictures are brilliant.Even your favourite cartoon characters are getting red-pilled. 404 Media reports that a video recently uploaded to the official Dora the Explorer Instagram account featured Dora explaining what “sigma” means. While sigma has gone through various linguistic shifts, it has been used in the manosphere to talk about an extreme form of masculinity. It’s a very weird thing for Dora to be explaining to kids. “Dora that’s not even Spanish you’re losing the PLOT,” one user said, in response. The video has been deleted now and Dora is exploring other things.“It’s a boy!” they joked as blue smoke rose from the ashes of a neighborhood that kids used to play in.A city official in Stockholm has said they received a letter from the US ordering them to scrap the city’s diversity initiatives. “It’s quite unique,” one city official told the Guardian.

Unless you are Melania Trump, that is, in which case you are done working. According to the New York Times, Melania has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House during Trump’s second term. That means Trump “has taken to performing some duties that typically would fall to a first lady. She’s not the one carefully selecting light fixtures for the White House residence, redesigning the Rose Garden, greeting tour groups in the East Wing or hosting receptions for Women’s History Month. He is.”A male security guard stormed into a woman’s bathroom in a Boston hotel and told a woman with short hair to leave because she “was a man”. Your regular reminder that anti-trans policies and rhetoric that reinforce rigid and regressive gender policing ultimately hurt all women.“It’s appalling and it’s just an extension of the culture of cruelty that the administration is trying to perpetrate,” a deputy director at the ACLU told Wired.A harrowing and important piece.A review of UK clinical trial data by the Guardian found that male-only trials (6.1%) were nearly twice as common as female-only studies (3.7%). “This under-representation means there is a lack of evidence on the safety and effectiveness of many interventions in women,” one expert told the Guardian.Move over, Cocaine Bear, hello, Methamphetamine Raccoon.

            "content": "The US president, Donald Trump, on Saturday announced a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan after deadly attacks between the nuclear-armed rivals.Within hours, violations were reported from the main cities of Indian Kashmir, the territory that had borne the brunt of four days of fighting. Blasts were heard in Srinagar and Jammu and projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky over Jammu, similar to the events of the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses.Military spokespeople in both countries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The earlier ceasefire announcement, confirmed by both countries, came after India and Pakistan fired volleys of missiles across their borders on Saturday as they escalated their worst fighting in nearly three decades.The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the agreement came after extensive negotiations by him and the US vice-president, JD Vance, with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials. Both sides had earlier said they would be willing to de-escalate the conflict if the other side was willing to do the same.Rubio, posting on X, said both sides would now start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site. Pakistan’s foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, told broadcaster Geo news on Saturday that three dozen countries were involved in the diplomacy that secured the “full fledged” ceasefire.Earlier on Saturday, Pakistan military officials told state-run media it had launched a retaliatory operation, targeting several bases including a missile storage site in northern India. Officials said the attack was called Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, an Arabic phrase meaning “wall of lead”.Pakistan’s offensive came shortly after it said India had fired missiles from fighter jets at three airbases earlier on Saturday, including one close to the capital, Islamabad. Pakistan said its air defences had intercepted most of them.Among the targets was Nur Khan air base in Rawalpindi, where the Pakistani military has its headquarters, which is around 6 miles (10km) from Islamabad. The strikes caused panic in the densely populated area, with loud explosions sending people running into the streets. In the aftermath of the strikes, Pakistan shut down its airspace.India’s attempted strikes on Rawalpindi and other key military bases – and the launch of Pakistan’s counterattack on Saturday – marked the steepest escalation in their confrontation yet, bringing the two countries the closest they have been to war in decades.Locked in a longstanding dispute over Kashmir, the two countries have engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday, when India launched strikes inside Pakistan on what it called militant bases.At least 48 people have been killed since Wednesday, according to casualty estimates on both sides of the border that have not been independently verified.The dramatic flare-up was sparked by a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, when 26 civilians were killed. India has accused Pakistan of supporting militants behind the attack.",

            "content": "A Soviet-era spacecraft plunged to Earth on Saturday, more than a half century after its failed launch to Venus.The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking agency confirmed its uncontrolled re-entry, based on analysis and the disappearance of the spacecraft from tracking on subsequent orbits. The European Space Agency’s space debris office also indicated it had re-entered the atmosphere after it failed to appear over a German radar station.It was not immediately known where the half-tonne spacecraft came in or how much, if any, of it survived the fiery descent from orbit. Experts said prior to the event that some and perhaps all of it could come crashing down, given it was built to withstand a landing on Venus, the solar system’s hottest planet.The chances of anyone being hit by spacecraft debris were exceedingly low, scientists said.Launched in 1972 by the Soviet Union, the spacecraft Kosmos 482 was part of a series of missions bound for Venus. But this one never made it out of orbit around Earth, stranded there by a rocket malfunction.Much of the spacecraft came tumbling back to Earth within a decade of the failed launch. No longer able to resist gravity’s tug as its orbit dwindled, the spherical lander – an estimated 1 metre across – was the last part of the spacecraft to come down. The lander was encased in titanium, according to experts, and weighed more than 495kg.After the spacecraft’s downward spiral, scientists, military experts and others could not pinpoint in advance precisely when or where the spacecraft might come down. Solar activity added to the uncertainty, along with the spacecraft’s deteriorating condition after so long in space.As of Saturday morning, US Space Command had yet to confirm the spacecraft’s demise as it collected and analysed data from orbit.The military unit routinely monitors dozens of re-entries each month. What set Kosmos 482 apart – and earned it extra attention from government and private space trackers – was that it was more likely to survive re-entry, according to officials.It was also coming in uncontrolled, without any intervention by flight controllers, who normally target the Pacific and other vast expanses of water for old satellites and other space debris.",

            "content": "When the winner of this year’s Eurovision song contest is announced shortly before midnight next Saturday, it won’t be the first climax of the evening. “I’m coming / I’m coming,” a scantily clad Finn will announce in the chorus of her song. Australia’s male entrant will invite listeners to “sh-sh-shake me good” so they can get “a taste of the milkshake man”. And Malta’s submission is going to prompt the audience to shout the word “Kant” – due to it sounding like a rude English term for female genitalia.After the 2024 edition of the world’s largest live music contest was largely overshadowed by political positioning over the war in Gaza, many artists at this year’s event in the Swiss city of Basel are returning to what they like to do best: celebrating the act of lovemaking in pop songs. Because even though the European Broadcasting Union’s official rules ban lyrics “obscene … or otherwise offensive to public morals or decency” from Eurovision’s three live shows, the matrix of what is considered beyond the pale is more complicated. It mostly means you can sing about sex, but you can’t name it. At least not in English.In March, the Maltese performer Miriana Conte was ordered by the EBU to change the lyrics of her song, Kant, the title of which means “singing” in Maltese, but has an obvious phonetic resemblance to the vulgar English word cunt.Now merely entitled “Serving”, the intended original message of Conte’s song was equivalent to the queer or drag slang phrase “serving cunt”, roughly meaning to act in an unapologetically feminine manner, she says. “It’s a celebration of embracing who you are, no matter what you are, how you feel.”Even though English is one of Malta’s two official languages, the 24-year-old singer says she hadn’t received any criticism in her native country, with Maltese media reporting that complaints to the EBU came from the BBC.The C-word topped a recent YouGov survey of the most offensive swearwords in the English language, but its linguistic relatives in many Romance languages – con in French or coño in Spanish – carry less force and can sometimes even be heard on TV.“What might be harmless and playful in one place can be taken differently elsewhere,” says Conte. “It shows that culture shapes our perception of what is vulgar and what is not.”On Saturday, Malta’s entry is likely to receive a similar treatment to the last song to be censored for containing an obscene word, 2022’s Eat Your Salad by Latvian band Citi Zēni.The ode to vegetarianism was written “to make people listen and make them think”, says singer Jānis Pētersons, 30. But the EBU took issue with the (semi) rhyming couplet in the opening verse: “Instead of meat, I eat veggies and pussy / I like them both fresh, like them both juicy.” At the live show, Pētersons simply left out the offending word and got the audience to chant it instead.“The worst lyric you can write is the one that is instantly forgettable,” Pētersonssays. “It was wordplay, and I still think it was smart. Even my grandma thought it was funny.”At Eurovision, Citi Zēni were not just up against Latvian grannies, however, but also Britain’s Auntie. The live show usually starts before the BBC’s 9pm watershed, designed to protect children from potentially harmful content. In most other participating countries, similar watershed rules come into effect at 10pm or later, if they exist at all.It means English-language songs about sex at Eurovision have to either resort to schoolyard synonyms – “I want to do it with him all day long” sang Israeli group Ping Pong in 2000 – or extravagant innuendo, such as Czech singer Mikolas Josef’s “I know you bop-whop-a-lu bop on his wood bamboo” in 2018.Australian singer Go-Jo’s Milkshake Man at this year’s contest is less a double than a single entendre stretched over 40 lines: the eponymous milkshake is “a secret superpower” and makes you “bigger and stronger with harder bones”. It’s a kindred spirit to Montenegro’s 2017 entry Space, by singer Slavko Kalezić, a song single-mindedly devoted to likening sex to intergalactic travel: “The spaceship is ready to blow / Drunk in love I’m gonna explode.”Songs in other languages, by contrast, can get away with being more direct. Finnish singer Erika Vikman’s song “Ich komme” (meaning “I am coming” in German) breezed past the censors. So, too, did last year’s Spanish act Nebulossa, with its title Zorra, literally meaning vixen but commonly translated as bitch or slut.Mais putain, il y a des jours, French singer Nina Morato sang in 1994: “But fuck me, there are days.” Moldova’s 2006 entrant managed to conjure up all sorts of filthy images in viewers’ minds with the lyric: “Hey loco, please espera un poco / And I’ll give you my choco”.In 2012 hip hop group Trackshittaz performed a song in such impenetrably strong Austrian dialect that it must have distracted the censors from their post-watershed name and title of their entry, “Woki mit deim Popo”, “Wiggle your ass”.“As Europe’s lingua franca, English seems to be generally more tightly policed at Eurovision, and mostly by English speakers,” says Paul Marks-Jones, a former president of the official Eurovision fanclub. “The continental Europeans are generally more OK with expletives.”Sweden’s Melodifestivalen, the annual song competition that determines the Nordic country’s Eurovision representative, sparked a debate in 2017 about whether Swedes use fuck too frivolously, when singer Robin Bengtsson used it in his song I Can’t Go on (it was later replaced with “freakin’”).But the complaints came mainly from native English speakers, and Melodifestivalen has subsequently doubled down on its laissez-faire attitude to swearwords. “It is still permissible to use swearing in the show,” says Anders Wistbacka, the executive producer in charge of Melodifestivalen. “Although it is a broad family entertainment programme, we also wish to allow substantial freedom for writers and participants to express their thoughts and feelings.”Is it impossible to imagine a Eurovision of the future that is more at ease with swearing and more relaxed about sex? It can’t be that hard. Oo-er. This article was amended on 10 May 2025. Erika Vikman was described as Lithuanian in the introduction of an earlier version; as was made clear elsewhere, she is Finnish.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/methadone-robot-nursing",
            "content": "Lanea George pulls open a steel security door and enters a windowless room where a video camera stares at what looks like a commercial-grade refrigerator. The machine, dubbed Bodhi, whirrs and spins before spitting out seven small plastic bottles containing precisely 70ml of methadone, a bright pink liquid resembling cherry cough syrup. It is used as a substitute for morphine or heroin in addiction treatment.She scoops the bottles off the tray, bundles them with a rubber band and sets them on a shelf. It’s not yet 10am and George, the nurse manager at Man Alive, an opioid treatment program – known colloquially as a methadone clinic – in Baltimore, has already finished prepping the doses for the 100 or so patients who will arrive the next day. “Bodhi has changed my life and the lives of our patients,” she says.That’s because filling the prescriptions requires more than simply pouring medicine into a bottle. It means printing out and attaching the labels one by one, precisely measuring the amounts, sealing the bottles and screwing on the caps. A spill requires the nurse to stop the work, squeegee the lost liquid into a receptacle, measure it, record the incident and destroy the sample.Repeat that process 100 or more times, and it’s easy to see why, before Bodhi arrived, the task would have occupied a full day. The pressure to keep up causes many nurses to quit, as does the additional misery of carpal tunnel syndrome, which nurses often suffer from screwing on so many caps day after day, according to George.“I’ve seen nurses just leave during a shift and never come back,” she says about previous clinics where she has worked.Now, instead of pouring doses, George spends more time interacting with patients. “It lets me get more personal, have more in-depth conversations,” she says. “That’s where we get a lot of important information.”More patient interaction was the idea when Amber Norbeck came up with the idea for the machine George now uses daily. A pharmacist in the natal intensive care unit at a Montana hospital, Norbeck said so many pregnant women there struggled with opioid dependencies that as many as 50% of the newborns suffered withdrawal symptoms.Methadone therapy helped the new mothers and moms-to-be, but access undermined their efforts; some clinics she visited had 30- to 60-day waiting lists, while at others patients faced three-hour lines despite a flock of nurses toiling at service windows. Some methadone patients are required to return to clinics daily for their doses.“It didn’t look like healthcare, it looked like tellers in a bank pouring methadone,” Norbeck says. “For patients with kids and jobs and lives, getting the medication was so time-consuming that they’d just give up.”As US overdose deaths from opioids rose from roughly 8,000 in 2009 to more than 114,000 in 2022, Norbeck saw a country caught between an opioid crisis and a nursing shortage. In 2019, she and Mike Pokorny, an engineer who had developed his own electric motor, began brainstorming ways to automate the assembly of methadone doses.They devised a robotic device that could pour, seal, label and cap the liquid version of the drug – its most popular form – in seconds. A year later, Norbeck quit her job at the hospital and in January of 2021 the duo founded Opio Connect Inc, with Norbeck as CEO and Pokorny as vice-president.They called the device they built Zing, and it came together quickly because it used parts developed for other kinds of machines. “Existing pharmacy automation solutions weren’t built to handle the kind of variability [that dispensing methadone requires],” says Sam Wilson, Opio’s COO. “So while the components of Zing existed, such as robotics, pumps, labeling tech, etc, no one had applied them to this particular challenge.”The creation of Zing coincided with the rise of Covid-19, which provided a boost. Pre-pandemic, patients who were considered “stable” in their treatment could receive “take-homes”, allowing them to pick up seven or even 14 doses in one visit instead of making a daily trip to the clinic. To reduce in-person contact during the shutdown, federal administrators relaxed the rules on take-homes, making them available to a wider range of patients and in batches for up to 28 days.That policy shift led to more intensive prep and pouring for nurses, but post-Covid research showed that the change caused few problems and provided great benefits to patients, so the new take-home rules became permanent as of January 2024.Sign up to TechScapeA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesafter newsletter promotionBy then, the first Zing had arrived at CompDrug, an opioid treatment program in Columbus, Ohio, complete with its own nickname: Alfie. The seven other Zings that have since come online around the country have likewise received monikers, and the humanizing effect has made them the subjects of naming votes, birthday parties, gender-reveal ceremonies and Halloween dress-up. Together, the fleet has assembled more than 1m doses of methadone.Norbeck expects 30 to 40 more Zings to land by the end of 2025, and the company has its eyes on the 2,100 clinics around the country as well as the prisons, where, she says, “so many in the population need treatment, but they’re notoriously hard places to get nurses to work”.Norbeck knows of no Zing-driven layoffs, but several clinics have been able to leave open positions unfilled and direct the saved money to other treatment programs.“There were concerns that [Zing] would take nurses’ jobs, but the real mission is to free nurses up,” says Pokorny.CompDrug once employed six nurses to pour and distribute methadone all day. Now, three handle the task, aided by a Zing, and the other three take telehealth appointments. All six are still on staff.At Man Alive, Bodhi’s arrival gave George enough free time that she also became the clinic’s home health nurse, helping patients connect with medical care and following up with them on medications and general healthcare issues.Of course, there’s another side to those examples – the nurses who were not hired for open slots, telehealth roles or home health roles. Those jobs may have gone unfilled regardless of robot labor: the Health Resources and Services Administration projects a shortage of 63,720 nurses in 2030, a number that does not capture the attrition accumulated through the pandemic.Norbeck sees her field as one in which robot labor can ease employment shortfalls rather than create them.In Baltimore, George and Man Alive’s other nurse, Mandy Scott, have even started holding educational events in the community and attending in-house group therapy sessions to further connect with patients. Put more simply, George says, “Bodhi lets me be a nurse again.”",

You could dress them with a little olive oil and lemon juice for a salad, and they’d be fantastic lightly cooked with tamarind. I’m looking into where I can buy these in bulk asap.£4.50 for 700g at Ocado★★★★★Heaven. Plump, perfectly seasoned and blissfully soft. Once drained and rinsed, they don’t even need olive oil to improve them – like Bridget Jones, these are perfect just as they are. They’ll elevate any dish that requires gentle cooking, such as a chickpea gratin, rather than a rolling boil. My children adored them, even if it meant unsalted food for the rest of the week.44p for 400g at Asda65p for 400g at Sainsbury’s★★★☆☆The only tin without a ring-pull, which is a hassle, because I hate tin-openers (though, obviously, I do own one). Otherwise I was very impressed: these small chickpeas are very lightly seasoned, and soft enough that you could easily use them in a salad, marinated with oil, lemon juice and a touch more salt. They’d be excellent cooked, too, in a curry or roasted with spices for a snack or salad topper. An excellent and very economical all-rounder.£2.20 for 370g at Waitrose£2.85 for 370g at Ocado★★★★★A very close second to the Brindisa jarred ones. Slightly less seasoned and with a fraction more texture, though still very soft. You certainly wouldn’t need to cook them – they’d be perfect to top a salad or make a ridiculously luxe hummus, although it would be a shame to blitz them when they have such a pleasing texture. Wait until they’re on offer, though, because they’re quite pricey for a small jar.£3.25 for 570g at Ocado£4.70 for 700g at Riverford\n  ★★★★☆Well seasoned, and only slightly less soft than the other two brands of jarred chickpeas, but there’s barely anything in it. I’d happily eat these by the spoonful without dressing, in a salad or lightly cooked – they’d work well with the halloumi in this tabbouleh, because they’re slightly less salty than the other jarred offerings.Sign up to The FilterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

I’d happily put them in a room-temperature chickpea salad with plenty of salt, though they’d be excellent cooked, too – they’d work very well in an all-in-one oven-baked curry, for instance.78p for 400g at Asda£12 for 12 x 400g at Amazon★★★☆☆The ring-pull snapped off when I tried to open the tin, but that may have been more down to my own ineptitude. Once drained and rinsed, these large chickpeas are unseasoned and slightly inconsistent in texture – some soft, some a little crunchy. They were so similar to the M&S chickpeas that I found them hard to tell apart. But what a difference on cooking! I’ve bumped them up from two to three stars because, after being cooked for 25 minutes in a spiced, seasoned sauce, they were superb, absorbing the flavours and improving in texture no end. I’d be very happy to cook with these again.£1.20 for 400g at Ocado£10.17 for 12 x 400g at Amazon★★★☆☆Largely soft and small, these have a pleasant light flavour, even though they’re unseasoned. They’re certainly good enough to go in a room-temperature salad, or if you don’t mind using tinned chickpeas rather than soaked dried ones for hummus, they’d work very well too. Just don’t overdo the tahini: these were the only chickpeas with a discernible flavour other than salt or the lack thereof, so you wouldn’t want to mask that with a shedload of sesame.60p for 400g at Ocado★★☆☆☆These large chickpeas were, like the Napolina offering, a little inconsistent – some were quite soft, others actively crunchy. I wouldn’t use them in a salad, but they were fine once cooked for 25 minutes, absorbing plenty of flavour, if staying very marginally firmer than the Napolina ones. A slightly longer cooking time would remedy that.65p for 400g at Waitrose ☆☆☆☆☆I love Waitrose. Like, really love it – the products, the lighting, the reassuring sense that nothing bad could possibly happen there (see also John Lewis). But no more. Just one of these chickpeas was enough to turn my middle-class worldview to dust. Because, within those flatteringly lit and reassuringly expensive aisles, lurk these monstrosities – chickpeas so actively unpleasant that, by the second taste, I was retching by the sink. Dry, chalky and, despite my best hopes, not even redeemed by a 25-minute simmer. My husband, who is more measured, described them as “comfortably the worst”. (And gently suggested that if I didn’t love Waitrose so much, I might have been marginally less upset by a tin of truly awful own-brand chickpeas.) Whatevs. They’ve lost their last star for wasting a pan of my excellent malai sauce.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/leaders-britain-france-germany-poland-arrive-kyiv-ukraine",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 12:29",
            "content": "European leaders on a joint visit to Kyiv have issued an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers to Ukraine.The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a joint phone call to Donald Trump prior to making the announcement.“All of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,” said UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv.Starmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table.”Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv. It is Macron’s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor, having only taken office this week.“All five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, wrote on X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode.Sybiha added: “Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.”There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call, or on whether Trump had made specific commitments if Putin rejects the ceasefire.Trump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire, but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted.In an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev, wrote on X: “Macron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kiev. Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia … You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.”Instead, Moscow unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday.Thousands of troops marched through Red Square for the annual Victory Day parade, with numerous world leaders in attendance, most notably China’s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vučić, the prime minister of EU member Slovakia and the president of EU hopeful Serbia, respectively, also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders.Fighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.“Putin didn’t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade, and he doesn’t need them now. Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again Putin has refused,” said Starmer.Starmer said Putin had drawn the wrong lessons from the second world war. “We understand the lessons of history, the lesson that any veteran of Normandy or north Africa or of any other campaign will tell you, but that Putin has not yet grasped. There is no glory in aggression and conquest, glory comes from fighting for your country, defending the people, and winning the peace,” he said.Macron also referenced VE Day, and said that “the defence of the principles on which our continent and, more generally, the international order is based” was at stake in the war in Ukraine.The four European leaders visited Kyiv’s Maidan on Saturday morning with Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Thousands of flags have been erected in the central square to remember those killed in the war with Russia. The leaders paid their respects and had a moment of silence, before heading to the talks with Zelenskyy. The five then had a virtual meeting with other leaders on progress being made for a so-called “air, land, maritime and regeneration force” that is planned to be part of a peace deal.Trump has yet to comment publicly on his conversation with the group of leaders. On Friday, he was asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he had a message for Putin. “I have a message for both parties: Get this war ended,” he said, adding: “Get this stupid war finished. That’s my message for both of them.”The Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral.Even the vice-president, JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine, has criticised Moscow’s stance in recent days. “Right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,” he said this week.The US embassy in Kyiv put out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a “potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days”. It did not give further details, but it later emerged that Russia will close its airspace over the Kapustin Yar missile testing range on Monday and Tuesday, which could indicate the potential launch of ballistic missiles.",

            "content": "US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has offered US assistance in starting “constructive talks” to end the conflict between India and Pakistan, as the two states traded heavy missile fire on Saturday, prompting concerns over wider military escalation.Rubio has been engaged in back-and-forth diplomacy between the two countries in recent days, calling for de-escalation as India and Pakistan have been engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday.The US’s top diplomat “continued to urge both parties to find ways to de-escalate and offered US assistance in starting constructive talks to avoid future conflicts,” state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Saturday.Fighting between India and Pakistan started on Wednesday after Indian missiles hit nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people and triggering a cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries. India said Wednesday’s missile strikes were in retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in late April, which saw militants kill 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which India blamed on Pakistan.Clashes peaked on Saturday, as both countries launched missile strikes deep in each other’s territories, using long-range weapons, drone swarms and fighter jets.Both Indian and Pakistani officials have said that they did not wish to see further escalation. At a press briefing on Saturday, Indian military officers said: “Indian armed forces reiterated their commitment to non-escalation, provided the Pakistan side reciprocates.”Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said while they had no “issue to de-escalate,” that he did not trust India’s statements.There has been a flurry of international diplomacy to head off conflict, as despite both India and Pakistan stating that they do not want escalation, there has been a steady uptick in intensity during the week of clashes.The deepening hostilities have raised widespread international concern, with the two nuclear powers closer to war than they have been in decades.US efforts to try to mediate between India and Pakistan have been spearheaded by Rubio, who has been in regular contact with both Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, since the Kashmir attack.India has been a key US ally in the region in recent years, seen as a counter to China’s rising influence – a top policy concern of the Trump administration. The US, in turn, is India’s largest trading partner, and Reuters reports that it has offered preferential trading terms to the Americans in order to secure a stronger partnership with its ally.Nonetheless, the US had earlier seemed reluctant to get involved in the India-Pakistan row, with US president, Donald Trump, calling the tit-for-tat strikes “a shame” earlier in the week. The vice-president, JD Vance, said an India-Pakistan war would be “fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it”.Sign up to First ThingOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionThe US currently does not have an ambassador in India nor Pakistan, as the Trump administration has yet to fill the vacancies.Other countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have stepped in to try to defuse the situation. China, which supplies much of Pakistan’s military hardware, also said that it would be willing to “play a constructive role” to find a solution to fighting.Pakistan’s defence minister said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia was playing a key role as interlocutor and that the Saudi foreign minister had sent a representative to Pakistan.UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, joined G7 ministers in calling for calm, with the G7 issuing a statement on Saturday urging “maximum restraint” from both India and Pakistan. \n “We call for immediate de-escalation and encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue towards a peaceful outcome,” the statement read.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 12:00",
            "content": "The revolving door between the Trump administration and rightwing Fox News took another wild spin this week, as America’s TV-obsessed president tapped Jeanine Pirro for a prominent legal post: top federal prosecutor for Washington DC.Pirro is unqualified, perhaps even more so than was her former Fox colleague Pete Hegseth when he was named Trump’s defense secretary a few months ago. In that crucial position, Hegseth has been a dangerous embarrassment, as his shockingly inappropriate communications have exposed national security secrets to the world.Pirro, although once a county-level district attorney, hasn’t held a government legal position in decades. But she has been opining on Fox for 14 years, mostly recently as a host on The Five, the network’s popular afternoon talkshow.But no matter. She “is in a class by herself”, Trump wrote on social media in announcing his intention to make her the interim (and perhaps permanent) prosecutor.His description may be accurate, but surely not in the way he intends.Pirro’s record at Fox is startlingly checkered, even for that propaganda outfit. She got in trouble with the network’s brass a few years ago for her eager promotion of Trump’s lies about supposed voter fraud in the 2020 election. (The voting-fraud lies became part of a defamation lawsuit against the network by a voting-systems company; Fox paid nearly $800m to settle the case and had to acknowledge that statements made on air were false.)Fox once suspended her for her ugly commentary on Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s wearing a hijab, which Pirro suggested was an adherence to “sharia lawm which in itself is antithetical to the United States constitution”. And she advocated for a “cleansing” of the FBI and the justice department because their ranks were full of people who “need to be taken out in handcuffs”.But none of this causes any real concern for the president, apparently, because Pirro has one huge thing going for her. Over the course of a long friendship and many visits to Mar-a-Lago, she has been relentlessly loyal to Trump.In fact, she has gone well beyond loyalty into straight-up sycophancy.On this score, Pirro has what it takes.“Since Trump returned to office, Pirro has kept busy by showering him with praise and lashing out at anyone who stands in his way,” wrote Matt Gertz, senior fellow at the progressive watchdog group Media Matters, noting that she is the 23rd former Fox employee whom Trump has tapped for his administration.Tom Homan, a former Fox contributor, became Trump’s “border czar”, aggressively carrying out the administration’s anti-immigrant policy, and Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and former host of a weekly Fox show, was named ambassador to Israel.Beyond her peerless cheerleading, Pirro would be useful to Trump in practical terms, noted the New York Times in a news story.She supports “Trump’s efforts to exact vengeance on his political enemies, has backed his challenges to federal judges who have questioned the legality of his immigration policies and spent months protesting the legitimacy” of Biden’s 2020 election to the presidency.Although Trump often doesn’t return the favor of loyalty, he has stepped up for Pirro’s family by pardoning her former husband (once Trump’s lawyer), who in 2020 was convicted of conspiracy and tax-evasion charges.All told, this is some serious symbiosis. In stepping away from her high-profile – and high-earning – TV job, Pirro may solve a sticky problem for Trump, whose earlier choice for the DC prosecutor’s position ran into trouble with Senate Republicans.It’s not clear if Pirro’s nomination will succeed, especially in the long term. Although Trump is nominating her on an interim basis, there’s little doubt he’d like it to be permanent. But even the interim appointment may run into a legal fight over just how many acting US attorneys the president can appoint consecutively.You might think that with Hegseth’s rocky and widely criticized start as defense secretary – where he oversees almost three million employees while maintaining a TV star’s firm jawline – the president would hesitate to choose another unqualified TV personality for a key role.But Trump clearly doesn’t see it that way.There’s hardly anything better, it turns out, than Fox News on one’s resume. Even better when it’s paired with a solid record of fealty to the Audience in Chief.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/cannabis-medical-research-bill",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 12:00",
            "content": "A recently introduced bill, if it passes, would allow research on cannabis despite its schedule I status, which some experts say could help policymakers “craft effective” legislation in the future and potentially allow more clinical research on medical cannabis.Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA) last week, which would radically ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances.Omar said in a statement that the law would allow research to catch up with the US’s increasing cannabis consumption: “We need drug policy to follow the science and reflect the reality on the ground in states across the country.”Schedule I substances, including cannabis, heroin and MDMA, are legally defined as having “no accepted medical use” and a “high potential for abuse”. Medical cannabis proponents point out that cannabis’s federal schedule I status is contradictory, given that patients throughout the US already use cannabis for medical purposes.The Biden administration pushed for cannabis to be reclassified as a schedule III substance, which would alter its legal status and make cannabis-based medicines eligible for FDA approval.But the rescheduling process has continued to stall since Donald Trump reentered the oval office.Unlike rescheduling, the EBDPA would be simple to enact. In its current form, it repeals sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of schedule I substances, and that require the ONDCP to oppose any attempts to legalize schedule I substances.Still, there are questions as to whether this bill has the ability to pass.Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University, says that the bill is a “modest proposal” and “it might be possible for it to gain the bipartisan support it needs to pass”.Cat Packer, director of Drug Markets and Legal Regulation at Drug Policy Alliance, notes that the bill “has the potential to attract bipartisan support as a modest but meaningful step forward” due to it prioritizing “evidence over ideology”.Though more comprehensive federal cannabis reform might be in the distant future, “the EBDPA should be seen as a neutral step that would enable policymakers to study what works – and be better prepared to craft effective, informed legislation in the future,” Packer added.On the other hand, Aaron Smith, CEO of the National Cannabis Industry Association, doesn’t feel as hopeful and that because of “the hyper-partisan times we live in, getting this bill, or any legislation, frankly, passed isn’t likely in the near term”.Packer hopes that policymakers will see that the bill is vital for shaping smart cannabis policy.“The federal government cannot meaningfully learn from the experiences of the 24-plus states that have legalized cannabis,” Packer says of the current state of affairs.There aren’t ways at the moment for the federal government to scientifically measure cannabis’ impact on youth consumption and health outcomes, arrest and incarceration rates, and who benefits economically from legal cannabis policies, versus who is left out.Existing policy is not only outdated, but there’s “an institutional blindfold that prevents the federal government from adapting to real-world conditions and designing effective, responsive policies”, Packer said.Ideally, Harris says the law would lead to “an increase in rigorous research to inform medical use practice”, noting that there are many questions when it comes to how cannabis functions as a medicine, about ideal doses, long term-impacts of different consumption methods, and whether certain strains work better for some conditions than others.While Omar and Titius have emphasized cannabis when promoting the bill, it would allow federal funding to go toward research on other schedule I substances as well.Smith said that “drug policy should be rooted in scientific fact” and that any step in that direction should be applauded. Harris echoed that sentiment, noting that research on other schedule I substances is “much needed,” given that “several substances in schedule I – psilocybin and MDMA in particular, seem to have therapeutic effects for some people with difficult-to-treat conditions”. Federally funded medical research on the efficacy of these drugs could advance medicine in the US.“If there is evidence to support FDA approval for a schedule I drug for therapeutic applications, this bill would mean that the Office of National Drug Control Policy would not have to reflexively oppose it,” Harris said.Should the bill pass, Harris is skeptical of how much federal funding will actually go to schedule I research as “the Trump administration, so far, has seemed opposed to federal research funding more broadly”.Still, she says: “This bill is an important and reasonable effort to improve the sensibility of federal drug policies, but the current climate could dampen its short-term effects.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 12:00",
            "content": "Artificial intelligence companies have been urged to replicate the safety calculations that underpinned Robert Oppenheimer’s first nuclear test before they release all-powerful systems.\n Max Tegmark, a leading voice in AI safety, said he had carried out calculations akin to those of the US physicist Arthur Compton before the Trinity test and had found a 90% probability that a highly advanced AI would pose an existential threat. \n The US government went ahead with Trinity in 1945, after being reassured there was a vanishingly small chance of an atomic bomb igniting the atmosphere and endangering humanity.In a paper published by Tegmark and three of his students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), they recommend calculating the “Compton constant” – defined in the paper as the probability that an all-powerful AI escapes human control. In a 1959 interview with the US writer Pearl Buck, Compton said he had approved the test after calculating the odds of a runaway fusion reaction to be “slightly less” than one in three million.Tegmark said that AI firms should take responsibility for rigorously calculating whether Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) – a term for a theoretical system that is superior to human intelligence in all aspects – will evade human control.“The companies building super-intelligence need to also calculate the Compton constant, the probability that we will lose control over it,” he said. “It’s not enough to say ‘we feel good about it’. They have to calculate the percentage.”Tegmark said a Compton constant consensus calculated by multiple companies would create the “political will” to agree global safety regimes for AIs.Tegmark, a professor of physics and AI researcher at MIT, is also a co-founder of the Future of Life Institute, a non-profit that supports safe development of AI and published an open letter in 2023 calling for pause in building powerful AIs. The letter was signed by more than 33,000 people including Elon Musk – an early supporter of the institute – and Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple.The letter, produced months after the release of ChatGPT launched a new era of AI development, warned that AI labs were locked in an “out-of-control race” to deploy “ever more powerful digital minds” that no one can “understand, predict, or reliably control”.Tegmark spoke to the Guardian as a group of AI experts including tech industry professionals, representatives of state-backed safety bodies and academics drew up a new approach for developing AI safely.The Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities report was produced by Tegmark, the world-leading computer scientist Yoshua Bengio and employees at leading AI companies such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind. It set out three broad areas to prioritise in AI safety research: developing methods to measure the impact of current and future AI systems; specifying how an AI should behave and designing a system to achieve that; and managing and controlling a system’s behaviour.Referring to the report, Tegmark said the argument for safe development in AI had recovered its footing after the most recent governmental AI summit in Paris, when the US vice-president, JD Vance, said the AI future was “not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety”.Tegmark said: “It really feels the gloom from Paris has gone and international collaboration has come roaring back.”",

            "content": "Newcastle: If recent form seems encouraging – Newcastle are seeking an eighth victory in 10 games in all competitions – they will miss the combative presence of the injured Joelinton on the left of Eddie Howe’s midfield three. Joe Willock has not convinced entirely in that role since the Brazilian damaged a knee and much the same could be said of Alexander Isak. On his day the Sweden striker is unplayable but since Newcastle’s Carabao Cup triumph Isak has often been a shadow of his best self. Is it the minor groin injury he is carrying, or even a desire to move on to pastures new this summer? Given the importance of Kieran Trippier and Fabian Schär, Howe will be keeping everything crossed that those two key defenders pass late fitness tests. LTChelsea: It feels like the atmosphere around the club completely changed when late goals from Tyrique George and Pedro Neto enabled them to fight back from 1-0 down to beat Fulham last month. A first away win since December eased the pressure on Enzo Maresca, generating momentum at a vital point. Strong at home, Chelsea followed up the heist at Fulham with a gritty victory over Everton at Stamford Bridge, then took advantage of a drop in Liverpool’s standards by beating the newly crowned champions last week. It has been an impressive revival after a worrying few months. Chelsea look hungry. Nicolas Jackson has rediscovered his scoring touch and the return of Roméo Lavia in midfield has made a huge difference. Chelsea are a different team when Lavia is fit. There is still much to prove, though. Can this young side hold their nerve against direct competitors for a top-five spot? Chelsea have lost their past three games at St James’ Park. JSNewcastle: Although Newcastle are not in peril of breaching profitability and sustainability regulations (PSR) rules, a place in one of Europe’s lesser competitions would probably restrict their maximum summer spending to about £75m before any sales. Champions League involvement should virtually double that budget. Several of the club’s commercial deals, the Adidas kit sponsorship included, rise appreciably in value if a top-five finish is secured. Europa or Conference League involvement would also increase the probability of Howe losing at least one leading player and quite possibly unsettle his star striker, Isak. Conversely, rubbing shoulders with Europe’s elite would enable Newcastle to keep not only Isak but Bruno Guimarães too. It would also make it easier to acquire a number of high-profile targets, including Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo, Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi, Burnley’s James Trafford, Ipswich’s Liam Delap and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. Finishing sixth or seventh would mean Howe had failed to trigger a contractual £3m Champions League bonus clause that would boost his salary to around £9m per year. LTChelsea: The club have not qualified since being bought by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital in 2022. Spending two seasons in the wilderness has not done wonders for their finances. Complying with the Premier League’s PSR has required some clever accountancy, so it would help Chelsea if they returned to a competition they won in 2012 and 2021. Maresca has admitted that failing to qualify would have an impact on his transfer budget, although it should not be forgotten that Chelsea are in line for a handsome payout from their participation in this summer’s expanded Club World Cup. They believe they are going in the right direction. Maresca is an inexperienced coach and has struggled at times during his first season in charge but the club want to persist with the Italian. Supporters may not be as forgiving as the board if Chelsea miss out. JSSign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionNewcastle: Joelinton’s absence dictates that Willock has big midfield boots to fill. Isak could do with winning his attacking beauty contest with Chelsea’s Cole Palmer. Sandro Tonali needs to emphasise why he ranks among Europe’s finest in the No 6 position and the inconsistent Guimarães must rediscover his A game. Although Jacob Murphy and Harvey Barnes have impressed of late, this might be the moment for Anthony Gordon to start his first game since March. Howe rarely deviates from 4-3-3 but is this the time to surprise Chelsea with a tactical revamp? With the influential defender Sven Botman fully fit again, a switch to a back three or 4-2-3-1 are options. Should Maresca persist with his risky habit of playing out from the back, Howe’s hard, high, 4-3-3 pressing machine could steamroller Chelsea. With a tricky trip to Arsenal next Sunday, Newcastle will not settle for a draw. LTChelsea: Nothing fancy here – you can’t look past Palmer. The 23-year-old makes Chelsea tick and his mojo was back against Liverpool. A late penalty ended an 18-match goal drought and there was encouragement from a performance full of Palmer’s trademark creative genius. Not that Chelsea are a one-man team. Moisés Caicedo was named the club’s player of the year last week. The midfielder has continued to excel since being deployed as an auxiliary right-back. The ploy has allowed Maresca to put Lavia next to Enzo Fernández, who has been in fine goalscoring form. Jackson’s return from a hamstring injury has also sharpened the attack. As for the defence, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah will have to be at their best against Isak. JS",

            "content": "There’s something about its perfect balance of crunch and tenderness that makes roast pork belly such a timeless favourite, and slow-roasting fills the kitchen with comforting aromas that make you hungry long before the meat is anywhere near ready. I like to serve it with mojo verde, a vibrant sauce from the Canaries that’s often served with papas arrugadas, the island’s wonderfully salty and wrinkled take on potatoes. The sauce’s fresh, herby flavour works beautifully with roast meat, too, and brings a bright contrast to rich, crisp pork in particular.Prep 15 min \n Cook 3 hr 30 min\n Serves 4-61½kg pork belly (ideally outdoor-reared), skin scored2 tbsp olive oil\n  2 tsp sweet smoked pimentón\n  Salt and black pepper\n  2 tbsp honey\n  200ml dry sherry\n  150ml chicken stock\n  Zest of 1 lemon, pared off in stripsFor the mojo verde1 bunch spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and grated1 green chilli, stalk, pith and seeds discarded, flesh finely chopped100g fresh coriander, finely chopped50g fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped2 tbsp sherry vinegar\n  120ml extra-virgin olive oilHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7.

            "title": "Crass, flashy, outrageous: Trump media blitz redefines meaning of presidential",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/trump-media-white-house-communications",
            "content": "There was a disturbance in the Force. Donald Trump celebrated “Star Wars Day” this week with an AI-generated image of himself as a muscle-bound warrior holding a red lightsaber in front of two US flags and eagles.It seemed like a bit of fun but appeared on the White House’s official X account with a dark political message: “Happy May the 4th to all, including the Radical Left Lunatics who are fighting so hard to bring Sith Lords, Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, & well known MS-13 Gang Members, back into our Galaxy. You’re not the Rebellion – you’re the Empire. May the 4th be with you.”Star Wars nerds were quick to point out that a red lightsaber implies that Trump has embraced the Dark Side. Actor Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, wrote on social media: “Proof this guy is full of SITH.” But the joking-not-joking post was also indicative of a wider trend: a revolution in the way the White House communicates with the American public.Over the past three and a half months the US president and his team have launched a relentless media offensive based on crass language, flashy tactics, shock-value videos and social media memes and posts that are outrageous by design. They have used platforms and personalities to bypass traditional outlets and directly engage the Maga (Make America great again) base. They have found new ways to drown out critics, goad opponents and antagonise the world.The embrace of viral far-right culture has nurtured a parallel information ecosystem through pro-Trump outlets enjoying a significant growth in influence, access to power and financial investment. It is helping the president dominate the “attention economy” and reshape narratives around the economy, immigration and other policy issues. But it also alarms critics who warn that insults and lies are going unchecked.Tara Setmayer, a political commentator and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Donald Trump has always understood mass communication and the power of propaganda and his rise and success politically will go down in history as one of the most successful propaganda operations ever. He has completely upended any semblance of decency, of class, of gravitas when it comes to presidential communications.“It’s literally turning presidential methods of communication into the WWE – the imagery, the immaturity, the outrageousness. All of those things seem to be more important than truth or respect for the office and what it means to use the power of the bully pulpit to speak to the American people and the world.”Presidential communications have come a long way. Woodrow Wilson held the first presidential press conference in 1913. Franklin Roosevelt pioneered radio with his informal “fireside chats” during the Great Depression and the second world war, articulating policies such as the New Deal directly to citizens.John F Kennedy leveraged TV for live addresses, for example during the Cuban missile crisis. Ronald Reagan, a former actor, relished televised addresses, earning the nickname “the great communicator”. Barack Obama was the first president to use platforms such as YouTube and Twitter extensively, hosting online town halls and bypassing old media.Over the past decade Trump has combined the old with the new, holding traditional in-person rallies while also being prolific on Twitter during his first term – a single all caps tweet could dominate headlines, move financial markets or upend global diplomacy – and now his own Truth Social platform.But only since returning to office has he turned the White House into a quasi-content provider in its own right, continuing the aggressive media strategy they honed during his winning election campaign to achieve what his communications director, Steven Cheung, has called “full spectrum dominance”.In January Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, posted a photo of men in chains boarding a plane and wrote: “Deportation flights have begun.” In February the White House posted on X a Valentine’s Day card with the faces of Trump and “border czar” Tom Homan with the caption: “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally and we’ll deport you.”It also posted a video of shackled migrants being loaded on to planes, with the sounds of clanking chains and whirring jet engines in the background. The caption said “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.” In March, on the day of Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, the White House’s rapid-response account posted more than 200 times to X, promoting clips and favourable reactions.Trump has spent his career living by the rule that, when he takes a hit, he hits back harder. That philosophy now infuses the White House. When the actor Selena Gomez posted an Instagram video in which she cried about the deportation of children, it quickly produced video interviews with the mothers of children killed by undocumented immigrants.When Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland man with protected legal status, was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, Leavitt said “outrage” about the case by Democrats and the media “has been nothing short of despicable”. Dozens of posters of arrested undocumented immigrants were placed along the White House driveway, ensuring they would appear in the live shots of TV journalists.Some content is downright bizarre. The White House shared a photo of a fake Time magazine cover with Trump in a golden crown and the caption, “LONG LIVE THE KING.” Another post contained an AI-generated video that showed the Gaza Strip transformed into a luxurious, gilded resort called “Trump Gaza”. And earlier this month Trump shared an AI-generated image of himself dressed as pope as the mourning of Pope Francis continued.Setmayer, who now runs the Seneca Project political action committee, commented: “It’s so outrageous that it would be comical if it weren’t so serious. There’s nothing funny or comical about insulting one of the world’s largest religions and putting yourself in that role. It’s blasphemous. But it’s also a window into how Donald Trump views himself: this is part of that malignant narcissism.“He is so desperate for adulation and attention and being all powerful that he would project himself in a cartoon-like rendering of positions of power using the white House platform to push it. This is something a maladjusted 12-year-old does. Not the most powerful man in the world.”The Trump White House has a symbiotic relationship with a new wave of podcasters, X users and YouTubers who enjoy access to the briefing room and presidential press pool, often asking Trump conspicuously sycophantic questions. Employees of outlets such as the National Pulse and the Daily Wire have been invited on foreign trips with cabinet officials. The exposure is leading to bigger advertising deals and distribution contracts.No one embodies the new era of White House communications better than Leavitt, who at 27 is the youngest ever press secretary and probably the most zealously on-message. She has shown an uncanny ability to channel Trump’s political psyche, his relish for disparaging the so-called legacy media and his willingness to play fast and loose with facts.Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: “She’s approaching it in a very different way than others have done. She is forthrightly being a person who communicates the message of the White House rather than responds to the questions of the press. You can query whether that’s the job she ought to be doing but she is doing it in an outstanding way.“She is mature beyond her years. She’s articulate. She both can deliver the message and respond in an interactive way, which is something that some press secretaries have difficulty with. If the job of the press secretary is to send the message of the administration on a regular basis in person she is knocking the ball out of the park.”But Mike McCurry, who was White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton, is among those who query if that is what the job is about. He said: “She seems to be in nonstop belligerent mode and showing disdain for the reporters in the room. It’s nothing but a propaganda show. She’s not doing the job as it’s traditionally been defined. She’s got a whole different role in the Trump cosmos.”Leavitt presents a weekly “Maga Minute” roundup video on TikTok, YouTube and other platforms. Last week also saw the launch of White House Wire, a news-style website that publishes exclusively positive coverage. Its format closely resembles the Drudge Report, the rightwing site founded in the 1990s that broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal.When he was working for Clinton, McCurry initially tried to dismiss questions about Lewinsky by retorting: “Are you really going to ask a question based on something in the Drudge Report?” He acknowledges that today’s White House is operating in a very different media environment – but argues that is no excuse for its lack of accountability.McCurry said: “The concept is if you keep throwing stuff up against the wall all the time, the press tries to chase everything down and they get befuddled a little bit because they don’t have a way of focusing back on things that might truly matter in the world“It’s a strategy to try to overwhelm all of the legitimate sources of discourse and just keep changing the tune every day to match whatever it is that you want to try to get done. It’s either completely malevolent or completely brilliant. It’s hard to know which.”",

            "content": "In the wake of a brutal set of local election results, MPs from across the Labour party are trying to establish what went wrong. To me, it’s very clear that this was no fluke: it was the entirely foreseeable outcome of my party’s approach to Reform UK. And as the party moves forward and prepares to face Reform at future elections, it’s key that we learn the right lessons.From flip-flopping on climate commitments to framing disabled people as part of the undeserving poor, Labour thus far hasn’t challenged Reform’s worldview – it has legitimatised it. However, there are some perhaps surprising areas where Labour isn’t copying Reform: public ownership of water for one.While keen to outbid them on immigration, we seem remarkably reluctant to do the same for the ownership of water, despite high levels of support for such a policy. The Reform party – never one to let principle get in the way of populism – has now reinvented itself as a champion of public infrastructure, with a plan that would see the government and British pension funds owning the companies that supply water and energy. That’s the playbook of rightwing populists: ideological coherence is optional. If it polls well, claim it.Public anger is hardly a surprise. Private water companies have drained the system dry. Since privatisation, they’ve paid billions in dividends to shareholders while piling up debt, polluting rivers and neglecting infrastructure. Sewage spills into our waterways have become routine. Reservoirs have been sold off. Executive pay has soared. And still, prices rise for the rest of us. Regulators – supposed sentinels of public interest – have acted more like apologists.As issues go, this could have been written for Reform. The state of English water taps into something deep – something visceral. It has become a symbol of a rigged economy, a failed regulatory state and a political class that either can’t or won’t fix what it broke. In the eyes of many, the system is rotten, the profiteers are protected, and no one in power is willing to take them on.And yet Reform is part of the same neoliberal project that caused and benefits from this 40-year malaise. Behind both the party and the private ownership of water companies are the same types of forces that have turned life’s essentials – housing, energy, water – into speculative gambling chips, where the house always wins and the public always loses. Labour should be contesting this ground by relentlessly pummelling their hypocrisy, and blaming the Tories for being the architects of it all, while offering a real alternative.It’s an open goal, with the public crying out for the bold change promised in our manifesto. What they got instead was the Water (Special Measures) Act – a measure as underwhelming as its name. Touted as a landmark intervention, in truth it landed with all the heft of a damp sponge. Feargal Sharkey, the rock star turned river-activist and de facto conscience of the nation’s waterways, dismissed it as a missed opportunity for leadership. “Nothing but playground politics masquerading as policy,” he wrote. “Since when has rearranging the deckchairs, regurgitating an existing, failed 30-year-old bit of legislation been seen as progress?”As Thames Water teeters on the edge of collapse – under the weight of its own reckless finance model – the government had another chance to act. To rewrite the rules of the game. But again, it flinched. Instead of a public conversation about reclaiming essential infrastructure, we got another review. This one is led by Sir John Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England whose career suggests he is at home with the idea that the economy should be run in the interests of “wealth creators”: banks, private equity, financial speculators – the very orthodoxy that created this mess.Crucially, public ownership was ruled out before the review had even begun.This was no accident. It was a calculated abdication – a decision to preserve the financial status quo rather than challenge it and surrender to market dogma, corporate extractionism and price-gouging. By ruling it out, the government signals that it’s more comfortable tweaking the edges than challenging the system that caused the crisis in the first place.And when that system appears to include collusion with private water companies and cosy ties with foreign investment companies like BlackRock, it’s no wonder people feel shut out. No wonder Reform voters feel justified in denouncing Labour as just another establishment party protecting the powerful from the people. What other conclusion is there when Labour is overseeing a continuation of the same technocratic politics that got us here? Where government appears to manage only in the interests of the wealthy, financial giants and corporations. For how else does a Labour government conclude that pensioners and disabled people should be sacrificed to preserve a fiscal rule created to ensure the maintenance of wealth for those who already have it?Labour must reconnect with the understanding that the public are not cogs for the benefit of an abstract economy. They are the economy. Until we remember this, our current approach is not just bad strategy – it’s bad for democracy. Because when voters see politicians working closely with the same kinds of firms that crashed the economy or cashed in during the pandemic, trust collapses. And without bold, people-first, democracy deepening ideas, Labour risks becoming part of the problem it promised to fix.Four years out from the next general election, there still remains a clear path forward. Labour must rediscover its courage and reorient itself around economic democracy – public ownership that listens, responds, and empowers communities. The evidence is overwhelming that voters seek meaningful change, not more of the same dressed in the language of pragmatism.The alternative, as the local election results underline starkly, is continuing electoral punishment from an electorate weary of unmet promises and compromised principles. If Labour truly wishes to deliver on its promise of national renewal, it must abandon the hollow rhetoric of “tough choices” and embrace genuinely transformative ones – starting with water. This means more than just traditional renationalisation: we need public ownership where workers, customers and the new devolved strategic authorities own and run the service, and a citizens’ assembly, giving the public a real say on the shape and structure of English water in the future. Because Nigel Farage offers people an agenda of fake reform. If Labour wants to beat him, it must offer the real thing.Clive Lewis is the Labour MP for Norwich South",

            "content": "Thanksgiving in the Cotswolds is no small affair. Every November, Americans flock to the English market town of Stow-on-the-Wold to collect glazed turkey breasts, green bean casserole and a traditional sweet potato dish covered in marshmallows.It is, by Jesse D’Ambrosi’s own admission, “bizarre”. The chef, owner of D’Ambrosi Fine Foods, is one of the many Americans who have made the Cotswolds their home in recent years. Here, her Thanksgiving and Fourth of July food hampers are highly coveted.Now as Donald Trump settles into his second administration, the lure of the rolling Oxfordshire hills has grown stronger for many of her compatriots.“I’ve seen a lot of Americans scoping and checking out the area,” she said. “Obviously it’s political. Why wouldn’t you want to leave where that guy is in action? It is very scary times, especially for women.”It is an increasingly common view as Trump’s authoritarian clampdown and attacks on academia, civil society and political opponents send shock waves through the US and leave some Americans reaching for their passports.US applications for UK citizenship hit a record high last year at more than 6,100, a 26% increase from 2023. There was a 40% year-on-year rise during the final three months of the year, around the time of Trump’s re-election.In the prime London real estate market, which covers areas such as Knightsbridge and Mayfair, the number of American buyers overtook Chinese buyers for the first time last year, analysis by the property agent Knight Frank found.But the prospect of an idyllic life in the English countryside is also growing increasingly popular. Harry Gladwin, from the Buying Solution estate agency in the Cotswolds, says a significant proportion of his clients are now Americans hoping to plot a route abroad.“Since the re-election of Trump there has been a big rise in Americans looking at the UK as a place to anchor themselves,” he said.“There are multiple draws: it is a safe place to hold properties; young families often want to have a holiday home with a view to spending more time here in the long term; and older couples who want to spend more time in the UK use it as a stepping stone into Europe.“Many of them are younger people who made money in tech and want to have some property elsewhere. There are finance people from the east coast, as well as people in media, especially in film.”There is no shortage of Hollywood glamour in the Cotswolds, with its chocolate box villages and honey-hued cottages providing a bucolic setting. Some scenes in The Holiday, the 2000s romcom starring Cameron Diaz and Jude Law, were filmed close to Chipping Norton. The Oxfordshire town of Bampton was the location for village scenes in the hit period drama Downton Abbey. Last year the former chatshow star Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, relocated to the Cotswolds, reportedly because of Trump’s return to the White House.Luxury brands and lifestyle businesses are following the money. The Gallery at Aynhoe Park, an outpost of the luxury American furniture brand RH, reopened the Grade I-listed landmark two years ago as an extravagant showroom. The private members’ club Soho Farmhouse and Daylesford Organic, which has expanded from a farm and furniture shop to a campus-style, five-star experience with pool, spa and padel courts, also cater for the influx. Estelle Manor, a country club in a Grade II-listed hall in Eynsham, charges a standard membership of £3,600 a year, plus a £1,000 joining fee.D’Ambrosi, who lived in France and Amsterdam before settling in the UK, opened a fine foods store in Stow-on-the-Wold a few months before the pandemic hit in 2020. She has amassed a loyal following for her colourful, healthy cooking, as well as shelves dedicated to American staples including grape jelly, pancake mix and pickles, which she describes as her “hillbilly section”.“We have a tremendous number of American clients who are based between the Cotswolds and London,” she said. “We are in the Hamptons of England. We have gastropubs on every corner, high-end shopping in Daylesford and there is the accessibility factor of being able to get to London within an hour and 20 minutes.”Daniel Holder, at R Scott & Co, a menswear shop in Cirencester, said most Americans investigating the area wanted to stay in the UK as long as possible as they do not want to go back to the States.“They spend a lot of money,” he said. “It’s mainly tweed sports jackets, flat caps and knitwear. They watch Peaky Blinders then come in and ask for a cap.”Nathan Hanafin-Smith, of Cirencester Antiques Centre, says American shoppers often arrive with a particular interest in Roman coins found in the area. “These coins are 2,000 years old or more in some cases,” he said. “It shocks them, as a lot of our coins are older than where they come from. It puts things in perspective for them.”Wealth managers report more queries from Americans aiming to move their assets away from the country. Sean Cockburn, of the tax specialist group Forvis Mazars, said there had been a notable increase in interest in relocating to the UK over the past three years.“While some are concerned about the potential tax exposure resulting from the abolition of the non-dom regime, others will welcome the new exemptions that have been introduced for those coming to live in the UK for a shorter period,” he said.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotion“In particular, the ability to exempt foreign income and gains from UK taxation for the first four years of UK residence will make the UK very attractive for short-term visitors,” he said. In most cases, however, Americans will still be expected to pay towards tax in the US.“The IRS will continue to apply federal income tax on their worldwide income, even when they have ceased to be resident in the US,” Cockburn said. “So whilst a US person might initially be elated at the prospect of avoiding UK taxation on their foreign income and gains, the benefit is likely to be significantly eroded by having a larger US tax liability.”But political fears are potent enough to keep driving wealthy Democrats away, says Armand Arton, of Arton Capital, an international citizenship specialist that advises high net worth individuals.Many American families are now thinking about a plan B, he says. “The Democrats are fleeing. The higher the profile, the higher the anti-Trump rhetoric they expressed, the more serious they are about taking those steps.”Trump’s attacks on academia also appear to be fuelling the exodus. US clicks on British job listings were up 2.4 percentage points year on year to 8.5%, the sharpest increase from any country, according to the job search site Indeed. That rise was largely driven by Americans looking for roles in scientific research and development.Trump has gutted funding for medical research in universities, hospitals and other scientific institutions, targeting Harvard in particular. In February, the National Institutes of Health said it would reduce the amount of “indirect” medical research funding by $4bn a year. Universities across the country have reduced their intake of PhD students, medical students and other graduate students, introduced hiring freezes and in some cases rescinded offers of admission.This has created a “massive opportunity” for the UK to actively recruit American scientists, according to Sir John Bell, the renowned immunologist and president of Oxford’s Ellison Institute of Technology.Speaking to the House of Lords science and technology committee last month, he said leaders in the biomedical research field in the US were already asking when they could move.“Do the thought experiment: you are an outstanding scientist, you are sitting in an American institution, and things are not looking good,” he said. “You know for sure that they are going to be bad for four years, they are probably going to be bad for eight years, and it will take another four years to get the thing back on its feet again.“If you are a great scientist in your late 40s or early 50s, there is no way you are going to sit it out.”About 6,680 American students applied for UK courses for the traditional deadline at the end of January this year, according to Ucas, the national universities admissions service. That marked a 12% increase compared with last year, and the highest number since records began in 2006.But Americans making the leap may have to accept lower pay in the UK, especially in tech. The average salary advertised for a software engineer in the US on Indeed is $123,530 (£93,030), compared with £48,796 in the UK.American firms are waking up to the threat posed by Trump’s second term. Doug Winter, the chief executive of the tech firm AI Seismic, based in San Diego, California, is actively preparing to convince his workers not to leave the States for the UK.“The UK and other international markets are dangling a carrot that US tech workers may be tempted to bite,” he said. “This is largely owed to the ongoing uncertainty throughout the US, as well as broader economic instability.“Historically, the US tech ecosystem has been resilient, and many US workers trusted that their employers would see them through uncertain times. But that confidence is being tested.”",

            "content": "Monica Dolan is so gentle and unassuming that, sitting in a giant armchair in a London hotel, she looks as if she could be swallowed up by its upholstery. But then, the Middlesbrough-born 56-year-old has made her name dissolving into roles – especially those inspired by real people. She won a Bafta for her chilling performance as serial killer Rose West in 2011’s Appropriate Adult, and rave reviews for her turn as kooky life insurance scammer Anne Darwin in The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe. Last year, her appearance in ITV’s Mr Bates vs the Post Office as the fierce Jo Hamilton – the post office operator who faced criminal charges when a computer system failure led to her and hundreds of others being wrongly accused of theft – became a national talking point. The four-part British drama, which aired in January 2024, prompted public outrage. In the aftermath of the show, the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells handed back her CBE and the government was pressed into launching a new compensation scheme.You won best supporting actress at the Baftas 13 years ago. Now you’re nominated again. Does it feel different this time?\n It’s a bit like when you go back to your first school and the chairs look really small. Whereas before I felt like I was trying to get into a world, now I feel slightly more like I’m, hopefully, in it – and welcoming other people as well.Mr Bates vs the Post Office caused real-world action. How did it feel when that played out?\n I was shocked by the audience reaction, and how proud I was of the audience reaction.I saw that the compensation, promised after the show’s success, is taking longer than post office operators were hoping.\n  They’ve actually re-engaged the subpostmasters in a process where they have to apply, and this is what those people have been doing for years. And it’s just not fair to make them do it again. They don’t trust it any more. I’ve got a friend whose auntie has just said: “It’s taken up enough of my life.” She’s not even trying to get the money. She doesn’t want to go through it.You’ve played a lot of real people. Does that come with extra responsibility?\n Oh yeah! One of the most moving days of my career was when we went to Bafta to the screening of Mr Bates vs the Post Office. There was going to be a Q&A. Lots of subpostmasters were there. What if they had turned around and said: “That’s not our story at all and you’ve misrepresented us”? At the same time, the first duty is to the script. Nobody knows the whole truth of any situation.Are you and Jo Hamilton still in touch?\n Yes, she texted me yesterday. We’re both very into our dogs.What’s your opinion of Paula Vennells after making the show?\n I listened to the first day of the inquiry, when Paula was giving evidence. I thought: “Right, this is where she gets exposed.” Then Rishi Sunak resigned, so I was like: “Oh my God, she’s been buried.” Then I thought, she’s so lucky.What’s the most research you’ve done to play a real person?\n When I played Rosemary West, I went to her solicitor and got the transcript of the court case, which the TV company hadn’t managed to do.What’s the secret to playing a villain?\n Don’t deliberately not want to be liked, otherwise you end up twirling a moustache.There’s been a lot of talk about a funding crisis in British drama. Have you felt the effects of that?\n Well, I’ve definitely felt that the things that I’ve been doing have been very stripped back and, you know, there isn’t a lot. At the best of times, there’s a fear of taking risks but now, particularly, people aren’t even pitching things they would have pitched a couple of years ago. There seems to be more push with the scripts I read, making them generic.What TV shows have you been enjoying at the moment?Smoggie Queens. It’s about inclusivity and finding another family than your birth family, and it’s extremely funny as well. There are so many things in it that appeal to everyone, but there are certain jokes that you’d only get if you’re from Middlesbrough.What’s your guilty pleasure TV show?\n Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly Australia. In the whole of Australia, they couldn’t find anyone to train their dogs apart from Graeme Hall, this bloke from Yorkshire! I watch it if I need cheering up.

            "content": "A UK-based advocacy group for Israel has been criticised for suggesting a reduction in obesity resulting from the war in Gaza may increase life expectancy there.The comments by UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), which came amid warnings of impending famine in Gaza, were condemned as “sickening” by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC).UKLFI’s patrons include the former supreme court judge John Dyson, the former Conservative leader Michael Howard and David Pannick KC, who has represented Boris Johnson and the late queen.The remarks were made by Jonathan Turner, the chief executive of UKLFI, in response to a motion due to be debated at the Co-operative Group’s annual general meeting calling for the retailer to stop selling Israeli produce.Urging the Co-operative council to withdraw the motion, Turner criticised the fact that it refers to an estimated death toll of 186,000. In a letter to the Co-operative Group secretary, Turner wrote that it was “totally false and misleading” to cite the figure from a letter published by the Lancet last year, which was a projected figure including indirect casualties.He adds: “The [Lancet] letter also ignored factors that may increase average life expectancy in Gaza, bearing in mind that one of the biggest health issues in Gaza prior to the current war was obesity.”The death toll since Israel began its assault on Gaza after the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel stands at more than 52,000, according to the territory’s health authority. A separate study in the Lancet found life expectancy in Gaza decreased by 34.9 years during the first 12 months of the war, about half (-46.3%) the prewar level of 75.5 years.Ben Jamal, the director of the PSC, said: “As children in the Gaza Strip face the growing risk of starvation, illness and death, the suggestion by the head of UK Lawyers for Israel that they might benefit from weight loss is utterly sickening. These repulsive comments illustrate exactly what it means to be ‘for Israel’ and how low its apologists are prepared to sink in their attempts to justify genocide in Gaza.”Chris Doyle, the director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu), wrote on X that the comments represented “atrocious views”. He said: “How very kind of Israel to put 2.3 million Palestinians on an enforced diet to improve their obesity levels.”A complaint by UKLFI led Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London to remove a display of artwork by Palestinian children in 2023 after the group claimed that it made Jewish patients feel “vulnerable, harassed and victimised”.It has also threatened the UK government with legal action over its decision to suspend about 30 licences for the export of arms to Israel.Turner said: “We first pointed out that the letter published in the Lancet on 20 July 2024, to which the motion evidently referred, did not claim that 186,000 Gazans had died in the current war. It did, however, claim – without foundation – that 186,000 Gaza would be likely to die eventually as a result of the war.“So we pointed out, secondly, that this claim was based on entirely unfounded speculation, which also ignored factors that might result in lengthening the lives of Gazans, given the public health situation existing in Gaza prior to the war, including the extent of obesity. These factors include the possible reduction in the availability of confectionery and cigarettes.“In the context in which they were made, our statements were accurate and objective.”",

            "content": "Senior US and Chinese officials held talks early on Saturday in Geneva in a tentative first step towards defusing a trade war that is disrupting the global economy, according to China’s state-owned news agency and people close to the talks.China’s vice-premier, He Lifeng, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, met after weeks of growing tensions as duties on imports between the world’s two largest economies have risen above 100%.The trade dispute, combined with the decision by the US president, Donald Trump, last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn.Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods “seems right”, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies imposed on Chinese imports. The location of the talks has been kept secret, although a witness saw more than a dozen police cars outside a private residence in a leafy Geneva suburb.Shortly after 9.30 am local time, Bessent, the US trade representative Jamieson Greer and about a dozen US delegates marched through the lobby of the Intercontinental hotel, ignoring journalists’ requests for comment before ducking into waiting cars and speeding off.The Chinese delegation left from another hotel, the President Wilson on the shores of Lake Geneva, with large police contingents escorting the two convoys through the city, blocking all other traffic on their routes. By late morning, Chinese state media confirmed the weekend-long talks had begun.Tariffs imposed on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145%, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245%.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionIn retaliation, China slapped 125% levies on US goods, cementing what appears a near trade embargo between the world’s two largest economies.Beijing has said the US must lift tariffs first and vowed to defend its interests. Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on “de-escalation” and not a “big trade deal”.The head of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said on Friday that she welcomed the talks, calling them a “positive and constructive step toward de-escalation”.",

            "title": "‘Really a mess’: America’s air traffic control system suffering from years of neglect ",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/air-traffic-control-america",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 11:00",
            "content": "Twice in the past two weeks, communications between air traffic controllers and airplanes at Newark Liberty, one of the US’s busiest airports, have failed – leaving controllers unable to communicate with pilots.The outages have, thankfully, only led to massive delays, not disaster. But they have also once again focused a harsh light on the persistent safety problems at US airports, which handle over 50,000 flights a day.As a result of that estimated 90-second communications breakdown on 28 April, many air traffic controllers said they felt traumatized, and thousands of passengers suffered from the hundreds of canceled and delayed flights. A brief radar outage on Friday morning left radar screens black for another 90 seconds – underlining a growing crisis.Political leaders were quick to criticize the rickety state of the air traffic system. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was “really a mess”, while New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, decried “decades of underinvestment” in air traffic control infrastructure, “delays” in modernizing technology, and “inadequate air traffic control staffing”.The transport department’s inspector general has found that at 20 of the nation’s 26 most critical airports, air traffic control staffing falls below the 85% minimum level, with many controllers forced to work 10-hour days and six-day weeks. After the communications breakdown in Newark, several air traffic controllers there was so shaken that they went on “trauma leave”, leaving that airport even more understaffed.The Trump administration moved swiftly to respond after the alarming episode at Newark. On Thursday, Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, unveiled a plan to build a new state-of-the-art system that would overhaul the technology used by the nation’s air traffic controllers. Duffy said his plan would replace “antiquated telecommunications, with new fiber, wireless and satellite technologies at over 4,600 sites”.“A lot of people have said: this problem is too complicated, too expensive, too hard,” Duffy said on Thursday. “But we are blessed to have a president who actually loves to build and knows how to build.”Airlines and the air traffic controllers’ union applauded Duffy’s proposal, but several airline industry experts voiced fears that it would fall short, as have many past plans to fix the system. In a statement, the Modern Skies Coalition, a group of industry associations and experts, said: “We are pleased that the secretary has identified the priorities of what must be done to maintain safety and remain a leader in air navigation services.”The air traffic control system has been through some tough months. In January, a commercial jet collided with an army helicopter near Reagan Washington National airport, killing 67 people in the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001. Trump upset many aviation industry experts and outraged many Americans when he, even before an investigation was begun, rushed to blame the crash on diversity, equity and inclusion.On 1 May, another army helicopter forced two flights to abort their landings at Reagan airport. Newark airport has suffered at least two other similar communications breakdowns since last August. A New York Times investigation in 2023 found that close calls involving commercial airlines occurred, on average, several times each week – with 503 air traffic control lapses occurring in the 12 months before 30 September 2023.For some these latests issues are part of a much older story. “The system’s staffing problems started when Ronald Reagan fired over 10,000 air traffic controllers,” after they went on strike in 1981, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.“And those problems were worsened by his pushing the hatred of government and the dismantling of government. That’s what’s put us on the track to where we are today. There were budget cuts and tax cuts for the rich, and all that stopped us from doing the infrastructure projects and hiring and training that we needed to have a stable system.”The nation’s air navigation system has just under 10,800 certified controllers, but their union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, says there needs to be more than 14,300, the number recommended by an arm of the FAA, called the Collaborative Resource Workgroup. There are over 2,000 controllers in training, and the union has urged the Trump administration to increase the number in the pipeline. Training usually takes 18 to 24 months, and getting up to speed to work at the most demanding airports such as JFK and Newark can take more than three years.“There is a shortage of controllers nationwide, but not to the degree it’s occurring at Newark,” said Jeff Guzzetti, an industry consultant who was an investigator for the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.“There’s been a shortage of controllers for years, if not decades. That shortage was exaggerated by Covid; they couldn’t conduct training for new controllers. Beyond that, they’ve always had a problem finding the right people with the right skills to control traffic and to get people to pass the course work at the training academy and then to get them up to speed.”Many trainees drop out and don’t pass their exams, and many controllers don’t stay in the job because it is so stressful. In recent years, the number of controllers has been relatively flat. The total has declined by 10% since 2012 due to retirements and trainees failing to finish their requirements.“It’s not only the shortage of air traffic controllers. It’s antiquated facilities and equipment and software,” Guzzetti said. Many facilities still rely on floppy disks and copper wire.He said: “It’s all coming to a head now in New York and Newark. Newark has always been the worst in terms of air traffic staffing and modernizing its equipment.”Last September, the Government Accountability Office said the FAA needed to take “urgent action” to deal with its antiquated air traffic control systems. It said 51 of the FAA’s 138 air traffic control systems were unsustainable.On Thursday, Duffy did not say what his modernization plan would cost. The House transportation and infrastructure committee says it would cost $12.5bn to overhaul the air traffic control system, but Duffy says his plan would cost more than that. “Decades of neglect have left us with an outdated system that is showing its age,” he said. “Building this new system is an economic and national security necessity.”On May 1, Duffy announced a related plan filled with incentives that he said would “supercharge the air traffic controller work force.” It includes $5,000 bonuses to new hires who successfully finish the initial training.Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University who wrote a book about the 1981 air traffic controllers’ strike, said that ever since Reagan fired 11,345 striking controllers, “the system has been out of sync”.“The natural rhythm of the system broke down and we never fully recovered,” he said. “We’ve improved over time, but the FAA still has grave difficulty staffing facilities.”McCartin added: “[Elon Musk’s] Doge has made things only worse. The entire system that federal employees operate under has been terribly destabilized. The FAA exists in a world where this entire project of the federal government is teetering.”Robert W Mann Jr, an aviation industry analyst, said that for 40 years there have been FAA reauthorizations approved by Congress, but they haven’t fixed the problems. “Unless you do it right, it doesn’t make a difference what you spend,” he said. “You won’t have solved the root causes.”Nonetheless, Mann said he remained confident about airline safety. He said: “There’s a primacy in this business. Whether you’re working at airlines or the FAA, safety is the first thing.”Mann said that days when an airport faces severe understaffing of air traffic controllers or a crush of airplanes eager to take off as bad weather lifts, there will often be delays to ensure safety. “I’m not worried about safety,” Mann said, “but I might be worried that my flight will be four hours’ late.”Nelson, the flight attendants’ president, said that the US should be thankful to air traffic controllers because their job is so hard, stressful and important. “They should be commended for working in a system that’s crumbling,” she said. “They’re the ones we all need to applaud right now. They’re like the nurses during Covid, when everyone came out at 6 o’clock to bang pots and pans.”A big question now is whether Congress will approve the money for Duffy’s ambitious modernization plan. Nelson said: “I hate to say we’re a canary in the coalmine, but those of us in the airline industry have known for a long time that a lot of this [the air traffic control equipment] has been a problem. What happened in Newark is a sign of what will come in other airports if we don’t get the budget we need.”",

            "content": "On the day of the last general election, my mother rose at 5am to head to the polling station. With any kind of voting, she volunteers her days off from work to help out with the ballots. Although she can’t vote in this country.My mother feels patriotic about her country of origin, Italy, but her home has been England for the past 15 years. She has a British partner, holds legal residence in the UK, and has been paying British taxes as long as she has been here. She never felt fully accepted by people in this country. She is often talked down to because of her accent, although her English is proficient. She also finds some difficulty with everyday things, such as worrying about being understood by her manager or applying for pension assistance – struggling with everything from British humour, to the country’s administration. And she still feels that, as an immigrant, she needs to prove something.At first a teacher for young children, now a bus driver, she always did jobs that tied her to the local community, that had some sort of service element. She constantly feels that she must give back, and constantly tells me “you must always be grateful”.She took to the most British of traits since arriving here, which is to be overly polite and say “thank you” for small favours. If someone at a public office asks her to repeat herself, because of her strong accent, she will still smile and thank them for their work.Her time in England feels like a debt, a favour she has to return. No moment served as a greater reminder of this feeling than my eviction from a flat by my landlords. Although they threatened to throw a vase at my head, my mother’s words of advice were to “leave a thankyou gift”. It seems that her need to be more grateful than necessary may even eclipse her better judgment.She never felt this way before we left our home country. This need she has to work harder than others, to do more, feel at odds with how people like her are treated. It’s easy for a daughter that’s fully integrated to misunderstand her mother’s devotion to her new country, but I see how out of place she feels in everyday life. Looking at her life, it is easy to feel resentful that she has to go so far to prove herself worthy of occupying space, when she already sufficiently contributes to a society that is lucky to have her.In the past few years, she spent her days off working at the Red Cross, or determinedly marching from door to door in assistance of the 2021 government census. When people would shut the door in her face, she would effuse her dutiful sense of democratic appreciation for a country in which she is one of about five million people unable to vote because of their immigration status.Her visits home to Italy have been increasing in the last few years. And although we have our fair share of hostility towards immigrants over there, the anti-immigration riots seen last August across 27 towns and cities all over England and Northern Ireland brought sudden fear to the foreign-born community.After the hate riots, she attended her first anti-racism protest. Afterwards, a colleague stopped talking to her in bigoted disagreement, but my mother still says hello with a smile. Although she perseveres with perennial gratitude, she has grown to better understand the British stance on her residence here – which broadens her perception of herself as a guest that must work for her stay.Since Brexit, the rise of Reform UK and the continuous use of anti-immigrant rhetoric in news and politics spells out to people like my mother that they’re not wanted here. Just this week, the government trailed the idea of restricting visa applications from certain countries, and every time Keir Starmer announces an immigration policy it’s framed as tough or a “crack down”, speaking to the overarching national sentiment that immigrants aren’t welcome. According to a YouGov poll published last month, 70% of Britons think that immigration has been too high in the last 10 years.The government’s use of demonising language towards migrants has been hurtful to people like my mother, especially since it is broadly unfounded. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the UK experiences similar levels of migration compared to other high-income countries, such as France and the US.I’m frightened of the increased prevalence of politicians such as Nigel Farage, and of Reform’s successes at last week’s local elections and the Runcorn and Helsby byelection. It’s worrying that normalised extreme-right discourse is infusing government policy, building on the legacy of the Conservative party’s hostile environment for immigrants.People like my mother have started to leave the UK. The privilege of having an EU passport has seen many desert their adopted country after Brexit and its accompanying hostility.

She is still extremely grateful for everything that the UK has given her.

It has markets, museums and galleries; we love to just wander around, taking in the sights,” she says. “You’re also spoiled for choice when it comes to food; we had some incredible chicken satay for lunch.

            "title": "Is Russia co-opting US far-right groups to attack western democracies?",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/us-far-right-groups-russia-links",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 11:00",
            "content": "A former Pentagon contractor works with secretive sections of US special forces, then ups and moves to Russia. He gets married, radicalizes and starts popping up on Telegram channels as the leader of a neo-Nazi terrorist group recruiting Americans.Soon, allegations swirl that he is a Russian spy.While this sounds like something Tom Clancy would write, it is reality: Rinaldo Nazzaro, better known as the leader of the Base, once worked in drone targeting with the US Special Operations Command in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recently, the Guardian revealed allegations from inside the Base that he was long suspected of working with the FSB, one of Russia’s main intelligence services.If true, the startling revelation about Nazzaro fits into the Kremlin’s well-documented global mission of co-opting far-right and criminal organizations to carry out attacks on western democracies.That mission is very much alive and well.“The Kremlin plays the long game and is highly invested in developing assets that can be used to wreak havoc in the west,” said Colin Clarke, a geopolitics expert and director of research at the Soufan Center who has closely followed Russia’s flurry of sabotage operations around the world. “Russian intelligence services are using far-right terror groups to their advantage.”Since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, world governments have been on edge: without the unlimited military resources it had during the cold war era, the Kremlin has turned to the tactics of hybrid warfare to undermine its enemies and neighbors. A spate of suspected covert assassinations, arsons and sabotage in the west have followed.“Russia has also been accused of funding far-right political parties, which can serve as a Trojan horse of sorts for more nefarious operations,” said Clarke.Part of this global mission has included using disinformation to stoke xenophobic online sentiments in Britain and elsewhere. Laundering cash payments to far-right political parties across Europe through dodgy media outlets has also become a mainstay in the Kremlin playbook.But in some other cases, using connections through its globally designated terror group the Russian Imperial Movement (RIM), the Kremlin has provided on-the-ground paramilitary training to Swedish extremists outside their country and then sent them back. In another separate incident, Russia was suspected of having a hand in getting Polish militants to attempt a false flag attack in Ukraine.“Since Moscow can be strategic when it comes to state-sponsored terrorism, the Kremlin may be cultivating relationships with these groups as a form of strategic depth, saving them for a rainy day so to speak,” Clarke explained, referring to the Base. “In some ways, it’s similar to how countries like Iran and Pakistan maintain linkages with terrorist groups.”In October, the head of the UK’s domestic intelligence service, MI5, accused Russian agents of being behind “actions conducted with increasing recklessness” on European and British soil.Stateside, there is not the same extensive evidence of similar direct action via Kremlin assets using far-right extremist groups – but there has been no shortage of suspicions.“That was a joke going around and we never confirmed it, but you tell me,” said Scott Payne, a former FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Base, about Nazzaro’s links to Russian handlers.“You got a guy who is a citizen, graduated from Villanova, [worked] somewhere in the army, flipped, radicalized, and then moved to St Petersburg, Russia, and has a Russian wife and kids.”Payne, who recently released the memoir Code Name: Pale Horse about his experiences in the Base and other assignments with the far right as a bureau agent, explained that Nazzaro set off alarm bells both inside his group and the FBI.“I didn’t confirm it, but I was told they had tracked a million dollars going through his account, but all he was doing was supposed to be teaching English?” Payne said. “It goes with the [modus operandi], right? If you’re talking about foreign influence [operations].”Nazzaro, who appeared in a widely panned interview on Russian state television in 2020 denying that he was an agent of their government, has roundly denied any claims he has nefarious government backers. \n “The news media has recently, once again, dragged out the old and tired accusation of me being a government agent,” Nazzaro said in a Telegram statement released in late April. “I have never had contact with Russian security services.”But in April, the Base unveiled a Ukrainian cell offering operatives money for assassinating politicians in the country or attacking police and military targets. Backlash followed, with Ukrainian and American far-right Telegram accounts accusing Nazzaro of being a spy in league with Russia. It also coincided with reports that Russia was enhancing its recruitment of Ukrainian locals, whom it is sending on suicide missions in the Kherson region.“How does the Base have money for so [many] bots and rewards for actions?” speculated one anti-Nazzaro user affiliated with the Base on Telegram. “I wonder who funds them.”Sources inside the US intelligence community had previously said there were suspicions Nazzaro was working for or being financed by Russian security services. At one point, given his residence in St Petersburg, the former nerve center of the infamous mercenary outfit the Wagner Group, theories arose that he could be working with it. For a time, Wagner had enjoyed a close relationship with the RIM and other neo-Nazi groups as it was ambitiously looking to partner with foreign elements and increase its global reach.Clarke noted that the news that Nazzaro was purportedly acting under the direction of the Kremlin was not shocking to analysts in or outside government.“If this is true, it will be interesting to see how Nazzaro was recruited,” he said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Russia is maintaining relationships with far-right groups throughout the globe, from Latin America to eastern Europe and beyond.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 10:41",
            "content": "Patricia Clarkson, who portrays late equal pay activist Lilly Ledbetter in a biopic released this week, has a wish.The Oscar-nominated actor hopes her fellow American women collectively withhold sex from their partners – especially men in power – if the second Trump administration’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives ever takes aim at the gains won by the subject of her new film.“Do not go after this – do not because there will be a Lysistrata moment,” she told the Guardian in an interview recently, alluding to the ancient Greek comedy about women resolving to abstain from sex to compel the men in their nation to stop warring and sign a peace treaty. “We will put chastity belts back on.”Clarkson is only the latest in a long lineage to float the idea of a sex strike as a protest tactic. Nonetheless, what sets the Easy A and Sharp Objects star’s admonition and potential call to action apart is that it comes as her leading role in Lilly coincides with the first months of a second Donald Trump presidency marked in large part by the rollback of policies meant to widen the professional opportunities of historically underrepresented groups.Directed by Rachel Feldman, Lilly dramatizes the struggles endured by a working-class mother from Alabama who began working at the tire manufacturer Goodyear in 1979 before becoming its only female supervisor and eventually realizing she was paid substantially less than her male colleagues, including much less experienced ones.She sued and at one point had been awarded nearly $4m in damages and backpay. But, in 2007, the US supreme court ruled that she had waited too long to sue, preventing her from ever collecting her award.Ultimately, with lobbying from Ledbetter and supporters that she picked up while pursuing her lawsuit, Congress enacted legislation early in Barack Obama’s presidency that afforded workers greater latitude to sue their employers over unequal and discriminatory pay.The New Orleans-born Clarkson said she did not get to meet Ledbetter before her death at age 86 in October. So Clarkson said she largely drew inspiration for her portrayal of the resolute Ledbetter from her mother, Jacquelyn “Jackie” Brechtel Clarkson, who served several terms as a Democratic member of New Orleans’s city council and Louisiana’s state legislature during a political career regarded as legendary in their home town.She marveled at how her mother, who died at age 88 about four months before Ledbetter, never compromised raising five daughters – “all working women” – while facing down countless intense political battles.“They had similar DNA in ways that came to me as I was doing these scenes,” Clarkson said.To say the least, the political climate depicted in Lilly through Clarkson’s acting as well as through archival footage of prominent liberal American political figures who philosophically aligned themselves with her has changed seismically.In between Trump presidencies, the US supreme court eliminated the federal abortion rights established by Roe v Wade, a staggering blow to women’s reproductive rights.Trump has then spent his second presidency pushing his government to withhold funds from institutions which adhere to DEI practices that took hold nationally after the Minneapolis police’s murder of George Floyd in 2020.Less than two weeks before Lilly’s theatrical release, Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, announced his intent to eliminate a program meant to promote women’s contributions and safety in global conflict zones. The announcement raised eyebrows given that it was implemented during Trump’s first presidency and had drawn a ringing endorsement from his daughter, Ivanka.Clarkson made it a point to deliver an impassioned defense of DEI measures in general, urging Americans to stay informed about the topic despite the other fights being stoked by Trump’s second presidency.“When we work with people of every race, creed, color, sexual preference – that’s the best part of this world we live in,” Clarkson said. “I refuse to live in the world” demonizing that concept.Speaking to the Guardian after accepting the New Orleans Film Society’s Celluloid Hero Award and hosting a local screening of Lilly in early April, Clarkson said she honestly could not envision the Trump administration turning its crosshairs on the equal pay progress that has become synonymous with Ledbetter.“Equal pay is not – it’s not a political issue,” Clarkson said. “It’s a human rights issue.Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotion“Wherever you live across this great country, whether you are Black or white or brown or young or old or whatever you are, Republican or Democrat – when women make equal pay, everybody wins.”Yet the New York City resident also fears nothing is truly off the table during a second Trump presidency that has already shattered political norms many could not imagine being vulnerable. And if the administration dares to test something as drastic as re-implementing a system where pay is based on gender, she said she hoped the public mounts commensurate resistance – from Ivanka herself trying to talk some sense into her father to a women’s sex strike if necessary.“How is it cool for anyone to want their spouse, the love of their life, to be paid less, and you’re still going to ask for sex?” said Clarkson, who once attained digital virality with an appearance in the music video to the Lonely Island song Mother Lover, an irreverent ballad of sorts to desirable moms. “I say, ‘Honey, there must be another bedroom I’m sleeping in.’”Clarkson was quick to point out that she has faith in the willingness of men to step up in the event that Ledbetter’s achievements are ever directly threatened. By way of evidence, Clarkson said she was glad Lilly spent a decent amount of its 93-minute run time exploring how Ledbetter’s husband of 52 years, Charles, steadily supported her professional goals and activism despite the backlash they generated for the couple and their two children.The decorated US army veteran, played by John Benjamin Hickey, never sought to persuade her to settle for less than she believed that she deserved in hopes of easing some of the pressure. He instead remained in her corner until his death at 73 in 2008, a little more than a month before the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act for which his beloved battled so hard became the first piece of legislation Obama signed as president.Clarkson said Charles Ledbetter’s unquestioning devotion to Lilly reminded her of the love the actor’s mother shared with her father, Arthur Alexander “Buzz” Clarkson Jr, a former medical school administrator to whom Jackie was married for more than 70 years.“My father wanted my mother to run this city,” Clarkson said while seated in the living room of an 18th-floor suite in downtown New Orleans’s Windsor Court hotel. “My father wanted my mother to make this city better.“Lilly’s husband wanted her to succeed. Charles … got caught up in her journey in realizing what she was sacrificing and the injustice of not being paid” adequately for the time she dedicated to making ends meet for her family.Clarkson has previously said that she chose to be unmarried and not have children. But she said she admired how her father and Charles Ledbetter were “kick-ass husbands who loved every single moment of their [wives’] lives”. And it positioned the women whom each of those men loved to thrive in the face of political adversity, providing an example Clarkson said she hopes more American spouses – especially husbands – emulate.As Clarkson put it: “These remarkable men stood by these women. And they wanted them.”Lilly is out in US cinemas now with a UK date to be announced",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk has been voted the UK’s favourite second world war film, beating classics such as The Dam Busters and The Bridge on the River Kwai.The 2017 film, starring Harry Styles, Cillian Murphy and Barry Keoghan, portrays the 1940 evacuation of more than 330,000 Allied troops from the French coast.Saving Private Ryan (1998) placed second, followed by The Great Escape (1963) in third, with The Dam Busters (1955) and Battle of Britain (1969) completing the top five.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Saving Private Ryan follows a special US detachment searching for a missing soldier after the Normandy invasion. The Great Escape tells the story of the attempt by a group of Allied prisoners to escape a Nazi camp.The poll, conducted by Deltapoll for the War Movie Theatre podcast, pitted modern war films against older movies, considered classic by many fans. Other entries in the top 10 included The Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far, Pearl Harbor and Schindler’s List.The journalist and author Robert Hutton, co-host of the War Movie Theatre podcast with fellow journalist Duncan Weldon, said: “Cinema has always been looking for great stories, and war provides everything, heroism, moral conflict, adventure, romance.“Even as the second world war was being fought, it was inspiring some of the greatest films of the last century, such as In Which We Serve or Went the Day Well?, which deliver moments of human drama and comedy as well as action.“Afterwards, it became a way for us to tell ourselves stories about what had happened, and then a generation later, with Saving Private Ryan, it became a way to commemorate.”On Dunkirk topping the list, Hutton said: “It’s not surprising that Dunkirk is top of the list, it’s the most successful war movie of the last decade. But it’s noteworthy that half the list is from the golden era of war movies in the 50s and 60s. Four of them were made within eight years of each other.“I’m a little sad that John Mills, who seemed to be permanently in uniform on Sunday afternoon TV in my childhood, doesn’t get a film in this list.“And I’d have liked to see at least one of the great Alistair MacLean commando movies, Where Eagles Dare or The Guns of Navarone, in there. But mainly I’m appalled to see Pearl Harbor on the list, which ought to be a war crime.”The full top 10 list, according to the War Movie Theatre podcast poll, was as follows:Dunkirk (2017)Saving Private Ryan (1998)The Great Escape (1963)The Dam Busters (1955)Battle of Britain (1969)The Longest Day (1962)A Bridge Too Far (1977)Pearl Harbor (2001)Schindler’s List (1993)The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)",

            "content": "Virat Kohli is set to deliver another blow to India’s plans for their imminent tour of England by indicating he wants to retire from Test cricket just days after Rohit Sharma’s decision to stand down, according to reports.Indian media is reporting that the 36-year-old has told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) that he no longer wishes to play the longest format of the game. The news comes amid rising tensions border with Pakistan. The Indian Premier League is on a one-week pause, while the Pakistan Super League has also been suspended.India’s selectors now face potentially having to pick a competitive touring party after losing two of their leading players – both former Test captains – when they meet in the coming days before next month’s five-Test series. India are set to face Ben Stokes’s team at Headingley from 20 June and will go on to end the series at the Oval from 31 July. Kohli averages 33.21 in 17 Tests in England with two centuries.According to reports in India, the Indian cricket board is urging Kohli to row back on his decision. A source told the Indian Express: “He has made up his mind and has informed the board that he is moving on from Test cricket. The BCCI has urged him to rethink as the crucial England tour is coming up. He is yet to revert on the request.”Should Kohli not change his mind, India will have to shore up a callow middle order and lean more heavily on the top-order batters KL Rahul, Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal, plus Rishabh Pant at five.The loss of two experienced and charismatic leaders would certainly trouble India’s selectors. Kohli captained India at Test level from December 2014 until he was succeed by Rohit in February 2022. It is believed Gill, the the vice-captain of the one-day international team, is the leading candidate to succeed Rohit.Kohli’s average has tailed off in the past five years. In 123 Tests for India, he has scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85. For India’s last Test series, against Australia, he averaged 23.75 in five Tests and later hinted that his disappointment at his declining performance marked a watershed in his international career. “I might not have an Australia tour again in me in four years’ time,” he said in March.“Because I got a good score in the first Test. I thought: ‘Right, let’s go. There’s going to be another big series for me.’ It doesn’t turn out that way. For me, it’s just about the acceptance of: ‘OK fine, this is what happened.’ I’m going to be honest with myself. Where do I want to go? What are my energy levels like?’”Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotionKohli retired from T20 internationals following India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies last year but his recent form in the IPL has been impressive, scoring 505 runs in 11 matches, including three fifties, at a strike rate of 143.46 for Royal Challengers Bengaluru. He stands fourth in India’s all-time list of Test run scorers, with 30 centuries and a highest total of 254 not out against South Africa in 2019.His playing stats aside, Kohli’s loss to the Test side, as a one of the world’s greats, would be keenly felt. His standing in the dressing room earned him the nickname “Captain Fearless”. His record as skipper is unmatched: Kohli’s media profile – he has 67.8 million followers on X – draws more attention than any other cricketer. As one of his other nicknames suggests, King Kohli wears the crown.With Kohli as skipper, India won 40 of those 68 Tests, a winning percentage of 58.82. He led India to their first-ever series win on Australian soil during the 2018-19 tour, leading from the front as an outstanding opener, setting new standards of fitness and competitiveness, and forging India into a Test side to be reckoned with at home and overseas. Last year, he pulled out of the first two of India’s five Tests against England on home soil for personal reasons.",

It has also pledged to invest more funding to stop high-risk perpetrators through electronic monitoring.But Moody said ministers and leaders needed to sit down with frontline services to figure out what works.“All the safety nets have holes in them and the funding barely even hits the sides,” she said.

            "content": "I’m sitting at my computer when a link refuses to load, leaving me with a white screen. I click on several of the 37 other windows I have open. None of them loads. I go and find my wife in front of her computer.“Are you having trouble with the internet?” I say.“Why yes,” she says. “I am.” She doesn’t seem as put out by the situation as I am.I go and look at the wifi router, which is pulsing with an eerie blue light – a sign that all is not well. I unplug it briefly, and let it reset itself. After shifting through many different shades, the blue light returns.“That ain’t good,” I say.It’s not good because my internet provider’s customer service is rated among the worst in the nation. If the problem proves to be their fault, I am in for a difficult day, or days.Also, I have work to do. I cannot afford to get obsessed with my lack of internet. My wife appears behind me, holding a shopping bag.“Where are you going?” I say.“Out,” she says.“You mean you’re leaving me here to deal with this?” I say.“Yes,” she says. “I am.”Using my phone, I access my internet provider’s unloved troubleshooting guide. First, it checks to see if I have paid my bill.“Typical,” I say.The troubleshooter then checks for outages in my postcode. Then it shows me illustrations of wifi routers flashing different colours, and asks me to choose. I click on blue, only to look up and see the box is now flashing red.The procedure ends with the problem unresolved, and the opportunity to book a visit from an engineer. The first available slot is for the following morning. This seems rash – the internet has been down for 20 minutes – but there is no less rash option, so I click.When I look up again, the box is giving off a steady white light.“Are you kidding?” I say.My wife returns an hour later to find me still hovering over the router.“There was a man out there messing with the junction box,” she says.“Where?” I say. “What kind of man?”“A human man,” she says.“I mean, like a cable engineer, or a vandal?”“He said he was installing the wifi for next door,” she says. “I asked him if he had anything to do with ours going down, and he said no.”“He would,” I say.It is possible to access the internet by linking my laptop to my phone, but it’s deeply unsatisfactory. That evening I try to tell my wife what a frustrating day I’ve had, but she refuses to engage with the technical details that bring the story to life.“Periodically the wifi would come back on,” I say. “Just long enough to reconnect to everything and break the 5G link,” I say.“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” she says, sitting down and grabbing the TV remote. The television displays a blank blue screen with a box in the middle saying No Signal.“Wait, does this mean we can’t watch telly?” my wife says.“I’m afraid so,” I say.“Do something!” she says.The next morning I’m in the kitchen waiting for the engineers. At 9am the internet starts working, like a rash clearing up on the morning of your GP appointment. At 9.15 the signal quits again, much to my relief. At 10 I check to see if my time slot has narrowed. I receive a message that says “You do not have an engineer appointment.”“What?” I say.“Would you like to book an appointment?” the message says.“This is why you are the most hated service provider in the entire …”The doorbell rings. I open the door to find two uniformed engineers on the step.“This is weird,” I say.“Is it?” says one.“Come in,” I say.The two men are unfailingly polite and helpful. They quickly trace the problem to outside. One of them shows me the spot where the door between the front and back gardens has rubbed the insulation off the cable.“So it’s my fault,” I say. He smiles.“We can fix that for you no problem,” he says. And they do, in about half an hour. One of them gives me his mobile number, in case I encounter any difficulties while they’re working in the area.“It was amazing,” I tell my wife later. “They even put these slippers on in the house to protect the floors.”“It’s enough to restore your faith in humanity,” she says.I think: steady on.",

            "content": "India and Pakistan have accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against major military targets, the most significant escalation so far in the brewing conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.On Saturday, India accused Pakistan of launching strikes on dozens of airbases and military headquarters across north India, using long-range weapons, drones and fighter aircraft. The accusations came a few hours after Pakistan said India had fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting three of Pakistan’s most important military bases early on Saturday morning.Shortly afterwards, Pakistan officials confirmed they had begun their counter-attack against India, under the name Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, a phrase from the Qur’an roughly translating to “wall of lead”.The claims of missile attacks on military targets deep inside India and Pakistan were seen as a worrying escalation in hostilities, bringing the two countries the closest they have been to war in decades.According to the Indian army spokesperson Col Sofiya Qureshi, Pakistan struck first on Saturday. At a press conference, the Indian army accused Pakistan of attacking 26 sites in India, including the Pathankot military airfield in Punjab, Srinagar airport and Udhampur air force base in Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as “deplorable and cowardly” attacks on civilian infrastructure.Qureshi said the “Indian Armed Forces successfully neutralised these threats” but added that some damage was done to equipment and personnel at four airbases. The foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said claims by Pakistani media that airbases and advanced weapons systems had been destroyed in the strikes were “heavy on lies, misinformation and propaganda”.The Indian army alleged its attack on Pakistan’s military bases on Saturday was in retaliation for high-speed missiles fired at several air bases in Punjab at around 2am. “In a swift and calibrated response, Indian Armed Forces carried out precision attacks only on identified military targets,” said Qureshi.In the hours after the strikes, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, told local media that if India stopped here “we will consider to stop here” and that the ball for de-escalation was in India’s court. India also said it was committed to “non-escalation” provided the Pakistan side reciprocated.However, the Indian army claimed Pakistan was still mobilising its troops, in what they regarded as further aggression. “Pakistan military has been observed to be moving their troops into forward areas, indicating offensive intent to further escalate the situation,” said Qureshi.Pakistan’s version of events was different to that of India. In an address broadcast on state TV at around 3.30am, the military spokesperson Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry claimed India had struck first, using fighter jets to fire surface-to-air missiles at Nur Khan, Murid and Shorkot military bases. He said the “majority” of India’s missiles were intercepted by air defence systems.Nur Khan airbase is in Rawalpindi, where the military has its headquarters, and is around 6 miles from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. In the aftermath of the strikes, Pakistan shut down its air space.The strike on Nur Khan caused mass panic in the densely populated area. Video from the scene shared on social media showed flames and smoke billowing into the night sky, with residents running into the streets. “There was a loud explosion which woke everyone up. It was so scary, everyone is still in a panic,” said one resident living nearby.Chaudhry called the strikes “blatant acts of aggression by India” and said they were “part of a larger sinister plan to push the region and beyond into havoc”. Just over an hour later, Pakistan declared it had begun its counter-attack on military sites in India.Speaking after the attacks, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said it was premature to give any statements on de-escalation but confirmed international mediation efforts were under way.“Things are in the pipeline and contacts have been established.” he told the Guardian. “There is no conclusive statement to be given yet. But I can confirm that the US and Saudi Arabia are playing a crucial role as interlocutors. The secretary of state made a call today to Pakistan’s military chief, and the Saudi state minister for foreign affairs is in town.”He added: “We can’t trust the Indians for talks and de-escalation. If interlocutors and our common friends and credible countries such as Saudi Arabia and the US step in and play a crucial role, we have no issue to de-escalate. We did not start it. We just responded to the Indian military aggression.”The fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which they blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday.In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.In the aftermath of Pakistan’s strikes, tensions remained high across India. Heavy shelling and gunfire were reported overnight across the Line of Control, the heavily militarised, de facto border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan, with several civilians killed.In India, cities and districts in Punjab, Haryana and across Indian-administered Kashmir were put on red alert, with residents told to remain indoors and blackout orders enforced.The Indian military said it had actively begun large-scale mobilisation of additional forces to the border and had activated its reserve Territorial Army to ensure full operational strength.The US state department confirmed that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had spoken to Pakistan’s army chief, Gen Asim Munir, and India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, early on Saturday morning. Rubio called for a de-escalation and “offered US assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts”, a state department spokesperson said.",

            "content": "There are three kinds of family, muses the novelist and poet Ocean Vuong. There’s the nuclear family, “which often we talk about as the central tenet of American life”. There’s the chosen family, “the pushback”, the community and friendships built by people who have been rejected by their parents, often because of their sexuality or gender identity. And then there’s the family we talk about much less frequently, but spend most of our waking hours within – our colleagues, or what Vuong describes as “the circumstantial family around labour”.Vuong’s forthcoming second novel, The Emperor of Gladness, encompasses them all. There’s its 19-year‑old hero Hai’s relationship with his mother, a poor Vietnamese immigrant who believes that he has fulfilled her desperate aspirations for him by going to university, when he has actually gone to rehab. (Vuong, who also struggled with drug addiction, didn’t dare tell his mother when he dropped out of a marketing course at Pace University in New York, before getting on to the English literature course at Brooklyn College that set the course for his life as a writer.) The core of the book is Hai’s relationship with Grazina, an elderly widow from Lithuania who has dementia, and who takes him in when she sees him about to throw himself off a bridge in despair. Then there are the eccentric and richly drawn staff members of HomeMarket, the fast food restaurant in which Hai works, with its manager who is an aspiring wrestler, and customers ranging from the snotty and entitled to the homeless and desperate.Talking in London shortly after Trump’s inauguration, looking every inch the left-field literary lion in a tweed coat, jagged haircut and dangly earring, Vuong says that it’s the special circumstances of our work relationships that make the kind of intimate revelations he depicts in the book possible: “The labour, the anonymity, the long eight-hour shift being this randomised, arbitrary coalescence of people.” He knows what he’s talking about as he used to work in two fast food restaurants in his home town of East Hartford, Connecticut, where he and his mother settled after fleeing Vietnam when Vuong was two, then spending eight months in a refugee camp in the Philippines.In the restaurants, “I would hear conversations from my co-workers that would blow my mind as a 19-year‑old,” remembers the author, who is now 36. “These private confessions. I’ll always remember I was cleaning the walk-in freezer with one man, about 50. We had our backs to each other, and he said: ‘I can’t tell my wife this; it would kill her. I have three sons, but I’ve realised that I only love one of them.’ If I heard that now, I would probably weep, right? He was trying to give me something, I realise. But at the time I was just like: ‘What is going on?’”The Emperor of Gladness is a slice of American working-class life that depicts the emotions of its protagonists with a sensitivity and lusciousness familiar to readers of Vuong’s first novel, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous. Published in 2019, that book has sold 500,000 copies in the UK, and 1m copies globally after being printed in 40 languages, making Vuong a literary superstar. As with The Emperor of Gladness, it drew on his own experiences: like its protagonist, Vuong worked illegally in a tobacco farm, while his mother, Lê Kim Hông, had a job in a nail salon. Vuong believes that the chemicals she was exposed to were responsible for her death from breast cancer aged 51.Vuong’s first-hand experience of hardship animates his writing, which is full of vivid insights into the way the poor in America struggle to survive. The Emperor of Gladness acutely depicts the deceptions inherent in this tough existence, from the “home cooking” at the fast food restaurant, which is actually pre-cooked off‑site and reheated, to Hai’s heartbreaking lies to his mother. “Often, perhaps through theology, we see deception as corrupt,” Vuong says. “But in my life, and what I’m trying to explore in this book is: what is benevolent deception? All these people deceive each other, but they’re trying to help each other, and also trying to get something from each other. We often see folks who are impoverished as passive victims, but it takes an incredible amount of creativity and innovation to survive in the brutal economics of America.”He is also very attuned to what he calls “chameleonising”, or code-switching, which he says is something that the working poor do all the time. “Growing up in the nail salon answering the phones for my mom, I got to see how people talked, how women would chit-chat with their husbands in the waiting area. And then their husbands would leave, and their voices would change when they spoke to each other. I just thought it was so fascinating.”Vuong’s mother lived long enough to see his early literary success. He has been showered with accolades, including the MacArthur fellowship (AKA the “genius grant”) and TS Eliot prize, and has an army of readers including many young fans. Director Luca Guadignino depicted the queer, gender-questioning teenagers in his 2020 TV series We Are Who We Are reading Vuong’s poetry collection Night Sky With Exit Wounds, and he was interviewed on a podcast by an audibly overawed Sam Smith. Björk loved his work so much that she wrote to his agent asking to meet him, and the pair have since become friends, not least because when they met late in 2019, Vuong’s mother would die within a month, while Björk was grieving for her own mother, who had died six months before. She gives him advice on dealing with fame, which he describes as “one of my biggest challenges”.When he’s not teaching in New York (he is professor in modern poetry and poetics at New York University), Vuong lives in a 1780s farmhouse in rural Massachusetts with his younger brother, who he took in after their mother’s death, and his long-term partner, lawyer Peter Bienkowski. “I have two dogs sitting by a fire; our friends are local country doctors and farmers,” the author says. “And then I have to do publicity or something, and there’s an audience of a thousand people in an auditorium. I don’t think I’m ever comfortable with it because it gets very parasocial. People feel like they know me. But Björk told me I was doing it right, and to keep it small.” Prizes, he says, “can change your life. They’re economic windfalls” – the MacArthur Grant is worth $625,000 – “but they’re given to the past. They’re not an assessment of who you are.”His Zen Buddhism also comes into play: Vuong talks about the principle of the eight winds, including prosperity, decline, disgrace, honour, praise, censure, suffering and pleasure. “If you don’t have a strong sense of who you are that roots you, then you’re at the mercy of the winds and you’ll be blown over. But that was a practice I did way before I became an author.”Vuong’s attitude to fame may be low key, but his approach to writing is not: The Emperor of Gladness is more ambitious and larger in scope than anything he has attempted before. It contains moments of almost unbearable poignancy, not to mention a nightmarish chapter set in an abattoir (mistreatment of animals, he believes, is “the staging ground for the violence that we enact on each other”), but it has great warmth, excursions into areas of popular culture not usually explored by literary fiction (hip-hop, civil-war tourism and yes, wrestling) and even some jokes. “I couldn’t have written this book as a debut,” Vuong says. “I didn’t have the chops. I wanted to use humour – and humour is very hard. If On Earth is the artist’s statement, the kind of philosophical treatise of what I wanted to do, then Emperor is me trying to walk the walk. Walking the walk is harder than talking the talk.”Sign up to BookmarksDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories. Literary delights delivered direct to youafter newsletter promotionVuong, who could not read or write until he was 11 (he suspects that dyslexia ran in his family), says that DH Lawrence was one inspiration for The Emperor of Gladness, which is “about the same size as Sons and Lovers”, deals with working-class anxiety, and doesn’t offer some rags-to-riches-style escape from the grind of poverty. “Lawrence just said no, there’s going to be no improvement; this whole cycle will stay within this place. We will live, we will talk about life and we’ll talk about death here. I think that was quite radical.”Like Lawrence’s Nottinghamshire, Vuong’s Connecticut is a far cry from the state’s usual public face. “When I was 20 and living in New York, people would say that Connecticut was the place where posh people with sweaters tied over their necks would live, and I said: ‘I don’t know that part,’” Vuong explains. “What I saw was a post-industrial world of immigrants, working people, and the decline that America is only seeing now through social media. There’s a sub-genre of poverty porn on YouTube where people drive through blighted neighbourhoods, and one of them is Hartford. When I saw it, I thought: ‘Wow, that was my childhood and now it’s entertainment.’ The blight that a lot of America is reckoning with now in the social media age, immigrants have seen for 20, 30 years.”Though the book is rooted in post-industrial America, set in the fictitious town of East Gladness, Conn (“Gladness itself is no more, so it’s East of nothing,” Vuong says)ecticut, The Emperor of Gladness also takes the reader further afield, back in time and to other nations through the memories and preoccupations of its immigrant protagonists. Hai’s cousin Sony, whose family named him after a TV, is obsessed with the American civil war, while Grazina returns to the insurgency against the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in her episodes of dementia. “It was a convenient way to talk about all civil wars,” Vuong says, noting that while America mythologises its own in films such as Gettysburg, “almost every country has had a civil war – England, Vietnam, Korea. It’s that kind of cultural dominance that I’m trying to work against.”Vuong is also determined to excavate the histories that America is once again attempting to suppress, this time under the guise of a war on “wokeness”. “Oh gosh, look at ‘make America great again’,” he says. “That phrase gestures at memory, but in fact it functions on romantic nostalgia, which is ultimately amnesia. Because if you ask, where’s the ‘again’, no one can point to it.”What most Americans don’t want to contemplate, Vuong says, is the role of genocide and slavery in the foundation of their country. “I often think the mistake of the left is to focus on Trump too much,” he says. “Trumpism has been here since Andrew Jackson and George Washington. Trump gives people permission not to look back, or to look back selectively. And then ultimately it becomes an authorial agency to forget.”Vuong was not interested in considering whether or not the staff of HomeMarket would vote for Trump, setting The Emperor of Gladness in 2009. “It was very deliberate to focus on the Obama years, because it was a lot of hopium,” he says. “That quickly deflated when the president we voted in for the people bailed out the corporations. He’s like: they’re too big to fail. And we’re like: oh.” He calls the 2008 presidential election “my first era of political consciousness” and says that it was the first election he participated in.“I remember when I was at Pace going to an auditorium to watch the debate between Obama and Mitt Romney. It felt as if we were headed towards something completely new. Like it was electric. And then to see that it was really just an oligarchical state once again and perhaps always had been, that Obama was in many ways just another side of the Bush coin – as a millennial, it really deflated a lot of my peers. I think the greatest deception of my life, politically, was the Obama administration.”Vuong voted for Kamala Harris, but without much enthusiasm. He says that Bernie Sanders was the Democratic presidential candidate that he and his peers regarded as aligned with their political beliefs. “He would have won [in 2016], I think. But somehow they ousted him from that campaign with the shenanigans of the Iowa caucus. And so when Hillary was announced, we’re like: oh, of course, this is the lesser of two evils that we’re always being told about.”The author has since decided to channel his political activism in other directions. He and Penguin are donating 50c for every pre-order of the US edition (up to $10,000) to the Queer Liberation Library, an organisation that aims to make books with LGBTQ+ themes freely available on its website. This was partly prompted by On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous being removed from libraries by a municipal board in the Conroe independent school district in Texas two years ago, which Vuong and PEN America regarded as a book ban.The justifications were unclear. “At first they said it’s explicit,” Vuong says. “But then there are a lot of other explicit books – The Catcher in the Rye has a sexual assault in it. There’s a whole group of students who go to challenge these decisions at board meetings. So then they adopted a new thing where they would say there’s a circulation issue, or the books aren’t being checked out. They make it logistical, bureaucratic. I was told that it only takes one person to make that decision, whereas banning for inappropriate material requires a committee. So it’s really dystopian, because people who don’t even read are now controlling the future of children’s literary lives.”With America becoming more brutally transphobic by the day, I ask Vuong whether his house is a queer oasis. He says that he has hosted a dozen writers who wanted the space to work on their books, an idea modelled on the house of two trans friends who live nearby and have a child. “At first I was very cis about it; I was: Oh, you have a nuclear family,” he says. “But then I started to observe. Every time I went over, there was a new person there. And it was just trans youth who needed a place to be. So I thought: ‘Oh my goodness. We can rethink the nuclear household or property.’ For a lot of my queer friends, it’s so hard to get into writing residencies and to find a place to do their work. A lot of them are economically vulnerable and losing health care [insurance] in between jobs. And I said: look, there’s space. You don’t have to wait for a grant. You don’t even have to look at me. Just go in there and do the work.”It’s another experiment in the idea of family, Vuong says, since being a writer in America is so tough. “No one helps you make it. So I’ve got an open invitation to my friends – they just have to call. I’ll prep the room. Just come.” The Emperor of Gladness by Ocean Vuong will be published by Jonathan Cape on 15 May.

            "content": "It felt like a classic British beach outing, but with more reliable weather. Toting umbrella, towels, sun cream, water and a cool-box picnic, my husband, son and I turned our backs on the marina in Porto Palo, near Menfi in south-west Sicily, and walked west. About 10 minutes on a narrow signposted coastal path brought us to Le Solette, a half-mile curving golden beach between rocky outcrops and backed by low hills. It’s a gorgeous spot, with soft sand and clear water in hues from turquoise to indigo – but the most remarkable thing about it is not what’s there, but what’s not.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

OK, there is the convenience of loos and showers, but at what cost? I’ve been to resorts in Liguria, in north-west Italy, where from Easter to September a walk along the front affords views not of the sea but of the walls and changing cabins of an unbroken row of beach stabilimenti.But quiet, undeveloped beaches can be found – and more easily in southern Italy, Sardinia and Sicily, and away from cities. (Mondello, near Palermo, for example, also has bathing-establishment blight.) One of our favourite areas is around Menfi – just an hour and 20 minutes’ drive south from Sicily’s capital. Many of the town’s older buildings were destroyed in an earthquake in 1968, so its architectural sights are limited, but it’s in one of the island’s top food- and wine-producing areas, so offers great restaurants, farmers’ markets and vineyard visits.Even better, it’s a couple of miles from a barely developed stretch of coast, where golden sandy beaches – with blue flag status for nearly 20 years – are punctuated with wild, scrubby headlands and small villages. The coast of Tunisia is just 100 miles away, a lot nearer than Naples or Rome.We stayed in a low-rise holiday let, Villa Melograno (sleeps six from €1,430/£1,225 a week) just outside Menfi, enjoying early June temperatures in the mid-20Cs, sea views from the garden and daily forays to whichever seaside spot took our fancy.On lazy days we made for the nearest: dune-backed Lido Fiori, which has a minimarket, a couple of fish restaurants overlooking the water and a clear stream running across its western end.For more bustle, we’d drive to the wider sands of Porto Palo, a fishing village with a good choice of places for an evening pizza. Getting to Le Solette took more effort but this was rewarded with a blissful day of swimming, snoozing and snorkelling, with not a building and barely another person in sight.The Menfi coast does get busier in August, when Italians from Palermo and the mainland arrive and temperatures soar. Shoulder-season heat was perfect (as a bonus, most coastal car parks don’t start charging until mid-June). October, with highs between 21 and 25C, also sounds appealing.This being Sicily, there is plenty to do away from the beach. The fertile, sun-soaked land around Menfi is known for olives, vines and vegetables (particularly the Slow Food-registered spiny artichoke, in season December-April). We enjoyed shopping at the Wednesday farmers’ market in Menfi (in high summer it’s also held on Friday evenings in Porto Palo) for tomatoes, peppers, aubergines, herbs and salads smelling of southern sunshine, plus cheeses and cured meats.Olive oils from the 250-year-old Ravidà estate north-west of Menfi are prized abroad (and stocked in Waitrose); it offers tours, tastings and cookery classes. But if we come back in autumn, we’ll head instead to the down-to-earth Casale Abate, which offers a “family olive harvest” (weekends from 26 September-26 October, €250 for four people including two nights’ accommodation) where everyone joins in hand-picking the olives, pressing them and tasting the ultra-fresh oil on warm bread.Younger families would love a new attraction that opened last autumn close to Casale Abate: at the Ricupa open farm, kids can have a go at collecting eggs, milking cows and goats, picking fruit and learning how vegetables grow.At the start of this century, the Menfi area was in the early stages of a wine renaissance, revitalising a tradition that began before the Romans, flourished under Julius Caesar (whose favourite wine came from Sicily) but languished in the 20th century as bulk shipments of low-grade plonk became the norm. Now refocused on quality wines, the area is being called “Menfishire”, or “Sicily’s Chiantishire”, and its 7,000 hectares produce 40% of the labelled wine that Sicily exports around the world. We tried the Mandrarossa winery, on the way to Porto Palo, and enjoyed our pick of four wines, with nibbles, on a panoramic terrace with views out to sea (€30pp). Its plummy, blackberry, peppery 2023 nero d’avola lingered long on the palate, and in my memory.Another day we hired bicycles from Sanzone in Menfi to ride the well-surfaced former railway line from Menfi to Porto Palo, earning a large ice-cream each from Gusto Giusto on the main road into the village. Our son was so inspired that the next day he cycled east on the same path to meet us 10 miles away in the port of Sciacca, with its baroque centre and Castello Incantato (adult €5), a slightly mad sculpture park created in 1919 by émigré Filippo Bentivegna returning after an unhappy stay in the US. The top cultural draw around here is a lot older than that, though.Sign up to The TravellerGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidaysafter newsletter promotionThis year will see bigger than usual crowds at the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, 50 miles east of Menfi, as the town basks in being Italy’s Capital of Culture. So 2025 is a good time to visit instead the more extensive, if less intact, ruins of the Greek settlement of Selinunte (adult €14) founded in the seventh century BC. It’s only a 20-minute drive from Menfi, so we went one cloudless morning and wandered open-mouthed, and mostly alone, from one huge ruin against its backdrop of sparkling sea to another (Temple E is the best-preserved), a relatable grid of streets to the north with the remains of housing and shops, and an acropolis with five more temples. Come lunchtime we had walked miles and were glad to collapse in the sea-view bar by Poseidon’s temple. (A little electric train trundles round the site and may be tempting in high summer, though it’s a little pricey at €8pp.)Though grand in its day, with a population of 30,000 (or 100,000; experts disagree), Selinunte had a relatively short life, lasting about 240 years. It was destroyed by Carthaginians in about 250BC, during the first Punic war, and never rebuilt. Earthquakes, weather and time have since added their depredations.And there it sits, sun-soaked, wave-lapped and so vast it can absorb bus-loads of visitors without ever feeling crowded. A bit like this whole, happy coastline.Casale Abate has one- and two-bedroom bungalows with a shared pool 15 minutes’ drive from the beach, from €427 a week, on booking.comRight on Lido Fiori beach, Le 4 Stagioni has rooms from €90 B&B and one- and two-bed apartments from €100. Its restaurant specialises in local fish, paired with wine or Sicilian craft beers.Salisà is a slightly smarter fish restaurant just along the beach, which a couple of years ago added peaceful new-build accommodation among fields half a mile inland, with rooms (from €126 B&B), pool and generous breakfasts.In the centre of Menfi, La Regina di Alabastro does traditional fish and meat dishes and great pizzas. Elegant rooms sleep two to five from €110 room-only. Hourly buses run in summer from the town to Porto Palo and Lido Fiori.",

            "content": "Even the best-laid holiday plans can go awry. Illness, bereavements, break-ups, money problems, redundancy, pregnancy, jury duty, floods – all of these can throw a getaway into disarray.But while you may miss out on a break in the sun or relaxing city break, you do not necessarily have to lose all of your money as a result of problems at home that force you to cancel your trip. You can now sell on your holiday in much the same way you sell on a concert ticket, although that is not the only way to get some money back.This will depend on how close you are to going away and what sort of booking you made. It is unlikely that you will get all of your money back when you cancel a package holiday as most are sold as not fully refundable.The closer you cancel to the departure date, the more it is likely to cost you. Tui, one of the biggest tour operators in the UK, will keep the deposit paid on a holiday if it is cancelled 70 days or more before departure and then a growing percentage of the overall price as you get closer to take-off.For example, if you cancel 65 days before, you will have to pay 30% of the booking price, while if there are two weeks or less to go you will pay the whole cost. Jet2Holidays has similar charges.If you put the holiday together yourself, then often the flight part will not be refundable if you decide not to travel.Ryanair’s terms and conditions say if you do not travel, you are not entitled to money back.EasyJet allows cancellations within 24 hours of booking but charges a £49 fee online (£55 if you do it through customer services). Some other airlines offer refundable tickets. These typically cost more than standard tickets when you buy them – so check which type you have.Hotels’ terms and conditions vary and some allow free cancellation up to a day before the booking, although there could be a fee, while some are partially refundable. However, many will be non-refundable.First, contact your tour operator, airline, ferry company or hotel as soon as you know that you will not be travelling to see what money you can get back.Some travel operators may be lenient when it comes to cancellation caused by unforeseen illness and let you move the holiday to another date out of goodwill.Matt Gatenby, a partner at the law firm Travlaw, says that if you contact a company to explain you have been taken ill, it may suggest you can go at a later date. Airlines, however, are typically not as lenient or sympathetic, he adds.Even if a booking is non-refundable it is worth contacting the company and explaining what has gone wrong. If, for example, you are cancelling because you have been diagnosed with a serious illness, some will waive the usual rules and offer a refund if you can provide a doctor’s letter as evidence.Many travel insurance policies have cancellation cover which will pay out if you have to cancel for reasons set out in the T&Cs. For example, one policy from Admiral (£36 for a family of four for a year) pays out in case of death or serious injury of you or a close relative; a Covid diagnosis; quarantine; court cases; unemployment; damage to your home from fire or unemployment.Make sure that you have enough cancellation cover for the trip. The one above will pay out up to £1,500 a person but with an excess of £150. What it will not pay out on is if you cancel because you had a pre-existing condition or if you simply do not want to travel.It is possible to sell on a holiday you can no longer use, but it is not straightforward and you are unlikely to recoup all of the money you have spent.A number of websites and groups on social media have emerged in recent years whereby people who have non-refundable holidays, flights or hotels can pass them on to someone else once the names on the bookings have been changed and fees paid.This week, on a Facebook group called “Holidays for sale booked and paid but can’t go or cancel”, one woman was selling a week-long family holiday to Turkey – which starts on Sunday – for £800 after paying more than £1,600. She said it was because she would not have a passport on time. Another person was selling a double room in Amsterdam for three nights for the end of June for £350. She said it had cost her £481.Two websites, SpareFare and Transfer Travel, operate eBay-style marketplaces in which people can sell on their holiday, flight and hotel bookings.On SpareFare, a US-based site, there is a two-person holiday to Faro in Portugal, with flights from Gatwick, for 10 nights this week for £1,001 – half the price it would currently cost from the provider, according to the site. A week-long holiday in Mallorca from 21 May, with flights from Manchester for three, is £1,005, almost half of the market price.Transfer Travel, meanwhile, has return flights for two to Jamaica in September for £950, down from £1,950. Two weeks in Corfu with flights from Luton and accommodation at the Aqualand resort is £1,040 for two.You can check whether a package holiday can be transferred by contacting the provider. With package holidays, flights and hotels in most cases it simply involves changing the names and details of the booking once you have found a buyer and agreed a price.Erik Ritland,the owner of SpareFare, says swapping the name on a holiday is an easier process than it was in the past and requires the name, date of birth and address of the buyer. Changing the name usually involves a fee. For Tui, this is £25. On Jet2holidays it is £50 unless it is within two weeks of travel and then it goes up to £150, while changing the date of birth is £10.Ryanair name changes are £115 a person for each flight, meaning it can often not be worthwhile selling on your booking.On SpareFare, the seller pays the name-change fee because they are the only person able to alter the details, says Ritland.The fee is included in the amount they charge for the holiday. The site charges the seller 12% commission on the final selling price. Transfer Travel charges 15% commission and the seller pays for the name change.On both SpareFare and Transfer Travel, a buyer can barter or bid for a different price to that being advertised. Each site says that they ensure the holidays and flights are legitimate before sale through a verification process.You claimed on insuranceIf you have claimed on an insurance policy, for example if they have a serious illness, you cannot then go on and sell the holiday to someone else. “That would be fraudulent as they would effectively have a double refund,” Gatenby says.Insurance companies usually require a cancellation invoice from a travel business before they process a claim to prevent such a thing happening.",

            "content": "Julian Wilson’s incredible run from the trial to the title has fallen just short with the Australian surfing veteran beaten in the final of the Gold Coast Pro.The 36-year-old squared off against Filipe Toledo in the title decider which was a repeat of their 2015 final, also won by the Brazilian, and was edged in a thriller 17.60 to 17.20.Fellow Australian Sally Fitzgibbons also went down swinging in the women’s final with Hawaii’s Bettylou Sakura Johnson claiming her first World Surf League trophy.After almost four years away from the tour, Wilson claimed the sole wildcard for the main event at Burleigh Heads by winning the pre-competition trial.He then surfed his way right through to Saturday’s final, beating the likes of Jack Robinson, Miguel Pupo and Japan’s Kanoa Igarashi in the semi-final.Wilson and Toledo went blow for blow in the final, with the crowd packed on the headland roaring their approval for both veterans as they repeatedly took to the air.In his first final for 2025 after taking last season off, Toledo, who scored a perfect 10 ride in his semi-final, set the benchmark early with an 8.53 which he backed up with a 9.07.Filipe turning up the dial and dropping a 9.07 off rail work.The @originalbonsoy #GoldCoastPro Final is LIVE on https://t.co/ie0ZfMVLPY@gwmaustralia @experiencegoldcoast @queensland pic.twitter.com/7TmaMUhFpsFormer world No 2 Wilson kept hammering, with his top scoring waves of 8.80 and 8.40 coming in the back-end of the final in a heated finish.But in the end there was no fairytale finish and fifth title for the Sunshine Coast product, who will compete in the Challenger Series next year.“It was crazy with the rematch with Jules,” Toledo said. “With Jules coming back to the tour, winning the trial and going all the way it was such a special moment for him.”Seeking her first CT title since a win at Rottnest Island in 2021, Fitzgibbons was also denied by the Hawaiian young gun.The 34-year-old threw everything at her young rival, surfing a mammoth 13 waves, but fell short with a two-wave score of 7.83 to Sakura Johnson’s impressive tally of 15.33.Fitzgibbons was on the back foot from the get-go, with her 20-year-old opponent posting a score of 8.50 on her first wave.Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionafter newsletter promotionThe Gerroa surfer went to the air four times, trying to stick a landing that would give her a score to put her back in contention, but she was unable to seal the deal.It was Sakura Johnson’s second win of the day over a local hope after earlier eliminating top-ranked Australian Molly Picklum in the quarter-finals.“This is the best feeling in the world, and I’m over the moon to have my first win here on the Gold Coast,” said Sakura Johnson, competing in her second final after bursting on to the scene as a 16-year-old.“This is what winning feels like, and I want to keep winning.

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/police-raid-london-quaker-meeting-house-very-worrying",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 08:31",
            "content": "When six young women gathered in central London to discuss the climate crisis and the war in Gaza, the setting could not have been more appropriate. The building in which they sat was a Quaker meeting house, the home of a movement whose centuries-long history is rooted in protest and a commitment to social justice. On the table were cups of jasmine tea, ginger biscuits and a selection of vegan cheese straws.But the events that brought this apparently convivial gathering to an abrupt end have sparked protests of a different kind and raised questions about how justice is administered by the UK’s largest and most embattled police force.Talk among the youth activists that evening had turned to the 1963 Children’s March in Birmingham, Alabama, when a flash of blue light interrupted the chatter. Seconds later up to 30 Metropolitan police officers, some armed with stun guns, smashed down the door of the Grade II-listed building and arrested the young women inside.One of the six, 18-year-old Zahra Ali, was held in a cell for 17 hours. Another was “rear stacked”, hands cuffed behind her back and held against the wall in what she described as an hour-long ordeal. Phones were seized and laptops bagged as evidence.The raid, described as “intelligence-led”, was targeting the protest group Youth Demand. The members in attendance were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance. Five remain under investigation.Six weeks on, the operation has drawn criticism from religious groups, politicians and activists. The need for such a severe course of action, meted out in a place of worship, remains a concern, not least for those who were targeted.“I was the last one to be taken into custody,” said Ali, the youngest of the six women. “I got to the station about 10pm-ish and I had to wait two hours to be booked in. I was taken to a freezing cold cell for hours. I wasn’t allowed a personal call. I didn’t get to speak to my solicitor until he came in person.“We saw the blue lights a second before they marched in. We were just a bunch of young people talking about our government, about protesting, and they arrested us for that.“I think had they rung the bell we would have let them in, obviously … They didn’t have to raid us. It’s six young women in a room, in a place that we hired, that we publicly advertised, and they could have just sat in and listened to us. I don’t really see any conspiracy in that.”That accusation of conspiracy is one that particularly jars with the young women. A life-drawing class and therapy session had been taking place in the same building; the meeting hardly took place in secret, the women say.“We post on Instagram, we have posters and leaflets. It’s a weekly welcome talk and usually, if they had good intelligence, they would know that it’s never that busy, never enough for it to [warrant] 30 police officers.”Youth Demand, which includes young veterans of the Just Stop Oil movement, had posted online it was planning to “shut down London” on a daily basis in April. The group staged a series of protests last month, including during the London Marathon when two activists were arrested after red powder paint was thrown on Tower Bridge.The group, which is calling for a trade embargo on Israel, had previously made headlines for staging a “dirty protest” by appearing to defecate at Rishi Sunak’s £2m manor house in Yorkshire, and for spray-painting Labour’s headquarters red.For Lia-Anjali Lazarus, a 20-year-old politics and languages student at UCL, the raid was “a traumatic experience”. “The raid and arrest felt extremely violating. It left me feeling paranoid and jumpy. It’s hard not to feel like a criminal when you’re blatantly treated as one,” she said.\nPolice confiscated her phone, laptop, her diary, Oyster card and French grammar book. “I said it’s my French grammar book and the officer said: ‘Well how do I know that. I don’t speak French.’”Lazarus said the police’s outrageous response felt like “thought policing”, but she wasn’t too surprised considering the arrests of Just Stop Oil activists at a community centre soup night last year.\n  Paul Parker, the recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said no one in living memory had been arrested at a Quaker meeting house. Quakers is a nickname for members of the Religious Society of Friends.Mal Woolford, an elder of the Westminster Quaker Meeting who was present at the time, said the gathering had looked like an innocuous meeting of drama students. He described the police response as “ridiculously heavy-handed” as he recalled speaking to the investigating officer during the arrests. “I was saying things like: ‘Would you have done this to a church? What was your assessment that you did?’ And the assessment seemed to be along the lines of: ‘We realised we’d meet no resistance.’”\n Woolford said the police had appeared to want “the element of surprise”. “For them it was about: ‘We need to catch them in the act.’ How you catch somebody in the act of talking about potentially doing something is kind of thought crimes or pre-crime and we’re in sort of Minority Report territory,” he said.“The investigating officer was saying: ‘We have intelligence that this meeting is happening and that they’re planning criminality.’ I was trying to think what intelligence would that be? And then I realised afterwards that it’s on the [Youth Demand] website. It’s not intelligence; it’s just publicly available information.”The Green party co-leader Carla Denyer, who describes herself as a nontheist Quaker, joined a Quaker vigil outside New Scotland Yard in central London last month in response to the raid.The MP for Bristol Central said: “This isn’t just about a single incident, this is about an increasing stamping down on the right to peaceful protest in this country. The previous Conservative government brought in laws that restrict the right to peaceful protest and the current Labour government has not so far made any commitments to repeal those.”Jenny Jones, the Green party peer, who was also at the vigil, described the Met’s actions as “absolutely outrageous”.\n Lady Jones has written to the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, to ask about the incident. “At what level was the decision to break down the door of a peaceful community, where was that taken? Did he have the say so or was it much lower?” she said. “And that’s absolutely crucial, because that will show just how badly the police have understood the legislation.”A Met police spokesperson said five of the women had been released on bail pending further inquiries and one would face no further action. A further six people were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance on 28 March and bailed.The spokesperson said: “We absolutely recognise the importance of the right to protest, but we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality.“This was action against those from Youth Demand, conspiring to ‘shut down’ London, including by blocking roads, with all the disruption that would cause to the general public just trying to go about their day-to-day business.”Denyer, who was introduced to Quakerism at Durham University, said the incident set a “very worrying” precedent.“The government have been talking about providing protection to faith groups and their places of worship in law and yet what police did was exactly the opposite,” she said. “As many people who know their British history and their Quaker history have since remarked, when the government are after the Quakers, you know you’re in trouble.”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/10/australia-wallaroos-new-zealand-black-ferns-rugby-union-test-match-report",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 08:20",
            "content": "With a dismal record against New Zealand – the most recent result a 62-0 blackout in Brisbane last year – breaking the Black Ferns’ 27-match hoodoo was always going to be a tough ask for the Wallaroos. And so it proved, as Australia’s women’s side were dealt a reality check ahead of the Rugby World Cup in August, crashing to a 38-12 defeat in their Pacific Four Series opener.Even against the champions in six of the past seven World Cups, the Wallaroos went into this Test at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle with their tails up. Last week, they put Fijiana to the sword 43-7 in Suva for a fourth straight victory. It lifted their world ranking to No 6 and got them dreaming of a semi-final at the World Cup in England.Coach Jo Yapp has been reinforcing her 15-a-side ranks with stars from the successful Sevens program. Although Tegan and Maddison Levi, Bella Nasser, Kahli Henwood and Sariah Paki this week gave up their quest to make the World Cup squad, Yapp promoted Olympians Charlotte Caslick and Tia Hinds to the run-on side in this Test.Yet the gulf between New Zealand, the tier one powerhouses, and Australia, the tier two challengers, was apparent from the get-go. Before kick-off they met the Ko Uhia Mai in boomerang formation and sure enough their defensive line stayed bent all half.With star centres Maya Stewart and Bienne Terita injured, the Wallaroos were dominating possession yet consistently losing territory as the Black Ferns’ line speed swallowed all their attacking space. It rattled the home side and they rashly quick tapped on their own line instead of kicking out of trouble. The New Zealanders swiftly punished the petulance, winger Ayesha Leti-I’iga scooting away to make it 7-0.In the 26th minute the back-pedalling allowed Leti-I’iga to snipe off the ruck and score again. It left the Wallaroos 14-0 down inside half an hour. Under siege, they rallied. Pig-tailed winger Desiree Miller flew to win back a stray kick for touch. Hinds torpedoed a kick into enemy territory. Caslick forced a turnover. For a few thrilling minutes the Wallaroos threw caution to the wind in a desperate bid to turn the tide.But the Black Ferns calmly weathered the storm then thundered downfield at speed. When their powerful forwards piled in like jackals, the black mass swallowed all gold jerseys. Maia Joseph scooped up the ball and spat it in a long arc to Braxton Sorensen-McGee on the wing to score although replays showed a knock-on before touchdown.The Australians refused to sulk, even when Black Ferns prop Chryss Viliko crashed over two minutes after half-time to blow the scoreline out to 26-0. Instead they went to their most potent weapon: the rolling maul. In the 46th minute they set it in motion, rolling into the red zone before a brilliant lineout put prop Eva Karapani over.Having landed a punch on the Black Ferns at last, the Wallaroos upped their intensity. Yapp had brought her Sevens stars in hoping their experience regularly vanquishing New Zealanders in the reduced competition might smash the hoodoo in 15s too. For a time it looked to be working. Twice in two minutes, Caslick broke the line and almost ran away.Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionWhen centre Georgina Friedrichs got a lunging fingertip on a kick chase, the whiff of an upset was back on the breeze. Alas, referee Clara Munarini disallowed the try. It was a cruel blow but again the Wallaroos kept their chins up. Four minutes later, their rolling maul set up Ashley Marsters’ snipe to make it 26-12 with 20 minutes to go.But the rearguard effort had sapped the Australians and the Black Ferns recovered, breaking the Wallaroos ranks with a breathtaking passage of play that sent Sylvia Brunt stepping through the wreckage to score the winning five-pointer in the corner. Sorensen-McGee’s late long range second try was the final nail in the golden coffin.The 26-point defeat was decisive but the Wallaroos will take plenty from this game. They held the Black Ferns to 12-all in the second half and with the scrubbing of Braxton Sorensen-McGee’s dubious first try and the addition of what looked to be Friedrich’s legitimate touchdown the final score might’ve been much closer.“We have to start the game as we’re finishing,” said Wallaroos hooker Ash Marsters. Captain Siokapesi PaluPalu concurred; “Had we come out in the first half with the intent we showed in the second, we probably would’ve got a very different result. It’s all about intent and fire, body language and energy. We’ll bring all that next week.”",

            "content": "A couple of months ago, after Henry Pollock scored his first Premiership try against Sale in what is sure to be a contender for try of the season, I got a little excited. I called Phil Dowson – someone I have known since he was 19 – to speak to him about this star in the making. I asked if I was getting carried away with myself. Phil said he is a good kid who works hard on his game, and the next day I’m thinking about Pollock as a midweek captain for the British & Irish Lions.Fast forward two months and I’m of the same opinion. This isn’t me getting swept up in the hype, and that certainly isn’t to say Pollock cannot force his way into the Lions Test team or squad, but just give him the responsibility and let him flourish.The longer the tour goes on, it becomes harder for the midweek team. The more that you are playing on Wednesday and not Saturday, the more tempting it is to feel like you are not a proper part of the tour. There’s a midweek match between the first and second Tests and basically no one wants to play in it. Pollock will, though. He’ll want to play every minute of every match.You just have to look at his level of energy. Andy Farrell will be urging him to put that energy into each single minute of the tour. For it to remain at fever pitch. I’d be saying to Pollock: “Be captain, lead us in midweek. You’ll make mistakes but so will all of us.” There may be other players with more experience, better suited to the role who may make better captains but Pollock will be the most excitable man in Australia. Give him the honour and watch him go. My only reservation would be that the responsibility might take away from any of his game but if that is not the case, he would be my pick.In terms of Pollock the player, he’s part of an extremely competitive back-row selection but you can’t actually compare him to anyone else. Not Josh van der Flier, not Jac Morgan, not Ben Earl. Stylistically, he’s so different from everyone else. All the highlights reels we see do not take away from all the standard things he is supposed to do as a flanker. He excels at all of those while adding the flashy bits. How he can drive people has just made him impossible to ignore in Farrell’s eyes. In many ways, it just isn’t a surprise that he has been picked.Last summer, when Pollock was part of the under-20 side who won the Junior World Cup, it might have been. He was still playing in the under-20s’ Six Nations this year and it is an incredible rise to get to the point where his Lions selection was almost expected. But rugby needs people like him.At the squad announcement there were spectators from England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland but they all went crazy for him when his name was read out. Farrell had a massive smile on his face because he loves the energy Pollock generates.He’s also part of a new wave of Lions. These things are cyclical and when I went on the 2009 tour, I played with a load of legends of the game who were coming towards the end. Four years later, new Lions legends were born in Australia. I look at Sam Warburton who didn’t tour in 2009 and captained the squad in 2013. By the end of that tour, Brian O’Driscoll found himself out of the Test side because Jonathan Davies established himself.Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionFour years later in New Zealand, players such as Davies, Johnny Sexton, Owen Farrell and Taulupe Faletau went on their second tours and cemented their status with the Lions. In South Africa four years later it was the last hurrah for a lot of those players and now there is not a single player in the squad who toured in 2013. There is real symmetry between 2013 and 2025. There are 26 first-time tourists in a squad of 38 but how many will go on to become Lions legends across multiple tours?That said, for many it will be their only shot. It’s so important that you do not forget how special it is. My message to everyone selected is to always keep in mind what it is to be a Lion. It’s the most special time, the most special jersey to wear and the most special club to be a part of.The schedule is frantic, it’s hectic; you can feel like you’re constantly on the move, going from city to city, training, midweek matches, Saturday matches so the danger is that it can pass you by. But once the final whistle goes at the end of the final Test, that’s it. It’s over. My advice to every player is to be really intentional about the memories you want to make.",

            "content": "It was about 7pm when UMF Grindavík’s players finished training in the club’s indoor hall. There had been seismic activity in the area all day but, in this harbour town to the south of Iceland’s famous Blue Lagoon, everybody had become wearily used to that. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had been a discomfiting, menacing backdrop to the previous three years. Everyday life had continued but now, on 10 November 2023, nature was to have its say. Four hours after its football team had completed their session, the danger had become intolerable and Grindavík was evacuated. Their once-thriving home quickly turned into a ghost town.Nobody would dream of using the hall for football now. Its pitch is cleaved in two by a fissure up to 25 metres deep; one of the most striking images in a settlement that has been ripped apart. A chasm has destroyed their outdoor practice pitch too. But something remarkable will happen in Grindavík on Saturday: football will lead the way in a recovery few could have foreseen over the past 18 months. Grindavík will play at their Stakkavíkurvöllur home for the first time since the town’s abandonment, hosting Fjölnir in a second-tier fixture whose outcome feels distinctly secondary.Haukur Guðberg Einarsson never lost faith that Grindavík would return, not even when eight more eruptions ravaged the surrounding area and hampered any attempts to rebuild. “That’s been my mission every day and every night,” says the club chair, whose lifelong involvement there began as a player. “I’ve been fighting with nature but never gave up: never, ever.”Residents were allowed to visit Grindavík in the weeks after evacuation, restricted to a few minutes in which they could gather belongings. “I had to focus on my family first,” Einarsson says. “Then I turned to the football club. For about three weeks I travelled back and forth in bad winter conditions. I had to save the club and put it somewhere.”Grindavík were initially housed by Víkingur Reykjavík. “They kept us alive,” Einarsson says. “We were just freefalling and they grabbed us.” A number of other local clubs assisted too, although games were sparsely attended. “People were mentally not good,” he continues. The town’s economy had been decimated: the club lost 40% of its sponsors and Einarsson was among hundreds to lose their jobs as companies shut down. It did, at least, mean he could devote more time to his obsession. Grindavík needed to be home, at the picturesque Stakkavíkurvöllur, whose main surface had miraculously avoided destruction, as soon as it was deemed safe.“I had to talk with the government, lots of meetings with the police, lots of experts who had to check whether everything was OK under the pitch,” he says. “We don’t want to take people if it’s not 150% safe. Many times we had to take one step forward and two steps back: you’d try to work and then we’d be told another eruption was coming and have to leave again. We were working, testing and waiting for what nature was going to do next.”When the latest eruption, as recently as 1 April, sent lava spewing towards the town, Einarsson feared his quest was destined to fail. “I thought it was the last time I would ever see the pitch,” he says. But it stopped short and, on Monday, Stakkavíkurvöllur was given the all-clear. Geophysical surveys showed the renovated venue was not at risk and up to 1,500 supporters could attend on Saturday. There will be a concert, children’s entertainment, food stands and the sense of a community reuniting around one of its most precious institutions.“This is a huge, huge thing for us in Grindavík,” Einarsson says. “It was very special to be told we can play. It’s very hard for me to explain my feelings about this. Everything I own, all of my life, is Grindavík.”It does not mean Grindavík will return immediately to its old self. While the town has been back open since late October, only about 40 houses are occupied. Many dwellings are ruined beyond repair. The football club are an advance party of hope, of promise that better times will eventually arrive. “There are people that can’t go back, or won’t because they are scared or heartbroken,” he says. “It’s going to take many years to build Grindavík up again.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionThe squad have been training at Stakkavíkurvöllur over the past month; recently they have conspicuously taken post-session meals at a nearby pizza restaurant that has reopened. They wanted to be seen out and about, presenting a vision of normality away from the field. But there are reminders of the surreal, terrifying context in every glance: the club’s biggest sponsor, whose name is emblazoned on their shirts, has built the 12-metre high defence walls that now circle the town to prevent it being overwhelmed by lava flow.Grindavík, who count the former Manchester United and England winger Lee Sharpe among their alumni, have a proud history and will seek a return to the Úrvalsdeild, Iceland’s top flight, one day. A young side, largely rebuilt with academy players, they are unlikely to achieve that this season but are about to accomplish something far bigger. The people of Grindavík may still have to reckon with a traumatic past, but they can see a beacon to the future.“We start step by step,” Einarsson says. “It will be OK. With a big heart and all the will in the world, it’s possible that Grindavík will be alive again.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 08:00",
            "content": "Real Madrid’s players arrived at training on Wednesday morning to find seven teddy bears waiting for them. Lined up on a bush outside Valdebebas, they wore white shirts and a banner had been placed in front of them, alongside a couple of Spain flags with the club badge in the middle where the crown should go. “Grazie, Inter,” it said. The night before, Simone Inzaghi’s side had done for them what they had not been able to do for themselves, at least not yet. Now perhaps it can be their turn, one last chance to salvage something from what has been somebody else’s season.Barcelona had been beaten: there would be no Champions League and no treble, reason alone to celebrate or at least seek consolation in Madrid, if not the only one. Because if it’s tempting to ask: “Is that all you’ve got?” somehow the answer may still be: “Actually, no.” Four days on from Barcelona’s European exit, Montjuïc hosts the fourth clásico of 2024-25 in a fourth stadium. Madrid have lost the previous three – 4-0, 5-2 and 3-2, seeing their rivals go top of the table, win the Super Cup and the Copa del Rey. Lose a fourth, and they will see them win the league title too, Hansi Flick’s team would be seven points clear with nine in play, a double within reach, while Madrid are left with nothing.But win …? Win, and suddenly the picture looks different. Win and Madrid would be a point behind, and their three games are easier than Barcelona’s: Mallorca, Sevilla and Real Sociedad compared with a derby at Espanyol followed by Champions League-chasing Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao. “We would still have a small disadvantage but we would have more of a chance,” Carlo Ancelotti said. “The clásico will be practically decisive.” Fede Valverde called it “the game of the season”.They always say that – “it’s the game of the century, even if there are eight a year,” one former Barcelona player says – but Valverde isn’t far wrong. For Madrid, at least, it’s all that’s left. Football’s greatest rivals have played each other 260 times since 1902, one newspaper describing the scene then as one of “little ladies in wasp-waist dresses, rice flower on pretty faces; grave solemn gentlemen, dark colours brightened by a carnation through the buttonhole; dandies in sparkling uniforms; military men corseted into tight waistcoats and trousers like bullfighters; and playboys who have sneaked in, top hats and walking sticks with marble handles”, and every meeting seems to define the season. Rarely though has it so clearly been a title decider.The closest recent comparable may be 2012, when Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner at the Camp Nou and then did that calm down gesture, Pep Guardiola conceding the title after. Or 2009 when Barcelona won 6-2 at the Santiago Bernabéu, ending Madrid’s unlikely and relentless pursuit. Both times, the leaders came with a four-point advantage at the top, their challengers offered an opportunity, the hope that they might close in, like now; both times, they left with a seven-point lead, the title secure. But even those weren’t as late as this. By kick-off on Sunday afternoon, week 35 of 38, this will be everything.And yet, in truth, this clásico hasn’t really felt like the game of the season, nor had the buildup of other occasions. There was something about the Copa del Rey final a fortnight ago that was The End, the scenes at full time in which players threw ice cubes at the referee were Madrid’s final meltdown, a rage against the dying light. For Madrid, long since defeated by Arsenal, reality looking them in the face, the curtain was drawn that night, like this campaign had been concluded, written off. The future was somewhere beyond May, the conversation and the questions focused elsewhere. When, not if, will Ancelotti go? When will Xabi Alonso arrive? Who’s coming with him? Who’s going? How do you find the right way to say goodbye?Barcelona’s attention meanwhile naturally turned to Inter, something even bigger building. It wasn’t to be, the treble gone. For Barcelona, there was pride in defeat, the most extraordinary semi-final anyone could recall, but it had hurt badly. For Madrid, there was relief; perhaps also a reminder: that Barcelona are not invincible, that it is not done yet, that there is still a league to play for. Perhaps even a reminder even of the Copa final where, while utterly outplayed by Barcelona in the first half and beaten in the end, there was at last a rebellion in the second, the startling inferiority complex that had afflicted them shaken off just long enough to be within minutes of winning.After the season Madrid have had, the feeling of complete system failure, in which they haven’t defeated a decent team and Barcelona have put 12 past them, it would be almost absurd if they won the league; if, in the final, cold analysis, they could claim to have been more successful than Barcelona, La Liga surely trumping the cup. The difference has been unquestionable, Barcelona having the time of their lives, top of the league since February, closing on 100 league goals, and having won 13 and drawn one of the past 14 games, while Madrid have gone through a campaign feeling as if they’re not even there. And yet, here we are. That’s not such a leap now.Winning is an obligation, yes, but it has become an opportunity too, a second chance or perhaps a third or fourth. One last shot, certainly. Not least for Kylian Mbappé, who with 36 goals can hardly be declared a failure but who no one has declared an unqualified success either. Unless, perhaps, he can make this moment his as he almost did with the cup final but failed to do on too many other nights. The signing whose season this was always going to be, he has seen it slip away, symbolic of their fall, while Paris Saint-Germain have reached the Champions League final without him; while Lamine Yamal may even have overtaken him as the game’s biggest star.For Barcelona it is an opportunity too and one they will welcome if the previous clásicos are a guide, but it has also become an obligation – to ensure that all that enthusiasm, all that excitement, does not become disappointment, loss. That a long season ends as enjoyably as it has mostly played out.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionIt has been long, that is for sure. Both teams come with injuries, fatigue. Neither have their first-choice full-backs, although Barcelona are optimistic that Alejandro Balde will make it and Robert Lewandowski, a late substitute in Milan, will be able to start. Six Barcelona starters didn’t join Thursday’s session.For Madrid, Arda Guler looks set to replace Rodrygo, Ancelotti wanting to add to midfield. But this is a game that feels as much a question of mind as fitness or form. San Siro could not have gone better for Madrid: Barcelona had been beaten, they had also been hurt. They had been taken to extra time, left exhausted and empty. There is always a psychological element to the clásico and this time, possibly more than before, that comes to the surface. What does defeat in Italy do to Barcelona? What does it do to Madrid?Barcelona have played fearlessly, but for many of their young players, this was the first real blow of their careers; does that affect them?“I don’t think so; this team has an incredible mentality,” Ronald Araújo said. “This won’t affect us, quite the contrary,” Eric García insisted. “This team has overcome all expectations.” Flick told his players that when they got back he wanted them to look in the mirror and feel proud. Two days later, they had a barbecue together, a little therapy to go with the food, ready for one last go. “Sunday is a final,” Lamine Yamal said, if not the one he had wanted on Tuesday night.",

            "content": "The thing about always saying yes to the person with the biggest stick is that, in the end, you don’t get to say yes any more. Or no. Or anything else for that matter. The thing about always taking the money is that in the end the money has to be repaid. The thing about aligning all your interests with a single furiously nationalistic political party is … Well, it’s the thing we have now.It would be incorrect to say English cricket and the ECB are in danger of being compromised, financially menaced and basically screwed by ripples from the deeply distressing, potentially apocalyptic escalation of military conflict in Kashmir. Or rather it would be incomplete to say this. English cricket is all of these things. But more widely cricket everywhere is screwed by this. Financially, structurally, even – and this feels like laughter in the dark – morally.It always feels jarring to talk about sport, which doesn’t matter, when people are being bombed, killed and displaced. Or to worry about a Test series when violently opposed nuclear powers are squaring off across the border.But it is also necessary to talk about sport, because sport insists on allowing itself to be marched into these things, one hand placed firmly on the small of its back, an enabler, a bystander and a willing supplicant; because cricket is the most politicised of all sports, its entire infrastructure hostage to the whims of India’s ruling BJP party; and because, more avoidably, English cricket has allowed itself to be run entirely by invertebrate marketing people.Only last week the sensationally tone deaf Lancashire chief executive, Daniel Gidney, announced that the Hundred should sell a stake in itself to the Board of Control for India in Cricket and in effect to the Indian government, because, well, they do really good fireworks over there, comments that were reported without question by a compliant media. He said something about product and stakeholders. Stick it in. So how does that look now? We still on for it? Daniel?The news on Friday morning that the Indian Premier League season has been suspended was both unsurprising and entirely correct. The England player Will Jacks was one of those evacuated on special trains from Dharamsala, where Punjab Kings had been playing Delhi Capitals. A drone explosion near the Rawalpindi stadium has now led to the relocation of the Pakistan Super League, with talk of panicked cricketers and a scrabble for flights.This matters a great deal in simple economic terms. The IPL is the second most lucrative dollars-per-minute sports league in the world after the NFL. India are due to kick off a five-Test series in England next month, an event with a heavy bearing on the cashflow of the sport in this country.There is no suggestion yet that this won’t happen. The ECB is “monitoring the situation”, so that’s all fine then. But what is it going to look like now? What agency does anyone in English cricket have to object to the politicising of this event, or to comment in any way on the Kashmir conflict. Answer: absolutely zero. Keep stumm and play the game, eh chaps. Or we take your ball home.How about the logistics? How will the Edgbaston Test play out in a city where 17% of the population has Pakistani origins, where local MPs are already calling for calm? Or in London where there are protests outside embassies? How will it feel to be England spinner Shoaib Bashir, made to wait for his visa to India last year because of his Pakistani ancestry? What happens when anyone, from offices of state to Row K in the Cakebread Stand, objects to his selection?And where does this leave the Oval Invincibles, currently being sold to the Ambani family, who have obvious ties to the Indian government? Who pays for the security operation? What about the vibe? How is the fawningly bland commentary going to gloss this? Will journalism be allowed to happen? Will anyone mention the fact not one of 50 Pakistanis to enter the Hundred draft were selected, for reasons that remain unclear. Never mind. Bring the family!Plus there’s the wider issue of what happens to international cricket, so utterly dependent on the eyeball power of the Indian teams. Gautam Gambhir, India head coach and BJP politician, has already called for India to simply stop playing Pakistan, something nobody would have any locus standi to object to. Do as you like. It’s your game.The women’s ODI World Cup in India starting in September has Pakistan and India scheduled to play at a neutral venue (good luck finding one of those). Next year’s T20 World Cup will be hosted by India. But then everything is hosted by India. It’s a year-round Indian season out there, from the Caribbean Premier League (six Indian owners) to the India-driven SA20, IPL, Indian-run Major League Cricket, India-powered Hundred.Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotion“Control means 10 different things to 10 different people,” Gidney declared last week, incorrectly. OK. How does this sound? The BJP is a political party led by Narendra Modi. Amit Shah is Modi’s oldest political ally. Jay Shah is head of the ICC and also Amit Shah’s son.There is no pretence here, no shadow dance of power. It’s all out in the open. The global interests of a sport played on every continent are dictated not just by a single nation, but by a single movement within that nation, an expression of one party’s nationalistic politics. And this is not a neutral entity. Amnesty International’s annual report details Indian government censorship and violence, the prosecution of Indian Muslims for acts such as prayer, eating beef and consensually marrying Hindu women.Cricket has already allowed itself to become a sports-washing engine for all this. So we get events like the 2023 World Cup, essentially a six-week election rally in a country where players such as Virat Kohli are happy to act as cheerleaders for the regime. We have the IPL, a fun competition, but one that has always felt like an expression of semi-delirious sporting nationalism, and a perfect example of what George Orwell called “mimic warfare”.This is before we even get on to the moment India’s cricketers turned out in camouflage caps for an ODI against Australia in 2019, literally playing cricket dressed up as soldiers. What happens if they do this next month? Anyone got the balls to have a word?It is a lesson for every sport, and for the world in general, a lesson in strongman-ism, a lesson in the way public spectacle is used to manipulate. Enjoy the summer. Try not to watch the news, except perhaps for the bit about how Jacob Bethell is now free to bat No 3 for England so everything’s fine.Power will always pull the world its way. But it is also worth remembering, as English cricket contorts itself around the requirements of its visiting overlords, that it is also possible to say no to the big stick and the big cheque; and to retain a little more than just the run of your own summer sport.",

            "content": "Last month, a few weeks into the random detentions and denied entries at the US border, I was supposed to go to Princeton University as a guest lecturer to discuss global fascism. I asked the professors who invited me whether they thought it was safe to come. When I was in Turkey, European journalist friends once similarly asked me whether they’d be detained. And just as I did then, the American professors hesitated with half sentences: “Well, you know … ” It was decided that a law firm should be involved. After some back and forth, the final assessment remained unsettlingly ambiguous: “A detention is unlikely, but we cannot be sure.” Eventually, to be on the safe side, we choose the online option.\n  In the end all was fine on the surface, but I know from being on the other side of this story that the silk thread-like connection between us humans had been cut. They felt their land a shade darker, and I felt like giving up on the unfortunate in dire times. After all, I should know: this is how a country drifts into darkness – not by a dictator’s orders but rather by the outside world abandoning its people to their own means, by cutting millions of the threads that hold us as humanity together.\n  Meanwhile, what began as a shocking absurdity – academics, intellectuals and ordinary people with ideas being denied entry or sent to prison for weeks based on the search of their phone – quickly became ordinary. The unacceptable was normalised at such speed that, only a few weeks into the border crisis, the EU began issuing burner phones to its staff bound for the US. Some European countries warned their LGBTQ+ citizens to be cautious visiting the US in a tone akin to Tripadvisor travel tips. The charade began without warning and continues with absolute randomness. Trouble finds people as described in the assessment of my likely difficulties: “unlikely but not for sure”. And in that unsettling ambiguity lies the unique feature of today’s fascism.\n  Many of us – writers, thinkers and politicians – try to come up with a catchy term for today’s fascism. At the heart of it, I have come to think, lies not only the desire to analyse but also the urge to attract people’s attention so they are adequately alarmed. It may be an all too human urge to think: “If only we could find the right word, people would stop and listen. Perhaps then they’ll do something.” In fact, it is good old fascism, only with many new spectacles and glamorous gadgets, like an updated app with new features. One of these new features of 21st-century fascism is being cloud-like. After all, it is the political child of cloud capitalism.\n  The term was coined by the Greek economist and politician Yanis Varoufakis. He says there is a new economic system where big tech companies, particularly those operating in the cloud, have replaced traditional capitalist pillars like markets and profit with platforms and rents. This system is characterised by the creation of digital fiefdoms in which individuals, or fiefs, labour for these platforms. It is like in medieval times, but a techno version. Nobody, of course, throws themselves into this new form of slavery, yet things seemingly happen as if ordained by the natural order.The term “cloud” reveals a lot about the world’s current reality. The cloudlike vagueness, fluidity and slipperiness of the system – its everywhereness but at the same time nowhereness – are quite like moving storm clouds. Right now it is in Turkey, operating through the imprisonment of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s political rivals; now it is in Israel, starving Palestinian children. After appearing on the Italian shores to push back refugees to the sea, it suddenly shows up in the US, raining on a new land through the border police. Cloud fascism has infinite hands committing unpredictable crimes with the randomness that we all try to catch up with and adapt to. Like the cloud fiefs, we get on with it. And after a short while we lose our ability to be shocked, unwillingly normalising the cloud, as if now it is a natural phenomenon we must live with. As if the cloud simply is. Just don’t take your phone with you to the US. Buy a burner. No big deal. If there is a cloud, get an umbrella and walk faster past those who do not have one.\n  The late Pope Francis called this umbrella attitude “global indifference”. He often referred to human dignity as the last defence line of human morality against the indignities of our present political and economic reality. As I perceive it, he didn’t mean only the dignity of the poor being broken by inequality. Dignity, as a central human value that unifies all of us, can be damaged in several other ways. Those who can afford the umbrellas to protect themselves from cloud fascism, who without any protest buy the burner phone, have their dignity broken too, even if they numb their heart not to feel it. The late pope didn’t stop at pointing out the wounded dignity of humanity; he alluded to civil resistance when he said that when the laws are not good enough, one can go against them to be on the side of the greater good.Finally, in Wim Wenders’s documentary about him, he said: “Revolution. Don’t be afraid of the word.” A word that for a while has been accompanied by a smirk or a sarcastic air-quote hand gesture even in progressive intellectual circles. That smirk is the sign of our loss of faith in humanity and the beginning of our submission to the darkest cloud. Whereas the pope smiled when uttering the word – big difference.This cloud of ours, this cloud fascism, is travelling the planet, showering us with acid rain. Yet each time it appears in a country, the citizens of the land behave as if it is the first time and only happening to them. The repeating astonishment marks the beginning of our retreat – and believing that a big enough umbrella, made solely for our nation, can save us is the dawn of our defeat. The question is whether we will blow away the cloud before the ultimate surrender. What stands between us, humanity and the dark cloud is the question of faith. Not in God, perhaps, but in the divinely joyous entity that materialises when people come together to defend their dignity. A cloud of resistance that is as random, fluid and unpredictable as cloud fascism. What can stop this acid rain is the everywhereness of the cloud resistance of human dignity. I am not saying revolution – well, after all, I am not the pope. May he rest in joy of dignity.Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish journalist and political commentator, and author of How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship",

A story about the power of stories. Jack SealeIt is surely undeniable that 1988 was one of the great pop years. Bros ruled the charts, but bubbling under were the likes of Neneh Cherry, Yazz, S’Express and Bomb the Bass.

PHLee Mack hosts another round of the show that says: “Facts: who needs them?” To ace this one, and bag up to £100,000, the contestants, increasingly whittled down from 100, need to employ “common sense” instead, to answer a question just 1% of the UK can get right.

            "content": "The pan of beans on my cooker have taken a long time to prepare. It’s not just because I soaked them overnight and have now simmered them for about an hour: more than 12 years has gone into the creation and production of these beans. After all that, they had better taste delicious.These beans are the creation of Prof Eric Holub, a geneticist and researcher at the University of Warwick, who has spent more than a decade developing three new varieties of beans, engineered to be grown in the UK.The three varieties of UK Registered Beans, or URBeans, are named Olivia, Godiva and Capulet, inspired by the Warwickshire region. They are the offspring of previous work by Holub, who has also developed rot-resistant alfalfa. He used mechanical pollination, by which pollen is transferred between two parent plants to create genetically optimised offspring.It might sound a bit sci-fi, but Holub assures me that these aren’t frightening beans. “There was nothing novel about the technology we used for this initiative, it’s been used for hundreds of years. It’s conventional breeding and genetics,” he said. “The key thing was what we were aiming for: a better bean.”Olivia, Godiva and Capulet can germinate fast and in cold soils, they have strong root systems and are suitable for planting in May and harvest in September – before the autumn rain sets in. They are also tall enough for a combine harvester to cut them down and harvest the seed pods. Capulet beans are small and white, perfect for beans on toast. Godiva is blonde and a little larger, and the Olivia beans are black.The next step after development was scaling up. A Warwickshire initiative, Nurtural Food, was launched to bring together local farmers, retailers and the bean makers, and the zero-waste Zero Store in Warwickshire agreed to stock the beans to see how they went down. They have been on the shelves for a year now, and Zero has recently transitioned to selling a new mixture of Olivia and Godiva.It helps that interest in beans is on the rise. “When we started this project, the timing wasn’t really right for these bean varieties,” said Holub. “The government was investing in a programme to produce alternative proteins, but that was really driven by a need to replace soybeans for animal food. The Eat-Lancet report recommending a shift to plant-based diets was years away, and knowledge about beans was stuck at beans on toast.”Now 23.4% of Britons consider themselves flexitarians while the focus on ultra-processed foods has made consumers more conscious about the contents of their “healthy” food and encouraged greater mindfulness about how food gets to our plates.And in case you hadn’t noticed, beans are cool these days. If you go to any specialty grocery store or even most supermarkets, part of the legume shelf will be occupied by big glass jars of beans, adorned with trendily designed labels. Meanwhile, influencers are going viral for their bean-based meal ideas such as the dense bean salad, a recipe formula that sparked headlines online and off.“More people are cooking from scratch, whether to save money or for pleasure or relaxation. All that means that consumer knowledge is changing,” Holub said. “Now if you look at a can of beans it will tell you about the protein and fibre content, that they’re low fat. The way we think about fibre particularly has changed – people are very interested in gut health.” From a climate-conscious perspective, many are also keen to source their ingredients from local, or at least UK, producers.Affordability was a key factor when the beans were in the early development stage. “There has to be a short supply chain,” Holub said. “Adding parties in the middle makes it more expensive for the consumer and means the farmer probably doesn’t get enough to be able to afford to grow the beans.”Obviously, the most important measure of success for the beans is how they taste. And they taste good. The mixture of Olivia and Godiva has an unexpected depth of flavour, a Pinto-esque nuttiness that worked well with the smoky tomato, lemon and garlic sauce I put together, and I felt strangely accomplished having made the beans as from-scratch as I could.It sounds a bit hippy, but really understanding where these little legumes came from and how they made it to my plate did add to the enjoyment of the meal. Although nationwide accessibility is a while off, the work of Holub and his team is an encouraging sign of British agricultural innovation.“The story isn’t just about beans on toast any more,” Holub said. “We’re creating a better bean for better meals, healthier communities, and a healthier nation.”",

            "content": "Bradford is so often portrayed as a city divided. Sometimes, those descriptions can be correct. It is a place swamped with economic instability and problems that run deep, but over the past week, and again this weekend, the two things that unite its many communities have risen to the fore.One is its football team. Bradford City, like the West Yorkshire city itself, have had their fair share of inauspicious moments, but their incredible escape from League Two last Saturday, scoring a 96th-minute winner to beat Fleetwood and secure automatic promotion for the first time this century, sparked jubilant scenes over the bank holiday weekend.More than 24,000 supporters attended that game and on Tuesday evening thousands gathered in Centenary Square to celebrate with the players. Perhaps it was fitting this happened in this week of all weeks because on Sunday supporters and players will meet in the same spot to remember the other thing that binds this city.It will be the 40th anniversary of the Valley Parade fire, when 56 supporters – 54 from Bradford, and two from Lincoln, the opponents on 11 May 1985 – lost their lives when the main stand caught ablaze. Hundreds more were injured. Thousands suffered mental scars that will never heal.It was supposed to be a day of celebration, with City parading the Third Division title they had won a week earlier. They have not won a division title since. The day has often been referred to as a forgotten tragedy, with questions about why it is not given the same level of coverage as others. But the people of Bradford – and indeed Lincoln – will never forget. Every year they assemble to remember and pay their respects. Bradford will stand together on Sunday, just as it did 40 years ago in an extraordinary show of unity.Oliver Evans will lead his seventh memorial service as Bradford City’s club chaplain. He was due to attend the game against Lincoln, but was unable to go. “I’d been to every home game that season,” he says. “I used to cut the grass for my dad and that day I’d not done it. My mates all turned up to go to the game, but Dad said I couldn’t because I hadn’t cut the grass.”Evans’s memories of that day do not end there. His father was a clergyman and faced a devastating task. “He was asked by the head of the ambulance service to receive the bodies at North Parade. I’d never heard him cry before. I heard him cry through the bedroom wall as he told my mum what happened.”Evans’s family were supported by their neighbours, the local community and many more. In the days that followed, Bradford’s spirit rose in a way nobody had seen before, with the bishop of Bradford reportedly travelling about 25,000 miles, making sure those affected received the appropriate pastoral care.“Manningham, the part of Bradford where the stadium is, already had a relatively strong south Asian population in 1985,” Evans says. “The people in those terraces around Valley Parade had no connection to football, but came out with cups of tea, blankets, water … anything the victims needed. I believe the whole city was touched by that day and it still is.”A disaster fund was created and within days it had raised more than £3.5m. Today, that figure equates to around £12m. It has supported the victims and their families but it also led to the creation of one of Bradford’s proudest institutions: the Bradford burns unit.It was the brainchild of Prof David Sharpe, who would pioneer the Bradford Sling, designed initially to help the victims of the fire and now patented and used worldwide. In 2010, Sharpe, the head of the unit, was due to retire. At the time Prof Ajay Mahajan was residing in Sweden, but looking for somewhere to call home. A trained plastic surgeon, he applied for the job. He has remained ever since and is acutely aware of how this disaster connects the city.“I knew of the Bradford Sling before I came to Bradford, but I didn’t know why it was called that,” he says. “You instantly learn when you come here what this means to people.”Now called the plastic surgery and burns research unit, it has helped research treatment for burns victims worldwide. When it faced financial hardship in 2009, £100,000 was raised to keep it alive. It has gone on to revolutionise burns treatment across the world.There have been countless initiatives from people of all ages to raise funds. The local fire service walked between Bradford and Lincoln and the teenager Georgia Taylor has raised thousands selling homemade ribbons for several years.“Bradford can be so proud of it,” Mahajan says of the unit. “Everyone feels like it belongs to them and it should feel like that because the research is only possible because of the spirit of Bradfordians. I know that day in 1985 everyone came together in the aftermath with their community spirit. It has changed lives worldwide, not just in Bradford.”Mike Harrison is editor of the City Gent, the longest-running fanzine in the UK. He was at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985 and one of many who helped. “I have mental scars, but we did anything and everything that summer. Sponsored walks, putting money in the box at the chippy … there was such a dark cloud over the city.“The good that came out of that tragedy, if that is such a thing, was the sense of community Bradford has. In its darkest times, it always rallies. We were in the news, but eventually something else takes the headlines. That is where Bradford as a city shone for me. We were left to look after ourselves, but we did that.”Perhaps the biggest point of pride, though, is how the tragedy resonates with those who were not born at the time. Supporters of all ages will be in Centenary Square, with stories of 1985 and the importance of it to the club and the city passed down through generations.“The community spirit of that day has paved forward to today,” Evans says. “Bradford is viewed nationally as the cousin in the family we’d rather not talk about. Last weekend was a city getting some of its pride back and Sunday will be the same. Thousands of people are there come rain or shine. But the thing that stands out is there are young families and young people who weren’t born and who will never let this be forgotten. It united our city 40 years ago, and it does the same today.”",

She was carted off the field with an oxygen mask on her face.Players from both teams gathered in a prayer circle, and the match was delayed 10 minutes.Angel City tweeted postgame, “Savy was transported by EMS to the hospital following a medical event on the field. She is responsive and undergoing further evaluation. We thank everyone for their concern and support.”Angel City assistant coach Eleri Earnshaw said following the team’s 2-0 victory, “Her family is with her, as is our medical staff, so she’s in good hands.”Utah coach Jimmy Coenraets said postgame, “In those moments, I’m not sure we should have continued the game. ... Not only them, but also our players were just scared. I think that’s not the right position and not the right situation to be in.“But in the end we played on, and that’s a decision that other people are making, which is fine. But I think it was a really tough moment.”King, 20, has been a starter for Angel City in all eight matches this season. She has no goals or assists and two yellow cards.The first-ever draft pick (second overall) of expansion Bay FC in 2024, King played 18 matches and made 12 starts last season for the San Jose-based club. She had two assists and one yellow card last year.The Southern California native played for the University of North Carolina before entering the NWSL.

            "content": "Australia’s highest-ranking Catholic has provided a rare insight into the process of electing the new pope, describing the secretive conclave as the highlight of his life.Cardinal Mykola Bychok – Australia’s sole representative at the recently concluded conclave in Rome – joked it was a relief to shut off the outside world for an extended period.“That was the best time of my life,” he told reporters with a smile on Friday afternoon, local time.“Just try … try to turn off your phone at least for 24 hours – my phone was turned off for two and a half days.”But he added the process did not resemble the Oscar-winning Hollywood film Conclave, which details the political machinations behind the selection of a fictional pope.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“I watched the movie, but actually it was controversial … especially about prayer,” Cardinal Bychok said.“Have you seen in this movie any of the cardinals pray? Not one time, which is Hollywood style.”The closeted event, which concluded in Rome on Thursday, resulted in the election of US-born Robert Prevost as the first American pope.Taking the name Pope Leo XIV, he is the first native English-speaker to be appointed to lead the Catholic faith.Only cardinals participate in the closed-door election process.The Ukraine-born, Melbourne-based Cardinal Bychok was appointed to his senior post by Pope Francis in 2024 after other senior Australian Catholic church leaders were controversially overlooked.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has invited Pope Leo to visit Sydney in 2028 for the International Eucharistic Congress - an event set to attract tens of thousands of Catholics from all over the world.It would be the first sovereign pontiff visit since Pope Benedict XVI came to Sydney for World Youth Day in 2008.Pope Leo made several previous visits to Australia as leader of the order of St Augustine and had already developed a fondness for the country, one Sydney-based church official said.“He loved being in the country,” the Pope’s long-time friend Father Tony Banks told Sky News.“He loved the beaches, among the things he actually liked was driving between Brisbane and Sydney and the distance.”Perth Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said he hoped the pontiff would also travel west.“If he comes, he’ll certainly go to Sydney ... but if I get to speak to him between now and then, I’ll certainly be inviting him to come to Western Australia,” he said.The archbishop said it was still unclear where the former missionary stood on various issues, but he described him as attentive and a deep listener.Sydney Archbishop Anthony Fisher said the Chicago native’s “missionary heart” would make him a unifier and peacemaker.",

            "content": "During my school years I was encouraged to believe that being gay was a serious medical handicap, like having one leg shorter than the other or a parent who was also your form tutor. This was during section 28, which outlawed the promotion of the “acceptability of homosexuality” in UK schools, when nearly half the population thought being gay was “always” or “mostly” wrong. “Gay” was a synonym for “shit”; a descriptor deployed when no other slur was low enough. Detentions were gay, as was double maths. Two men having sex was so gay that it was almost unspeakable, the closest analogue being supermarket-brand trainers.\n  Perhaps it’s inevitable that many men of my generation grew up with shame coating them like varnish. This lack of self-esteem is supposedly what drives many to chemsex, or self-harm, or sporting harnesses as daywear, which is effectively the same thing. Unfortunately, there was never any hiding my gayness. It shone out of me like a tea-light in a lantern, and the most I could hope to do was deflect (every queer kid knows the heart-stopping sensation that greets the sentence “can I ask you something?”). Aged 11, it was hard not to see being gay as a life sentence. Like prison, it felt inherently terrifying and degrading.\n  Then Queer As Folk appeared on Channel 4. The very mundanity of the conceit (gay men going to work, having one-night stands, falling in and out of love) made it feel revolutionary. For the first time I saw gay people living gay lives, rather than acting as plot devices or cautionary tales in straight people’s stories. They weren’t ostensibly glamorous (Vince worked in a supermarket) but existed on their own terms, which felt entirely exotic and thrilling. Stuart was unapologetic and reckless – memorably driving his Jeep through the glass storefront of a car dealership after overhearing a salesman brag about how much money he made from gay men who die young. It was Pretty Woman’s “big mistake” moment for men with a preferred Minogue.The show inspired controversy, with the Daily Mail claiming that “Any nation which allows this … [is] hell-bent on destruction.” Journalist Peter Hitchens appeared on BBC breakfast to bleat that it was propaganda aimed at persuading the public that “homosexuality was normal behaviour”. In my limited experience, normal behaviour meant football chants and Toby Carverys and South Park catchphrases. The characters on Queer As Folk weren’t normal. They were better. For the first time I wondered if my own difference could also be a gift, rather than a burden. Years later I would strongly identify with Tom Ford when he said that, growing up in America’s bible belt, “I thought I was fabulous and everyone else was stupid”. Queer As Folk gave me the permission to feel fabulous – or at least fabulous in waiting.\n  I’m not the type of person to bang on about “queer joy” – Instagram posts purporting to show it invariably feature blue-haired polycules milling about in dank warehouses – but Queer As Folk was joyful. As well as being funny, sad, poignant and sexy. At the risk of playing into the hands of homophobes who believe that queerness is a proselytising institution, watching the show made me glad to be gay. I began to come out, first to myself and then out loud. I wasn’t scared any more.\n  There would be unimaginable horrors to come (Trump’s current rowing back of LGBTQ+ policies, the advent of gay men going on “gym dates”) but Queer As Folk felt like the promise of a brighter future. A flare sent up into the sky to let me know that my rescue was imminent.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change? Email us at cultural.awakening@theguardian.com",

            "content": "Whitehall departments will be required to set out plans to move thousands of staff out of London as part of their bids to secure funding from the Treasury at the spending review.The proposal to relocate civil service jobs to a dozen towns and cities across the UK is aimed at bringing the development of government policy closer to the communities it affects.Around one in five – or 100,000 – civil servants are based in London, with about 70,000 working in the north-west of England. There are 513,000 full-time civil servants in central government, up sharply from a recent low of about 380,000 in 2016.The government claims the relocation plans could bring more than £700m of economic benefit to towns and cities including Leeds, Glasgow, Cardiff and Bristol by 2030.The ‘Places for Growth’ plan to move 22,000 officials outside the capital was first announced by Rishi Sunak as chancellor in 2020 as part of the Conservatives’ levelling up agenda.However, Labour has now picked up the scheme as part of its attempts to reform the state, which also include plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs, amid concerns the civil service had become too big and unwieldy after expanding with the demands of Brexit and the Covid pandemic.In an attempt to inject some urgency into the process, the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, will write to all Whitehall departments to tell them their funding allocation in June will be contingent on submitting their plans.Alongside the spending review, the first ever strategic workforce plan for the civil service will be published, looking at the size and shape of Whitehall and whether it is fit for modern government.“We’re keen to go further to enhance the impact of government in places across the country, so that the civil service has an active presence in communities across the UK and contributes to local growth and job creation,” a government source said.“The plans will see more roles working closer to frontline services, facilitating greater understanding of the real issues facing local services and people, and how central government policy can support them. Central government can’t solve the issues facing local communities from Whitehall alone.”Civil servants working in regional offices outside London will continue to be expected to spend at least three days a week in the office.The government is introducing greater use of performance-related pay for senior staff and improved performance management across the civil service, with fast-track exits for poor performers.",

            "content": "Your kids are the greatest love affair of your life, and that love is unconditional … Although wait, on second thoughts, there are a few conditions. No child must ever be allowed to take up the bagpipes, drums or descant recorder. Come meal times there are two options – spag bol or adoption. No mother should have to teach a child to drive while simultaneously going through the menopause. And, most important of all, progeny must be out the door by 24.Without a doubt, the two nicest words in the English language are “empty” and “nest”. And yet my kitchen is constantly full of female friends weeping into their wine about how much they will miss their kids when they leave for university, flat shares or gap year travels.Michelle Obama has joined the chorus, revealing that she’s going to counselling to help her adjust to life as an “empty nester” now that Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23, are fledging. On Jay Shetty’s podcast, the former first lady said: “I’m in therapy right now because I’m transitioning, you know? … I’m 60 years old, I’ve finished a really hard thing in my life with my family intact, I’m an empty nester, my girls are in – you know, they’ve been launched! … This is a whole other phase in life for me.”The difficulty with adjusting to this new phase is that the psychological umbilical cord is still firmly attached. For days after my kids flew the nest, I’ll admit I wandered around their bedrooms, touching old toys and storybooks, feeling totally bereft. The silence roared at me. But this ennui began to evaporate as I realised the redecoration potential. Would I turn their old bedrooms into a gym and a study, a craft area or a walk-in-wardrobe …?And that’s not the only joy. Imagine this for a moment – you open your cupboard and your clothes are not ransacked. Nor do they reek of beer fumes, bonfire smoke or rave sweat. Your expensive hair conditioner is not tipped over in the shower, dribbling slowly down the drain. You open your fridge and there is food. No lipstick marks on the milk bottle, or empty packets put back into the pantry. Plus there is nobody standing before that full pantry moaning “there’s nothing to eat in this house”. In fact, you can now hang up your cooking apron. Nesting mothers roast whole schools of salmon and flocks of lambs; now you can just wear your finger to the bone ordering take away.Your hairdryer is where you left it. As is your phone charger and TV remote. Your purse is full. Your car is where you parked it, and actually contains petrol. When you leave your pristine house for work in the morning, you do not come home to find a flotsam and jetsam of dropped wet towels, apple cores, bike helmets and random teenage school friends crashed out on your couch.Best of all, you can now have sex loudly. So as not to “give the ick” to embarrassed offspring, parents are forced to endure muffled sotto voce nooky, limiting expressions of enthusiasm to the odd strangled, asthmatic gasp. Well, now you can give full vocal vent to your joy. Michelle doesn’t need therapy; she needs to have sex in every room of her empty house – in the kitchen, on the landing, atop the washing machine. She and Barack need to run around the house naked. Yodelling. With antlers on their heads.When the Obama girls move out, yes, their empty bedrooms will yawn at Michelle. She won’t be able to walk past without a shiver of sadness and the odd sob. But rest assured, just when an empty nester is beginning to ponder colour charts, one kid will ring to say he’s popping home for the weekend for “some pampering”, and the other is planning on coming back to stay a few days later to do laundry and “pick up a few things”. Another bit of advice for Michelle – in the case of missing linen, postage stamps and vintage wine bottles, a parent has the right to search and seizure.So, if you’re a new empty nester, do not feel despondent about this next phase. You’ve hatched and dispatched. Give yourself a parenting medal, and now go make proper use of the kitchen counter.Kathy Lette is a comedy writer and novelist. Her latest book is The Revenge Club",

            "content": "For many young men, masculinity is sold as an obsession with protein, and a personality that answers the question “What if WWE was real, and all the time?” Which brings us to Netflix’s explosive new documentary. Untold: The Liver King (out Tuesday 13 May), real name Brian Johnson, is a fitness influencer who promotes “ancestral living” as the solution to enervating modernity. This includes a great deal of hollering and extreme workouts, saying the word “alpha” a lot, plus eating a carnivorous diet of raw animal organs, including an unfeasible amount of genitals.Liver King angry that people addicted to phones. Works with marketing agency to pump out stunt videos specifically designed for them. Opening shot shows Liver King pulling truck on chain. Famous caveman activity. Meanwhile, other men push truck from behind. Liver King knows not everyone can go full primal, so sells range of nutritional supplements that help bring in an annual income north of $100m. You’d think he would exclusively trade in shiny rocks, and in a sense he does.Having piously attributed his inhumanly buff, conker-y body to the benefits of eating dicks and going on podcasts, it is proved that Johnson has, in fact, been injecting steroids to the tune of more than $11,000 a month. He does so on screen. He subsequently confesses to a lifetime of grifter behaviour, each extraordinary chapter of which could warrant its own deep dive.The trajectory is inevitable – but Untold: The Liver King has an ace up its sleeve. It’s so funny. “Why eat vegetables when you can eat testicles?” is his mantra. He describes his first orgasm, a spontaneous ejaculation while bench pressing. We feel the film-makers’ delight in their subject, who has more quotable moments than the book of Psalms. “Where does oxygen come from?” Johnson asks his sons, who are invariably checked out or laughing at him. “Wind.”The Hulk Hogan cartoon fun of it all is complicated by the implications of its reality. Johnson is demonstrably a moron, inveterate liar, a parody of an influencer and paragon of toxic masculinity. The latter, literally. In one disturbing scene, he instructs his teenage sons to dissect a dying bull in a field and eat its pumping organs. You can almost taste the salmonella and E coli. It’s jaw-dropping, but I’d advise you to close your mouth.His relationship with his “weak” children, Rad “Ical” Johnson and Stryker “the Barbarian” Johnson is the central heartache. Johnson exhorts Stryker to pronounce the word “steak” with more guttural emphasis. Stryker doesn’t tell his parents when he has broken his leg, knowing they scorn pain medication. The boys eat 15 raw eggs a day, and it is revealed a woman from child protection services pays regular visits. “She’s like: ‘Why am I here? These kids are awesome,’” boasts the deluded patriarch. The Liver King’s originating grief is that his father died when he was a year old; he remains blind to the fact he has robbed his own children of a stable father figure. They could have called this Flesh Man Is in Trouble.Similar streamer offerings, such as Devil in the Family, split their arc across three episodes or more. The Liver King is a tight 70 minutes, all protein, and leaves one wishing it were longer. The sly wit of director Joe Pearlman shines through, fusing elements of Tiger King, Spinal Tap and classical tragedy. As the sun sets, the show teasingly invites us to question crucial elements of what has gone before – well-structured documentaries and online videos sharing, as they do, a few narrative tricks.Sign up to What's OnGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Mondayafter newsletter promotionStories of influencers melting down cannot help but be modern parables; they are the hollow totems of what we value. Scandal only damages those who have shame. The documentary leaves an upbeat Johnson who has metabolised his experience, and believes his reign is just beginning. He has turned his ranch into a produce store and meeting place for any “primals” who still believe in his message. “People say why don’t you have a retreat, something like that?” says Johnson. “We’re gonna have 302 of ’em.” Long live the king.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/10/carla-denyer-accuses-labour-of-failing-to-challenge-reform-uks-net-zero-lie",
            "content": "The Labour government is standing back and letting Reform UK “sell the lie” that net zero will harm working people, Carla Denyer, the Greens’ co-leader has said as she prepares to step back from the role she has held for four years.Denyer, who will not contest this summer’s party leadership re-election process, told the Guardian that she wanted to focus on her Bristol Central constituency, and to campaign on particular issues, including a net zero policy shaped to the needs of workers.Next week, she plans to table a private member’s bill setting out “just transition” to net zero. While it has no chance of getting the parliamentary time required to pass, Denyer said she wanted to try to seize the initiative back from Nigel Farage’s party.“At a time like this, when Reform are unfortunately managing to sell the lie that tackling climate change is somehow going to be bad for ordinary people, it’s really important that we Greens challenge that – and I am worried the Labour government is backsliding on climate policy,” Denyer told the Guardian.While Keir Starmer has publicly defended net zero targets, Denyer pointed to repeated speculation about the position of Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, and comments by Tony Blair that the strategy to phase out fossil fuels was “doomed to fail”.“My worry at the moment is that the government are sort of lurching from crisis to crisis on this,” Denyer said.“One of the real responsibilities and opportunities of having four Green MPs in parliament is that we can hold the government to account on climate and nature policies, and make the case really strongly that tackling the climate crisis absolutely can and should be done with people, not to people, and they need to plan their industrial strategy on that basis.”Her bill will set out that net zero plans must be agreed with workers, and that every UK-listed company in the oil and gas industries must come up with a transition plan to meet emissions targets, which would include training or redeployment for staff.Denyer’s decision not to stand again breaks up the Greens’ most electorally successful leadership duo. She and Adrian Ramsay, who is also now an MP, took over in 2021 with the stated aim of building up the party’s base of MPs and councillors. Two years later, they spelled out the four Westminster seats to be targeted – all of which were won.“I definitely don’t claim sole credit, but yes, in mine and Adrian’s time as co-leaders, we’re very proud of our record,” Denyer said. “We stood for election on a platform of getting the Green party into a serious election-winning machine, and we’ve achieved that.”Shortly before Denyer announced her intention not to stand again, Zack Polanski, the Greens’ deputy leader, said he was challenging her and Ramsay for the leadership of the party in England and Wales.While Polanski praised their record, he implicitly criticised their approach as too cautious, saying the Greens should be more combative, and seek to become a mass membership “eco-populism” movement.Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionDenyer, who argued her style had been less cautious than “relentlessly focused”, pushed back slightly against this argument, while accepting that the Greens had “been on a bit of a journey in terms of how we communicate our ideas effectively”.Recent Green electoral success, she said, “shows people do appreciate that the Green party does politics differently – and broadly speaking I don’t think most Brits like the kind of politics where they’re just watching politicians taking chunks out of each other”.As well as net zero, Denyer plans to campaign for more social housing and rent controls for private tenancies, and to help the party further build up its Westminster base.While refusing to predict how many MPs the Greens could win at the next election, Denyer noted that the party had not just won four seats last July but came second in 40 more:“Adrian and I are clear that it is absolutely possible for Greens to succeed in the system we’ve got. We’ve demonstrated that over the last four years, and I think that there is every possibility that we can make further significant gains at all levels of government over the next few years.”",

            "content": "Decades of economic orthodoxy failed millions of Americans, according to Donald Trump, who marched back into the White House promising to shred the status quo. But the specifics of his alternative – exactly how his administration claims it will make America great again – change by the day.The US president declared this week to be a key milestone of his second term, as he unveiled his first major trade deal since returning to office following accelerated talks with the UK.But it came as Trump’s position, on everything from tariffs on strollers and movies to whether his administration even wants to strike such global deals, appeared to shift by the hour.Firms across the world have been trying to come to terms with the rapid rate of presidential kneejerks: where policies can be announced, adjusted and shelved as quickly as the leader of the free world can publish a social media post.“There’s so much uncertainty,” Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair (and persona non grata in Trumpworld), observed on Wednesday. “If you talk to businesses, or market participants, or forecasters, everyone is just waiting to see how developments play out.”Take strollers. This was the week when Trump argued that some prices are more important than others.After pledging to bring down prices, the president was keen to focus on those that had fallen during an NBC News interview that aired last weekend. His interviewer, however, observed that some had risen: with an estimated 97% of strollers bought in the US made in China, for example, prices have risen significantly since Trump hiked tariffs dramatically on the country.The president was having none of it. The (declining) price of fuel is “thousands of times more important than a stroller”, he asserted. Later in the interview, he demanded more positive questions. “Because you know what? Gasoline’s big business,” he said. “A stroller is not big business.”On Sunday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Sure, strollers might be more expensive – but “that’s peanuts” in the grand scheme of things. Other costs are thousands of times more important.By Wednesday, the administration was moving in a different direction. Potential tariff exemptions for childcare and baby products – like car seats, cribs and, yes, strollers – were “under consideration”, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Congress.Then there was movies. This was also the week when Trump emphatically stood up for Hollywood.The president abruptly announced his concern that Hollywood was “DYING a very fast death” over the weekend. A 100% tariff would be imposed upon “any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands”, he wrote on Truth Social.Many US blockbusters are produced, shot and edited in a variety of countries. There was no detail as to how the policy would be executed. It was unclear which films would and would not face tariffs.Sign up to Trump on TrialStay up to date on all of Donald Trump’s trials. Guardian staff will send news and updates directly to your inbox.after newsletter promotionBut on Sunday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Hollywood had been “devastated” by the rise of movie production elsewhere; this amounted to a national security threat; and US officials would immediately start work on steep tariffs.By Monday, the administration was moving in a different direction. The White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “no final decisions” had been made, and the administration was “exploring all options”.And take deals. This was also the week when Trump, author of Trump: The Art of the Deal, announced he was done with them.On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised to negotiate agreements that would end wars and tilt the world economy in his country’s favor. But earlier this week, surrounded by cameras in the Oval Office, the president complained the media had become fixated.“You keep writing about deals, deals,” he told reporters. “I wish they’d stop asking ‘how many deals are you signing this week?’ because one day, we’ll come and we’ll give you a hundred deals. And they don’t have to sign.“And I think my people haven’t made it clear,” said the president. While the US will sign “some deals”, tariffs were a “much bigger” focus. Overseas companies “are going to have to pay to shop” in the US, he added. “Think of us as a super luxury store.”On Tuesday, the message could hardly have been clearer. Trade deals were not the be-all and end-all. The US will make demands of trading partners, and unless they agree, it will continue to hit them with sweeping tariffs.By Thursday, the administration was moving in a different direction. Unveiling a “maxed-out deal that we’re going to make bigger”, Trump declared that a trade accord with the UK would be just the first.In reality, the UK-US deal was unfinished. The announcement felt hasty: the diplomatic equivalent of hosting a wedding reception after the engagement, but before the ceremony. Both Trump and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, conceded certain details had yet to be finalized.But the president was off – “many Trade Deals in the hopper, all good (GREAT!) ones,” he wrote on Truth Social the following day – which brings us to China.No economy has been targeted more aggressively, or hit harder, by this administration. Trump has insisted any pain, be it higher prices or empty shelves, would be worth bearing as Washington pushed back hard against Beijing. “IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,” he wrote of his tariff strategy in February.Trump sparked a trade war between the world’s two largest economies by ramping up US tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting swift retaliation. “They deserve it,” he told ABC News last week. “They were ripping us off like nobody’s ever ripped us off.”But today, the administration appears to be moving in a different direction. Bessent has been dispatched to Geneva to negotiate with Chinese officials.The president, who has for months maintained that the US must hold the line against China, stressed the treasury secretary was leading these talks – but threw in his two cents. “80% Tariff on China seems right,” he wrote on Truth Social, proposing a drastic reduction. “Up to Scott B.”What happens next is anyone’s guess. But it’s safe to say it probably won’t be up to Scott B.",

And David Tennant – as charismatic-but-dastardly TV boss Lord Tony Baddingham – is the show’s rioter-in-chief. In person, the 54-year-old is as charming as his character (if less wicked) – often hooting with laughter to emphasise a point. Rivals isn’t the Scottish actor’s first go at playing the bad guy. While the multi-award-winner is most famous for his stint in Doctor Who, he won an Emmy for his appearance as serial killer Dennis Nilsen in ITV’s Des and starred as a cheeky demon, alongside Michael Sheen, in Good Omens on Prime Video. Series one of Rivals ended with him getting walloped on the head with a TV award, but he promises he’s coming back for Rivals series two.Were you expecting Rivals to be as massive as it was?\n I wasn’t, but my wife was. She said that before she’d read the script! Jilly Cooper’s writing has always had a fanbase, but I guess now there’s enough distance from the 1980s that it’s also a period drama.It looked like a fun shoot. Who was the biggest troublemaker on set?\n It would be very inelegant of me to be pointing fingers, wouldn’t it? But it was a very social bunch. Sometimes, that was problematic the next day, but everyone turned up and did their job.Last time we saw Tony, he’d just been hit over the head. Is that the end for him or are you coming back for season two?\n I mean, it would be quite a weird way to end, wouldn’t it? Maybe you could start season two with the funeral? But we start shooting the day after the Baftas. I don’t know what that means for me on that first morning.Could it be a hungover start?\n It might be, yeah!Did you base Tony Baddingham on anyone?The only example I could think of, who was a television executive with braces and smoke cigars, was Michael Grade. I read his autobiography in preparation. I don’t think it particularly helped. I think he’s probably a more balanced, better human than Tony Barrington is.The series had some racy scenes. Were there any awkward moments?\n Anything that involves imitating an intimate experience is not my most comfortable place. Things that are – quite rightly – put in place for safety sometimes make the whole thing a little ridiculous. The modesty pouches!The 1980s world of Rivals is fuelled by money, power and ruthless media moguls. How has that changed today?\n When Jilly wrote it, it was the world as she experienced it. Now, we can enjoy the awfulness of the way things were, because we can be slightly smug in the fact that it’s not quite as awful as it was then.You’ve presented the film Baftas for the past two years. At the most recent, you made a joke about Donald Trump being a villain. Were you nervous to do that in a room full of Americans?\n Should I have been? It’s a funny world – what you’re allowed to say and what you’re not, and what becomes a headline and what doesn’t. You can’t quite predict it. You’re suddenly aware of things you would never have thought twice about, satirical swipes that you might have made without imagining they had consequences beyond a punchline. That feels like it’s being weaponised in all sorts of debates.At another awards ceremony last year, you called for Kemi Badenoch to ‘shut up’ on the matter of transgender rights, and it led to a media frenzy. She brought you up again after the supreme court ruling about the definition of womanhood. Is it weird to you that the comment caused such a conversation?\n  It’s very helpful not being on social media, because that’s where, if someone criticises something you’ve said, it can feel like a pile-on and it can feel bigger than it probably is, which probably discourages people from saying things. Because that’s part of the point, isn’t it, that people are terrorised into not holding opinions – the idea that we can be silenced.You’re executive producing and starring in The Hack, about the phone-hacking scandal. What’s the most shocking thing you learned?\n  Oh God, it’s a minefield to talk about, as you can imagine; lawyers from every side of the debate are poring over anything that is said. But the whole thing was a shocker.I saw a story recently about bookies betting that Ncuti Gatwa was going to leave Doctor Who and be replaced by you. Is there any truth to that?\n Ha, nobody’s told me that!Are you protective of the doctors that have come after you, having seen what Jodie Whittaker and Gatwa faced?\n These debates – and it’s not even a debate, it’s a small clutch of people shouting very loudly, amplified by certain elements of the press – are not reflective of what most people feel. Things become ludicrously disproportionate, and end up being unnecessarily cruel. That’s what the trans debate seems to have become. Most people don’t give a shit. I genuinely believe most people just want to let people be themselves. All they’re doing is making a tiny portion of society who have a really tough time anyway have an even tougher time.What’s your guilty pleasure show?\n I love The Masked Singer. And The Traitors was just glorious.

            "content": "Ryanair has become the latest low-cost airline to offer a yearly membership scheme that promises benefits such as free reserved seats and cheap flights – but the consumer group Which? says you should look at the small print before you join.The low-cost carrier’s Prime membership costs £79 a person a year and promises 12 free seat reservations, travel insurance, and monthly access to a sale. However, the terms and conditions show a number of limitations.Ads for the new membership scheme boast “free reserved seats” but this is limited to free reservations only on specially designated seats. If there are none left, members have to take a randomly allocated seat or if they want to choose a different seat, they will be charged (minus what the Prime seat costs).The travel insurance only covers trips involving a Ryanair flight and the medical protections are not available for people aged over 70.The airline promises access to “12 member-only seat sales” but the details of how these differ from the regular seats sales Ryanair offers are unclear. The current membership sale for May promises “£50 off return flights”.The discounted fares are only available to people who hold the membership, the T&Cs state, and members have to be over 18. So if someone is booking for a family, the children would not be able to get the better rates nor would they be able to sit in the member seats.Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, says people should “think twice” before committing.“The service is full of caveats when it comes to seat selection, while Ryanair’s travel insurance offers poor cover compared with cheaper policies that are rated highly by Which?,” Boland says.“There’s little detail on Ryanair’s exclusive deals for Prime subscribers, or how they would differ from the many offers and deals Ryanair already sends out to customers or features on its website.”Other low-cost airlines also offer membership schemes. Wizz has four different layers of its Discount Club (priced €60/£51 to €385/£327 a year), which gives discounts on flights, and free cabin bags and priority boarding depending on how much you pay. Between one and five companions can get the membership benefits depending on which scheme you join.EasyJet Plus (£249 a person) promises premium seats, a dedicated bag drop area, speedier boarding, allowance for overhead cabin bags and free switches to earlier return flights. Access to fast-track security at some airports is another feature as well discounts on food and drink bought on board. Benefits are just for the member but partners can be added (for £215) and children under 16 (£155).",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/10/bicester-village-30-oxfordshire-shopping-mall",
            "content": "Before a shopping centre selling past-season designer fashion at discounted prices opened its doors in April 1995, the site of Bicester Village had been “a wet field containing two old horses that looked ready for the knacker’s yard, and a fallen-down shed behind a small branch of Tesco”, remembers Colin Woodhead, a PR director who worked on the launch. “We might as well have been a Martian spaceship that had landed on that field.”The timing of a retail concept then unknown in Britain was not auspicious. Three months later, the launch of an online bookseller called Amazon fired the starting pistol for a race toward internet shopping that would leave high streets half-empty and shopping centres boarded up.But Bicester Village has defied the downward trend of bricks-and-mortar retail to celebrate its 30th anniversary at almost 100% occupancy, and with a waiting list for pop-up spaces.Last year, it had a record 6.7 million visitors. It generates among the highest sales per square foot of any shopping centre in the world, and boasts the world’s only cut-price Dior store and biggest Pret a Manger. The Oxfordshire mall is the flagship of a global empire that includes two outposts in China, Bicester Village Shanghai and Bicester Village Suzhou.The average visitor spends six hours on site. “What Bicester proves is that it pays to offer something you can’t get on Amazon. It’s a whole day out,” says Sarah Montano, a professor of retail marketing at the University of Birmingham.While town centres struggle with environmental issues ranging from the cost of car ownership to refuse collection, the white picket fences and wide cobblestone avenues of Bicester Village – modelled on Disneyland – offer an environment akin to that of an all-inclusive holiday resort. Visitors are referred to as guests, rather than shoppers.“It is about the value of our time,” says Dr Antonia Ward at the trends intelligence firm Stylus. “Not just about how to save time, but about how to spend time in a way that feels meaningful. That can give an edge to a social, bricks and mortar shopping experience.”As Montano points out, “everyone loves a bargain”.With a cost of living crisis starting to bite for consumers, outlet shopping is an attractive alternative, says Rachel Gwyther, a senior strategist at WGSN. “A challenging macro environment is changing the meaning of value to consumers, with shoppers increasingly inclined to spend more to save in the long term.”At Bicester Village, Polo Ralph Lauren Alston penny loafers, £219 at full price, cost £153.Montana says: “Food is really important to people now, and Bicester have invested thoughtfully in the sort of food outlets people really want to go to.”She points to the appeal of Humble Crumble, makers of a TikTok-famous apple crumble (£7), whose only outlet outside London is in Bicester Village. Other food retailers include Itsu and La Tua Pasta, which offers a black truffle and ricotta tortelloni.Ward says: “It’s not just about food – people these days want screen time. They want a coffee and to scroll through their phone.”The rise of the secondhand and vintage market is boosting the status of outlet shopping. Off-price retail selling previous collections at a markdown were once fashion’s grubby secret, consigned to unsignposted out-of-town warehouses.But as the trend cycle has lost its stranglehold on the consumer psyche, and the rise of preloved and vintage has elevated the cachet of clothes that are not hot off the catwalk, the status of outlet shopping has risen.Ward says: “Preloved has got us excited about clothes being new-to-us rather than being new-new. And the interest in vintage has elevated the status of past-season clothes – there is real cachet in having a vintage piece, especially if you know when something came out.”Bicester Village is the second most popular British destination for Chinese tourists after Buckingham Palace. About half of visitors from China visited Bicester last year, and station announcements in Mandarin and Arabic speak to the global nature of the clientele.Last year, the investment fund L Catterton, which counts the luxury brands group LVMH as a shareholder, bought a 42% stake in Value Retail, which operates Bicester Village, in a £1.5bn deal. John Durnin, Bicester’s business director, describes his goal as “reshaping the traditional shopping experience”.But Bicester’s success is not necessarily transferable to value retailers, says Montano. “It’s not going to work for Primark. But for a mid or premium customer, it is a very aesthetic, pleasant environment. It’s a kind of hyperreality – a nostalgic vision of a perfect high street. They have nice toilets and it is flat, so it is entirely accessible.”Ward highlights initiatives among US retailers including Walmart and J Crew attempting to harness a social aspect to online shopping. “That experience of trying on a new outfit and showing it to your friends still happens – it just happens on social media rather than in a changing room.“Malls got a bad rap, because they became a place where groups of teenagers hung out. But people miss shopping together.”",

            "title": "Aphids plaguing UK gardens in warm spring weather, says RHS",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/10/aphids-uk-gardens-warm-spring-weather-plants",
            "content": "Aphids are plaguing gardeners this spring due to the warm weather, with higher numbers of the rose-killing bugs expected to thrive in the UK as a result of climate breakdown.The sap-sucking insects have topped the ranking of gardener queries to the Royal Horticultural Society, with many of its 600,000 members having complained of dozens of aphids on their acers, roses and honeysuckle plants.They thrive in warm, dry weather, exacerbated by climate breakdown. Additionally, they can be killed off by frost, and the change in weather patterns is making frost less regular.Hayley Jones, the principal entomologist at the RHS, said: “Climate change and more pronounced warm spells in many parts of the country could be a boon for some of the 500 species of aphid found in the UK, but there are other factors at play, including predator populations, the effect of climate change on general plant health and temperature swings and extremes.”Aphids are also spreading to plants they never used to feed on in the UK. The RHS is calling on gardeners to support research into an aphid that has only recently affected buddleia, causing distinctive distortion to the leaves. It is asking the public to submit information on the RHS website to help map its spread.There are more than 500 species of aphid found in UK gardens, and they are commonly known as blackfly, greenfly and plant lice. They can be red, yellow, black, green, brown or pink insects and feed by sucking sap from plants. They can significantly harm their host plants, causing death in some circumstances, but also cause distorted growth, sooty mould and can transmit plant viruses.Aphids, despite causing annoyance to many gardeners, are an important part of the garden food chain, and are fed on by birds, earwigs, ladybirds and other larger insects. However, when their population booms and there are not enough predators, they can get out of control and cause visible damage to plants.This is happening this spring, the RHS says, which recommends manual removal while predator numbers catch up. The charity is also finding environmentally friendly ways to manage aphids as does not recommend using harmful pesticides.One RHS trial involves growing poached egg plant (Limnanthes douglasii) alongside cabbages to determine if this encourages predatory hoverfly larvae, and installing earwig shelters in the RHS Garden Wisley orchard.The results are expected next year and, if successful, the RHS will encourage widespread use of these methods.Jones added: “Aphid biology means they are well-placed to make the most of a warm spring; aphids are a bit like Russian dolls, being born pregnant with the next generation so their populations can bloom rapidly.“Understanding how they can be managed through simple planting choices or encouragement of natural predators will help minimise damage and potential plant losses while maintaining a healthy garden ecosystem.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 07:00",
            "content": "In Great Yarmouth there are some signs of regeneration: the vast glass palace of the Winter Gardens is being refurbished and the ornate Cafe 1903 next to the historic Hippodrome is busy. But the bustling tourist industry of the Edwardian era is long gone. “When Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show came in 1903, the tent held 5,000,” says local historian Roger Silver. “A couple of years earlier the Bass Brewery brought 10,000 workers on a day trip from Burton upon Trent. It took 16 trains.”Coincidentally, that is the same number of visitors who poured into the Italian mountain village of Roccaraso (population 1,500) in January, drawn by the presence of Tik Tok influencer Rita de Crescenzo. But the similarities end there. The Yarmouth invasion received no complaints, while the residents of Roccaraso reacted with horror. The mayor, Francesco Di Donato, threatened to call in the army.What was once a holiday crowd, it seems, is now overtourism. “It has overwhelmed some of Europe’s most popular destinations,” says Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, whose new report details the powerful pressure that visitors are having on destinations around the continent. The award for most tourist-crowded resort goes to the Greek island of Zante (Zakynthos) where overnight stays outnumber residents 150 to one. Elsewhere, Mallorca takes the prize for most overnight stays while Paris tops the tourist density index with a whopping 418,000 stays per sq km – vastly surpassing its nearest rival, Athens.“It’s clear that some feel a tipping point has been reached,” says Boland. “The negative side of a booming tourist trade – whether that’s increasing house prices, antisocial behaviour or pressure on local services – is outweighing the benefits.”The term “overtourism” may be relatively new but, as Prof Richard Butler of the University of Strathclyde points out: “Complaints about the impacts of crowds of tourists go back well over a century, certainly in the case of Venice at least.” For some destinations, he argues, the real issue is undesirable behaviour and nuisance. “Long-established places like Blackpool, Las Vegas and Orlando do not appear to experience complaints of overtourism. They essentially grew up with tourism being the only game in town, and their growth and focus has always been on tourism.”The problem is in locations that are new to the experience, and for whatever reason cannot cope. Old cities such as Dubrovnik and Prague are suffering. But sometimes, Butler argues, the wounds can be self-inflicted. “Barcelona is one of the major sites of overtourism complaints to the media,” he says. “But it deliberately focused on tourism as a source of redevelopment, kicking off with the 1992 Olympic Games.”Marketing campaigns can be slow to adjust. The second most crowded tourist resort in Europe, according to the Which? report, is Istria in Croatia, still regularly referred to as the country’s “best-kept secret”. Which? suggestions of how best to avoid the crowds focus largely on eastern European destinations that get few visitors: Rybnik in Poland, Severoistočen in North Macedonia and parts of Romania.Mircea Crisbășanu, who operates biking tours in Romania, says the south is very quiet. “Some villages have beautiful traditional architecture and the people are very friendly.”The least visited option in all of Europe, with zero visitors, is the Norwegian island of Jan Mayen. Being well inside the Arctic Circle and with special permission required to visit, it remains an unlikely holiday destination.Back in Great Yarmouth, Roger Silver is standing on the Haven Bridge looking down quaysides that once hummed with activity. “We would love more cruise ships,” he says, a little wistfully.Sign up to The TravellerGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidaysafter newsletter promotionHighest tourist pressure (tourists per 1,000 residents) \n Zante (Zakynthos), Greece: 149,887\n Istria county, Croatia: 133,467\n Fuerteventura, Canary Islands: 118,720Lowest tourist pressure (tourists per 1,000 residents)Targovishte, Bulgaria: 332\n Rybnik, Poland: 351\n Benevento, Italy: 398Highest number of tourists per sq km\n Paris: 418,280\n Central Athens: 88,535\n Copenhagen: 63,944Lowest number of tourists per sq kmJan Mayen, Norway: 0\n Teleorman, Romania: 1.21\n Svalbard, Norway: 2.4Most overnight stays\n Mallorca: 51,193,029\n Paris: 43,919,010\n Rome: 41,135,744Least overnight stays\n Jan Mayen: 0\n Teleorman: 6,983\n Zasavska, Slovenia: 22,990",

            "content": "The odds were against Edgar Feuchtwanger reaching the age of 100. He was born on 28 September 1924 into a time of poverty and political turmoil in post-first world war Germany. He was also born into a Jewish family in a society that was about to turn to National Socialism, an ideology that would ultimately be responsible for the murder of 6 million Jews. In 1929, when Feuchtwanger was five, something happened that made his long life even more unlikely. He got a new neighbour: Adolf Hitler.In October that year, Hitler moved into the grand second-floor flat at Prinzregentenplatz 16 in Munich. His previous flat, on the other side of the Isar, the river that divides Munich, had become too small. Munich to him was the “Capital of the Movement”, a title he awarded the city officially in 1935. From 1929 on he lived in nine rooms in this corner building, with its long balconies and baroque facade. His staff moved in with him, and, soon, devotees and high-ranking SS officers were flocking to the flats nearby. Diagonally opposite, at Grillparzerstrasse 38, with a direct view of Hitler’s flat, lived the Feuchtwanger family.Edgar Feuchtwanger, whom his parents called Bürschi, grew up in a respected and wealthy family that employed a chef and a nanny. His father, Ludwig, was a publisher and lawyer; his mother, Erna, a pianist. Intellectuals of the early 20th century were constantly in and out of the family home: the writer Thomas Mann; the lawyer Carl Schmitt, who later became a Nazi legal theorist and party member. And, of course, Ludwig’s brother, and Edgar’s uncle, Lion Feuchtwanger, the author of the novels Jew Süss and Success.Hitler and the Feuchtwangers lived across the street from each other for years – until the family emigrated to England in 1939, just before the outbreak of the second world war. “Nowadays, I am perhaps the only living witness who saw and experienced Hitler directly and had some kind of contact with him,” says Feuchtwanger.We are sitting in Feuchtwanger’s living room in his home near Winchester in Hampshire. The sun shines through the large window, directly on to him, and he must be incredibly warm in his suit, complete with shirt and tie. He is of the generation that dresses smartly for appointments like this, his daughter Antonia Cox tells me. Sitting on the sofa, he doesn’t look 100 years old. But he doesn’t hear so well any more, and needs a walking frame to get around and a wheelchair for longer distances. Cox and her brother Adrian Feuchtwanger have warned me that he will need to take regular breaks during our interview.We talk in German. The stories he tells me are a mixture of his own experiences and those told to him by his parents. Some things he no longer remembers. He has forgotten, for example, that he stood in Hitler’s flat in Munich around 10 years ago, but Cox is there to help him out. The apartment has been a police station since 1949, to prevent it becoming a pilgrimage site for old Nazis and neo-Nazis. Feuchtwanger visited it and looked out through the window at the flat where his family once lived. Other things he remembers very clearly. The years when he lived opposite Hitler are deeply embedded in his memory. Twelve years ago, with the French journalist Bertil Scali, he wrote everything down in his book Hitler, My Neighbour.The Feuchtwangers first noticed that they had a new neighbour because of one banal detail: their morning delivery of milk was missing. Hitler, the milkman explained to Edgar’s mother, had claimed most of it for himself. He presumably needed it for his SS bodyguards.As a five-year-old, did he even know who Hitler was? “Well, I knew that this was a man who was not very – how should I put it?– well disposed towards us as Jews. He had already tried to come to power in Munich in the so-called Beer Hall Putsch, in 1923,” says Feuchtwanger. On the evening of 8 November, Hitler and his brownshirts stormed into the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich, declared the government of the German Reich dismissed and called for revolution. The putsch failed. Hitler was arrested, charged with high treason and sentenced to five years in prison in April 1924. He was granted early release at the end of the year, having started work on Mein Kampf.In the Feuchtwanger household, Hitler was spoken of as a “ridiculous figure” because of this failed coup, Feuchtwanger remembers. “People believed that Hitler was a temporary phenomenon,” he says. In particular, his uncle Lion wavered between feeling alarmed and remaining calm. In his satirical novel Success, which he published in 1930, Lion portrays Hitler as a hysterical man named Kutzner who tries to seduce the people with nationalist ideas but ultimately fails. “Although he regarded Hitler as very dangerous, he saw him as someone to be made fun of. Hitler was supposed to continue as a ridiculous figure and then he would somehow disappear from the scene,” Feuchtwanger says.Did his father, Ludwig, urge Lion not to write this book? “I don’t know whether he actually advised him against it, but he certainly didn’t want my uncle to put himself in even more danger. It was a matter of luck that Lion was on a reading tour in America when Hitler became Reich chancellor in 1933. Fortunately, the German ambassador there was not a Nazi. He realised immediately that my uncle couldn’t go back to Germany; he would have been killed.” Lion, who had also publicly mocked Mein Kampf, was one of the first to be stripped of his citizenship by the National Socialists, and his books were banned and burned.Soon, Feuchtwanger’s parents spoke of nothing but politics and the danger posed by Hitler. Did he feel threatened, I ask. “Well, nobody actually knew that it would become so threatening until it really did. As a child, I grew up very sheltered.” Everything seemed rather harmless to him, Feuchtwanger says. Hitler and National Socialism remained an abstract threat. He saw Hitler’s silhouette in the flat opposite, as the cars drove up and chauffeured him to the Berghof, his residency near Berchtesgaden. “Whenever I went to school, I had to pass the house of his photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, where Hitler was often in the garden. He was lying in a deckchair. So it all seemed quite – how should I put it – normal and unthreatening.”It was in 1933, when Adolf Hitler had just become Reich chancellor, that Feuchtwanger met him face to face for the first time. “Down from Prinzregentenplatz you could go out on to the meadows, get some fresh air, which was of course always important to the nannies. Once, when we were on our way, Hitler had just come out of his house. There was a car that he obviously wanted to get into and he saw that we had stopped to let him pass and he thanked us.” Until then, he had only ever seen him from a distance. Now he was standing in front of him. “He was actually just an ordinary person. There was nothing special about him,” Feuchtwanger says.That was the only time he met him up close? “Yes, and he didn’t know who we were then. He just saw a woman with a small boy.” Hitler was unaware that the boy was Jewish; that he was a Feuchtwanger, related to Lion. What would have happened if he had known all this? “He would have done something. Without a doubt.” When I ask what he means by “done something”, he replies: “I’m sure we would have been killed in Dachau.”Feuchtwanger seems tired at this point in the conversation. While he dozes, his son shows me pictures from Feuchtwanger’s childhood, where he is with friends and wearing lederhosen. All over the house are piles of books and folders with documents from his childhood in Nazi Germany; family photos and awards hang on the walls. Next to Feuchtwanger is the German edition of his latest book, written with Cox, entitled Letters from a Child Exile (it will be published in the UK in spring 2026). The book compiles letters he wrote in 1939 to his parents from England while he waited for their arrival.After a few minutes Feuchtwanger tells me he’s ready to continue. In his memoir, I say, there is the following quote from his father: “Right in front of his eyes we are safer. His genius is so great that he forgets to look out of the window.” As his neighbours, they were hiding in plain sight. Feuchtwanger no longer remembers his father saying this, he says, “but it was certainly not the intention to emigrate. My father was very connected to German culture. That was his life.”As time went on, what Feuchtwanger saw from his room on the second floor changed. He had noticed how the counterdemonstrations had diminished, how people now stopped in front of the Führer’s apartment with their arms outstretched and shouted “Heil Hitler”, how the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain came to visit. Chamberlain was invited to Hitler’s private flat after they had signed the Munich agreement in the Führerbau, the building that symbolised the Nazis’ power, together with the Italian prime minister, Benito Mussolini, and France’s prime minister, Édouard Daladier.The Feuchtwangers’ lives were also changing. “We noticed that Hitler was a very clever man, the way he managed everything. It wasn’t good for us either,” says Feuchtwanger. While Hitler’s world was growing, his was shrinking.After the Nuremberg race laws were enacted in 1935, the Feuchtwangers lost their staff and Edgar his nanny, because Jews were no longer allowed to be employers. They were not allowed to enter shops. His father lost his job at the publishing house. Schoolmates turned against Edgar because they did not want to be friends with Jews.As a child, did he even realise the significance of being Jewish? “Jewishness didn’t play a big role in my life before the rise of National Socialism. It did in my father’s life, because my grandparents were Orthodox Jews. But by my time that had completely faded away. I didn’t know much about it,” he says. After Hitler came to power, the family became more conscious of it. “He turned it into something. And I didn’t really understand that. Back then, at primary school, I was like the other children at first. I went along with all the Nazi stuff. Have you seen my exercise books?”He leans forwards and reaches for a worn notebook. A few sheets almost fall out. There is a huge swastika on the first page. He drew it himself when he was about eight years old. “The teacher’s name was Miss Weikl, and she was very pro-Nazi right from the start, I think. She gave us tasks as children.” She dictated poems, had the children write birthday greetings to Hitler and make drawings of the “true” map of Germany, including the regions that the teacher said had been taken away from them. Did he ever question what he was drawing? “No. I did what the teacher wanted me to, and my parents said: ‘Do what the teacher says.’” What did his parents say about the drawings? “Nothing. They didn’t want trouble; they didn’t want me to fight back.”Sign up to Inside SaturdayThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

My father knew straight away that this was going to be very serious.” The German diplomat Ernst vom Rath had been killed in Paris on 7 November 1938 by a Jew. The assassination was part of the justification for what followed. Two days later came the November pogroms, sometimes known as Kristallnacht: synagogues were set on fire, Jewish shops were destroyed and looted, and Jews were imprisoned in concentration camps – among them Feuchtwanger’s father, Ludwig.“They came in the evening and took him to the concentration camp in Dachau, half an hour away from Munich. Later, they seized his books – I remember that well. My mother tried everything to get him out of the camp,” says Feuchtwanger. Was he aware of what concentration camps were back then? “Everyone knew that Dachau existed, that it could easily be deadly.” Deadly meaning that people were shot? “Yes. It was winter and they had to stand still for hours. If a person fell down, he was usually killed. The Nazis wanted people to know that, so that they wouldn’t resist them.”Six weeks passed, during which Feuchtwanger’s mother called numerous offices, travelled to the Dachau concentration camp herself and handed over some food for her husband at the gate, on which was written “Arbeit macht frei” as on many other concentration camps. Then, suddenly, Ludwig came home. Feuchtwanger doesn’t know why he was released. But he remembers that his father looked frighteningly thin, that he had to go to bed immediately. “He was seriously weakened.”As soon as his father was back on his feet, the family started making preparations for their departure. Many friends, including Bertolt Brecht and Thomas Mann, to whom Edgar had often delivered books on loan from Ludwig’s library, had long since left Germany. With money from Lion and other family members, they were able to obtain a family visa for England at a cost of £1,000, a vast sum back then.Two months passed before Feuchtwanger boarded the train in Munich. His father accompanied him as far as the Danish border, then travelled back to Munich, while Feuchtwanger got on a boat to England. He was 14 years old at the time. It was an adventure for him, he says. “The day I crossed the border was 19 February 1939 and it felt as if I had left an evil empire.”In England, he stayed with a family in Cornwall. He quickly learned the language and got a scholarship for college, but he worried about his parents. The letters that Feuchtwanger wrote during this time bear witness to this, such as this one dated 28 February 1939: “Dr and Mrs Dyson, I repeat, are particularly nice people. But the other people are very nice too … Come as soon as possible. Until then, all the best, 1,000 kisses. Your Bürschi.”He kept everything; his mother, Erna, did, too. When I ask him whether he would describe the Feuchtwangers as a family of collectors, he laughs. The past fills the house. A mirror and a painting from the Munich flat hang in the dining room. In the penthouse, as Feuchtwanger jokingly calls the room above the garage, is the grand piano from Munich that he and his mother used to play. His parents packed everything up when they fled, filled two 5-metre-long transport crates, and managed to get permission to have them shipped to England.Feuchtwanger’s parents arrived three months after him, and soon moved to Winchester. But his father never felt at ease in England. “He was a fish out of water. He couldn’t do anything here. He couldn’t speak the language. After the war, he wanted to go back to Germany. My mother didn’t really want to; she’d had enough of Germany.” His father’s plans never became reality: he died in 1947. Lion Feuchtwanger never returned to Germany, either. He lived first in exile in France, until the Nazi invasion forced him to flee. In 1941, he and his wife emigrated to the US, where he died in 1958.By contrast, Edgar quickly felt at home in England. He studied history, gained his doctorate at Cambridge and lectured at the University of Southampton. He and his wife, Primrose, bought a house in Winchester after their marriage in 1962, and it was there they brought up their three children, Antonia, Adrian and Judith. He now has three grandchildren. Primrose died in 2012. Since then, he has lived alone.In his work as a historian, Feuchtwanger focused initially on his new country – the Victorian era, Disraeli – and later on the country of his past – National Socialism and the Third Reich.Did he ever want to go back permanently? “I made connections with the University of Frankfurt and was a visiting professor. But I didn’t want to move back. It was too far away from my life. I mean, English is my everyday language. I can speak German perfectly well, but normally I speak in English.” Is he still a Bavarian? “I am a Bavarian at heart. And I’m, wait, it says here somewhere …” He fumbles for his magnifying glass and opens a copy of his autobiography, looking for a quote from a friend. “It says here: an honorary Englishman – that’s what I am.”The confirmation of this, the OBE awarded by the then Prince Charles at Windsor Castle in 2021, dangles from his suit. It was given for his contribution to Anglo-German relations. He also received the German Federal Cross of Merit in 2003.Looking back, he considers himself lucky. “I’m still here at over 100 years old, while most of them are gone. Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, they were all wiped out.” He laughs. As for his tips on reaching such an impressive age, he never smoked, he says.Is he a brave person, I ask. “A what?” I speak louder. He laughs and says immediately: “No, no, no!” His book tells the story of how in 1930 six-year-old Edgar and his half-sister, who was visiting from Switzerland, went to see whether the nameplate by the doorbell said Hitler. It didn’t. The name written there was Winter, the Führer’s housekeeper. Quite brave, I say. And travelling alone to England – that was also quite brave. “I had to go along with it. Even back then, when my father accompanied me on my escape to the border, the SS people came on the train and said to my father: ‘Why don’t you escape, too?’ And my father told them: ‘I’ll prepare everything.’ He left the train and I was just driven on. Of course, it was shocking. But there was nothing else I could do.”So, he is sticking with no? “Absolutely. I’m a person who goes along with everything. I take it as it comes. I don’t fight against what I can’t change. I know I don’t make the world turn; it turns without me.”He remains determined to speak as a contemporary witness about the rise of the Nazi era. “It was a good thing that I wrote my memoirs when I did. I couldn’t do it now.”More than a decade has passed since he published his book about being Hitler’s neighbour. That was a completely different political time, I say. Western democracies have experienced a shift to the right, and the rise of populism. In Germany, the far-right AfD became the second-largest party in the recent federal elections. “It’s very unpleasant that something like this is rising again in Germany,” Feuchtwanger says. “You look at it with fear.”",

            "content": "Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is now in charge of a number of councils across England, including 10 where it has overall control.Its haul of 677 council seats also means it is on the brink of power in at least four others where it emerged as the largest party. It also has two regional mayoralties – Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire – with budgets and powers.But the coming to power of the rightwing populist party also means, for the first time, that its promises to radically reshape Britain will be tested and felt by communities. Here are some of the areas where there could be change:Major solar and wind energy projects face threats from Reform-controlled councils whose members are instinctively hostile to net zero policies.“We will attack, we will hinder, we will delay, we will obstruct, we will put every hurdle in your way,” said the party’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, of such projects.A solar farm in Romney Marsh, Kent, which could power 20% of homes in the county, is in the crosshairs of party, which controls the council. In Staffordshire, a proposed windfarm in the county’s moorlands area and a solar farm in Cheadle will be opposed.But Reform’s plans will also meet hostility from within communities. In Greater Lincolnshire alone, net zero industries contribute about £980m to the local economy, accounting for 12,209 jobs, according to analysis by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU).Legally, the picture is also unclear. Reform could try to block pylons and large solar farms through the judicial review process, though the new planning and infrastructure bill aims to make the challenges harder.Farage’s unsubstantiated claims that doctors are “massively over-diagnosing” children with mental illness and special educational needs has sparked fears that Reform UK councils could further restrict or make dramatic cuts to special educational needs and disabilities provision (Send).The 10 councils where Reform have overall control are projected to have a combined deficit by March next year of £489m. It is as much as £95m in the case of Kent and £71m in Derbyshire.Reform councils could call for changes to the law to reduce access to education, health and care plans, which are much sought after by families of some children after years of state underinvestment in education.However, any moves to push for cuts or reshaping of policy also potentially risks sparking a backlash from both its own voters and splits within the party. Andrea Jenkyns, the mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, has spoken about her son having ADHD and appeared to contradict Farage. James McMurdock, a Reform MP in Essex, also cast himself as a champion of parents struggling to get Send support for children.Reform councils who unlawfully try to restrict access to Send support will face the prospect of being challenged at tribunals by families.In an echo of the axe taken by the Trump administration in the US, Farage has already warned: “If you are working in DEI or climate change then perhaps alternative employment is where you should be looking.”The party’s hostility to “gender ideology” could have repercussions for councils working with charities such as Positive Health, which runs sexual health promotion, education and HIV training for Lincolnshire.Any savings from cuts to supposed DEI-related schemes are likely to be minimal. Derbyshire and Lincolnshire have each pointed out they don’t have DEI schemes.Farage has said that Reform-controlled councils will “resist” accepting any more asylum seekers, pitting then on a potential collision course with Westminster.Zia Yusuf, the party’s chair, has also said its legal team is examining planning law mechanisms to challenge the use of hotels for asylum accommodation.The moves would have consequences in places such as Kent, where the county council has been at the forefront of handling provision for unaccompanied minors.But again the law would not be on the side of councils. The responsibility falls to the Home Office, which selects the hotels and contractors for the scheme.Reform has said only the St George and union flag will be flown at council property, although it backtracked when it came to the question of county flags.The policy appeared to be aimed at the flying of rainbow flags in solidarity with LGBT+ people and to celebrate Pride. It would also spell the end of councils flying Ukrainian flags, serving as a reminder that Farage has frequently been accused by Labour of “fawning” over Vladimir Putin.Other potential culture wars could arise over council funding of museums or galleries with exhibitions that are deemed to denigrate Britain’s history or the empire.Opposition to 15-minute cities – an urban planning concept that has become a lightning rod for conspiracy theorists – and support for “pro-motorist” policies have long been red meat to Reform.Farage lashed out in the local election campaign at “cycle lanes that no one uses” while Reform’s likely leader of Worcestershire county council, Alan Amos, claimed: “All the other parties have bent over backwards to please a small minority.”At the same time, Amos was eager to emphasise that Reform was eager to support bus travel, a hot issue in a number of counties where Reform’s voter base has tended to be older.When it comes to cycling, existing policies at many councils are already advanced while there is strong public support for cycling schemes.",

            "content": "Imagine a cheeseboard in a tart, but one you can have as a main course rather than having to wait for pudding: that’s the brief I set for myself when I was thinking about today’s recipe. First, I needed an excellent cheese, which is where the sweet, tangy dolcelatte comes in. Then something crisp and flaky to eat it with – the pastry. And then something nutty, jammy and herby to break up the richness, hence the caramelised shallots and pine nuts. Serve with a sharp, vinegary and fruity salad for the full monty.You’ll need a 23cm springform tin and baking beans (if you don’t have the latter, use rice or lentils instead). I like to serve this with a pear and mixed-leaf salad dressed with sharp cider vinegar and honey.Prep 10 min\n Cook 1 hr 10 min\n Serves 4-6320g ready-rolled shortcrust pastry\n  Extra-virgin olive oil\n  400g banana shallots, peeled, halved and thinly sliced6 garlic cloves, peeled and minced8 fresh thyme sprigs, leaves picked300g dolcelatte \n  150g full-fat cream cheese\n  100ml full-fat creme fraiche\n  Fine sea salt and black pepper\n  1½ tbsp pine nuts\n  14 sage leaves\n Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Lay the pastry in the 23cm tart tin and use your fingertips to press it into the base, making sure you push it right into the corners and up the sides. Cut off any excess pastry and use to fill any gaps. Trim around the top, then take a sheet of baking paper big enough to cover the pastry, scrunch it up, then unfurl and place in the centre. Fill with baking beans, then bake for 15 minutes. Lift out the paper and beans, bake again for 10 minutes, until golden, then take out of the oven and leave to cool.Meanwhile, put five tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then saute the shallots, garlic and thyme leaves for 15 minutes, until browning and starting to caramelise in places. Carefully drain the oil into a heatproof bowl, then stir in two tablespoons of the sauteed shallot mix.Transfer the rest of the shallots to a large bowl, stir in the cheeses, creme fraiche, a big pinch of ground black pepper and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk really well until smooth. Pour the cheese mix into the pastry shell, to fill. Evenly smooth out the top, then bake for 45 minutes, until nicely browned on top. Remove and leave to cool for 30 minutes.Just before serving, make the pine nut and sage topping. Put the reserved oil and shallots in a small frying pan and warm it over a medium heat. When it’s bubbling, stir in the pine nuts, sage leaves and a pinch of salt, and cook until the sage turns a deep emerald green. Pour the mix evenly over the top of the tart, then cut it into four or six even slices and transfer to plates. Serve with a sharp, leafy and fruity salad.",

            "content": "Up to 12 newly elected Reform UK councillors are facing allegations of sharing social media content ranging from support for the far right to explicitly Islamophobic comments.They include councillors at three different county councils who have shared social media content from Britain First, a far-right party known for staging provocative marches and stunts.A week after Reform’s local elections breakthrough, in which it won 677 of more than 1,600 seats contested, the backgrounds of its winning councillors are under scrutiny after the party largely sought to deflect allegations during the campaign.The councillors accused of retweeting Britain First content include Paul Harrison, who was elected to Leicestershire county council. He retweeted and said “yes” to a question posed on X by Britain First’s chair who asked if followers supported mass deportations and posted an AI-generated picture of Muslim men with Pakistani flags.Russell Cherry, elected as a councillor in Thurrock, allegedly retweeted Paul Golding, who is Britain First’s leader and has a conviction for religiously aggravated harassment. Ivan Dabbs, a Reform councillor in West Northamptonshire, also allegedly shared a Britain First tweet and material by Golding calling for a street demonstration.The off-the-shelf vetting software used by Reform UK before the elections was from Ferretly, a US social media startup founded in 2019, the Guardian has learned. The platform assesses digital red flags, including hate speech, disparaging or bullying behaviour and inflammatory rhetoric, along with connections to extremist groups or individuals.However, Reform has drawn criticism for its reliance on the platform after its leadership claimed to have the “most in-depth vetting procedure” of any party. In an interview with Times Radio on 30 April, Nigel Farage said vetting was done internally using “AI techniques and other things” to “give us a bit of a shortcut”.Neither the Conservatives nor Labour rely on AI software to the same degree. In the case of the Tories, a 30-strong group was involved in vetting each of its general election candidates.By Thursday, Reform was known to have lost at least three of its elected councillors. They included Donna Edmunds, a councillor in Shropshire who was suspended on Wednesday after she said that she planned to defect from the party.Edmunds, a supporter of Rupert Lowe who was kicked out of Reform and has been engaged in a bitter row with Farage, accused the Reform leader of treating members with contempt and described the party as a cult.Luke Shingler, who was elected in Warwickshire, said he would be an independent councillor for the “next 18 months” because his work meant he was unable to serve under a political organisation. Shingler is understood to work for the RAF. A third councillor, Desmond Clarke, has resigned from Nottinghamshire county council, triggering a byelection.Many of the alleged social media posts by Reform councillors were unearthed by the counter-extremism campaign group Hope Not Hate.Georgie Laming, Hope Not Hate’s director of campaigns, said: “Nigel Farage has claimed that Reform UK have the ‘most in-depth vetting procedure’ of any party. Our investigation shows that their processes leave much to be desired.“Not only have they admitted using ‘AI techniques and other things’ to do the vetting, but Reform UK continue to shirk responsibility for their candidates’ online behaviour. They have yet to drop any of the candidates that have been exposed,” she said.Hope Not Hate uncovered Reform candidates – some now elected – who posted anti-Muslim hate, pushed far-right conspiracies including calling the climate crisis a “globalist hysterical climate hoax”, praising extremists such as Tommy Robinson and sharing content from David Irving, the UK’s best known Holocaust denier.Reform has been approached for comment.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 06:00",
            "content": "It will take more than a TikTok trend to break Britons’ love affair with Mediterranean beaches. But latest figures show travellers are increasingly swapping Málaga for North Macedonia and Benidorm for the Balkans as part of a social media craze for “destination dupes”.Flights from the UK to Bosnia and Herzegovina soared by 284% in 2024 compared with the previous year, while trips to Montenegro increased by 164%. Getaways to Albania – billed by some as “the new Croatia” – rose by 61%, according to an analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.Experts say the appetite for lesser-known destinations is being driven by influencers promoting holiday “dupes” – locations that offer the same Insta-friendly scenery for a smaller budget.The travel blogger Tara Tadlock, who has nearly 15,000 followers on Instagram, said the trend was inspired by a post-Covid burst of adventure as well as the cost of living crisis, as holidaymakers hunt for bargains.“In the summer months accommodation prices spike … some restaurants will change their menus and charge extra,” she said. “The cost of living is a huge driver. I also think people are looking to get away from the crowds because there’s so many places now that are so congested with tourists.”The CAA data, analysed by Manchester Airports Group, also revealed that the number of flights to Azerbaijan had more than doubled between 2023 and 2024. Four African countries – Tunisia, Rwanda, Morocco and Ghana – also made the top 10 largest increases in flights from the UK over the same period.On TikTok, influencers with tens of thousands of followers promote trips to the slopes of Bansko, Bulgaria, instead of the costly French Alps, or a city break in the capital of Podgorica over crowded Athens and Budapest.The term “destination dupes” was coined by the travel firm Expedia in 2023. Experts spotted that influencers were sharing “duplicate destinations” in a similar way to imitations of designer clothing, another TikTok trend.It is not just gen Z travellers broadening their horizons, however. The CAA figures showed that millennials and their parents made up the bulk of the passengers heading to the Balkans. Under-25s comprised one in five of those arriving in Albania and 13% of those flying to Montenegro.The increased demand for lesser-known destinations is also explained by Covid-19, which experts believe changed how many people travel. While visits to tourist hotspots have bounced back – in part driven by an urge to tick off bucket list locations – other holidaymakers are avoiding the crowds.Research by Expedia found that 76% of boomers – born between 1946 and 1964 – prioritise quieter places compared with gen Z (40%). However, the younger generation tend to be much more inspired by online influencers (41% v 5%) in the search for adventures.Tadlock said she expected Albania to become “the new Croatia” as it has the stunning scenery without Croatia’s overtourism problem. “The experience I think is a little dampened when you have to wait in line for two hours,” she said. “I do also think that consumers are thinking more about sustainability and the effects of tourism or like just the impact of travel in general.”Andrew Macmillan, the chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which also operates London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said social media was increasingly driving the flights it offers.“We have undoubtedly seen the true power of social media when it comes to influencing where people choose to travel to,” he said.“Since 2019, the rise in popularity of platforms like TikTok has resulted in hidden gem destinations becoming not so hidden, which in turn has driven a surge in trips to these places.”Yet while some Britons were ready to roam, old habits die hard. Tenerife remained the most popular holiday destination from the UK in 2024, with 3 million passengers, followed by Málaga, Mallorca and Alicante. Bosnia and Herzegovina, in comparison, had 80,000 visits after an almost threefold increase, while Albania received just under a million passengers and Montenegro had more than 220,000.By Mary NovakovichIf British tourists are bypassing Benidorm in favour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they’re evidently in search of something well beyond the average beach holiday. For a start, Bosnia’s 12-mile sliver of the Adriatic coast at Neum – rather like that of Benidorm – is a concrete strip of sprawling resort hotels and crowded pebbly beaches. But you don’t come to Bosnia for the beaches – why would you when you have the jaw-dropping beauty of the Dinaric Alps, towering waterfalls, dramatic river canyons and some of Europe’s most captivating cities?Rather than join the crowds in Neum, head inland about 25 miles to the serene Hutovo Blato nature reserve, one of the most important wetlands in south-eastern Europe. Take a boat ride through the waterways and marshes of the reserve, keeping an eye out for the broad range of birdlife – herons, shrikes, cormorants, buntings, terns – before cooling off with a swim in Svitavsko Lake.From here, it’s about a 40-minute drive to one of the Herzegovina region’s greatest natural wonders, Kravica waterfalls, whose cascades thunder through rich greenery into the River Trebižat. Swim near the foot of the waterfall, or check out other river swimming spots including the clear waters of Božjak. If you haven’t brought a picnic, the waterside restaurants serving grilled meat and fish will keep you well fed at ridiculously affordable prices.This sets the stage for the sheer drama of Una national park, the largest in Bosnia, and most of which runs alongside the natural border formed by the River Una with Croatia. The Una has an almost magical hold on the hearts of people on both sides of the border, and over the course of 76 sq miles it dips and falls and crashes through thickly wooded slopes and fertile green plains. One of the park’s stars is Štrbački Buk, a towering waterfall where fearless tour guides on white-water rafting trips jump from the top and survive to tell the tale. There’s more to come further south at Martin Brod, the biggest collection of waterfalls in the park.Bosnia’s cities are just as compelling. Sarajevo, the capital, is endlessly fascinating, especially when you stand on pedestrianised Ferhadija street, with 19th-century Habsburg architecture to your left and the 16th-century Ottoman quarter to your right. Squeezed into this old Turkish Baščaršija quarter are cobbled lanes of coppersmiths, silversmiths, restaurants, courtyard gardens, an old caravanserai and Bosnia’s largest mosque, Gazi Husrev-beg. As the city marks 30 years since the end of the 1992-95 war, it’s an apt time to visit the Museum of Crimes Against Humanity and Genocide and the Siege of Sarajevo Museum.Herzegovina’s chief city, Mostar, is a popular – often too popular – destination for day-trippers from Dubrovnik. But it’s hard to resist the magnificence of its reconstructed 16th-century Ottoman bridge, Stari Most, the emblem of the city. Once the crowds are gone, you can amble through the old Ottoman quarter at a more relaxed pace. From here it’s less than a half-hour drive to the extraordinary sight of the 16th-century Sufi lodge Blagaj Tekke, which was ingeniously built into a limestone gorge by the source of the River Buna. You won’t find that in Benidorm.",

            "content": "It wasn’t something I saw coming. A film about the situation in the West Bank – an evergreen story if ever there was one – going viral. Appreciation, dismay, gratitude, outrage at what the film showed … Through the week it kept going. More retweets, more feedback, a little bit of pushback. Shock was the theme of many messages – the idea that this was going on. And a feeling of: “At last.” “At last, mainstream British TV is saying something about what is happening.”The film was a follow-up of sorts. In 2010, I’d made a documentary called Ultra Zionists. It was a look at the Israeli religious nationalist community that exists in the West Bank – the area across the eastern edge of Israel that has been under military occupation since the six-day war of 1967. Now, a decade and a half on, with the world’s attention on Gaza, it was being reported that the settlers were ramping up their activities. The Israeli government had given them thousands of assault rifles. Shootings of Palestinians, vandalism of their property and harassment were all on the rise.We envisioned the film as a kind of road movie through a region under military occupation. On two trips of a little over a week each, with my director Josh Baker and producers Sara Obeidat and Matan Cohen, I drove up and down the West Bank. I made inroads in the settler community, interviewing exponents of the settler mindset. People such as Ari Abramowitz of Arugot Farm, a resort for tourists that sits deep inside the occupied West Bank. Abramowitz was born and raised in Texas but came to Israel as a young man, qualifying for Israeli citizenship due to his Jewish heritage. For our interview, he met me wearing an assault rifle and a handgun. He took me on a tour of the land and declared his view that the Palestinian people “don’t exist”.I also spent time with Daniella Weiss, the woman often touted as the “godmother” of the settler project. An energetic 79-year-old, Weiss has been working to expand Israeli presence in the West Bank – or Judea and Samaria, as she calls it – for more than 50 years, lobbying governments, raising funds domestically and internationally, promoting a vision of an entirely Israeli-ruled region, with the Palestinians pushed to either accept it or leave.Weiss hosted me at her suburban-style home in the settlement of Kedumim, amid books and family photos. Showing me a map on her wall, she explained that Lebanon, Jordan and parts of Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq were all part of Greater Israel. She explained the settlement process, of creating ever more outposts of religious Israelis. Under international law, the moving of a civilian population into occupied territory is a war crime, I said. This amused her. I mentioned that elements of the Israeli security apparatus viewed her activities with dismay and criticised the extreme settlers for engaging in what they called “Jewish terror”. She shrugged this all off.We saw her in action at an event promoting the idea of Jewish-only settlements in Gaza – the latest frontier in settler activity. In a fiery speech, she announced that the Palestinians of the region needed to leave and go to other countries – to Turkey, to Canada – anywhere else. On another visit to the Gaza border, she brought a prominent rabbi, Dov Lior. With the smoking ruins behind him, he spoke of the need to “cleanse” the land of “camel riders”. In the encounter that made the film’s closing scene, Weiss and I had a heated exchange of views on a hilltop at Evyatar, the latest settlement to be recognised by the Israeli state.Over the days of the shoot, driving around through checkpoints, past blast walls and guard towers and olive groves and Palestinian towns, I thought back to my previous visit 14 years before. Much was still the same. The same sense of a two-tier society: Jewish settlers who lived protected under Israeli civil law; Palestinians who were subject to an opaque regime of military rule, with roads closed, life made difficult in ways big and small. The daily indignity of queues and passport checks. The fear of settler vandalism and intimidation.The reaction to the film, when it aired, was immediate. Positive write-ups and massive online commentary. Some reviews thought they detected a new “seriousness” in my approach. They referenced a moment when I told Daniella Weiss her views seemed “sociopathic” – after she suggested she was only interested in the welfare of her own people and didn’t give any thought to other people’s. It was said I seemed more assertive than usual. I’m not sure whether that’s true. But I do think the gravity of what is unfolding gave the encounter more impact.A few pieces were critical of the film. The main charge was that I’d focused on a handful of crazies who weren’t representative of the wider community. “Weiss is a crackpot,” wrote a reviewer in the Daily Mail. On X, the Conservative environmentalist Ben Goldsmith claimed that the extremists in the film “represent a nutty fringe in Israeli society … about as … accurate a representation of the whole as Tommy Robinson is of UK society”.But this comparison reveals what makes the situation in the West Bank so peculiar. In the UK, Robinson is widely seen as a fringe actor. He is excluded from politics and shunned by those close to government. And yet here was a situation where a similar figure enjoys enormous clout within the Israeli cabinet and who has the protection of the army in her project of settler expansionism. As the Haaretz journalist Etan Nechin said, responding to Goldsmith, “their representatives are literally sitting in the government and control everything from the police to treasury”.Others asked why I didn’t mention that hundreds of thousands of the Palestinians who live under occupation in the West Bank are already refugees – or the descendants of them – having been pushed off land they lived on in 1948 when the state of Israel was created. Now they face potentially a second displacement, with settlers – and elements of the Israeli state – pushing for further deportations and continuing to make life intolerable for Palestinians.The part of the analysis that was less explicitly stated but present in the background was the idea of “why pick on Israel?” – the idea that atrocities of comparable seriousness are taking place in other parts of the world and that by reporting on religious nationalist Israeli extremism we may have contributed to anti-Jewish sentiment. I take this charge seriously, for reasons I hope are obvious.But the urgency here is that West Bank settlers are a bellwether for where society may be going in countries across the west. In the past, the settler agenda has been supported by governments on both the left and the right but it’s currently being embraced by populist leaders and elements of the far right who find much to like about its ethno-nationalist and anti-democratic character. Around the same time that the documentary aired, Israel’s national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is a settler, was being hosted at Mar-a-Lago. And so a film about extreme West Bank settlers isn’t simply about a region of the Middle East. It’s also about “us”.While the global response to The Settlers has been encouraging in the main, there is also an aspect to it that is deflating. As Peter Oborne pointed out, quite rightly, in a sympathetic review, “this film tells us nothing new about the situation in the occupied West Bank”. The facts were well known to those paying attention – from the Oscar-winning No Other Land, to ITV’s Our Land: Israel’s Other War, a documentary that includes extraordinary scenes of settlers seizing control of farmland and making veiled references to intimidation and displacement.One of the sadder and more outrageous results of our film involved the Palestinian activist Issa Amro. Amro lives in Hebron, a West Bank city that, since 1968, has had 700 or so settlers living at its very heart, in a cordon of Israeli military occupation. We filmed Amro on a walk through this so-called “sterile zone” – the term the army uses. Just a few days after the film aired, Issa reported on his social media that he had been harassed by settlers and soldiers at his home, in what appeared to be a reprisal for his participation in our documentary. Our team got in touch with him and did its best to provide appropriate support.The scholar and writer Hamza Yusuf said on X that the outrage over everything depicted in The Settlers “says a lot about how well the media has shielded the public from the brutal reality of Israel’s occupation”. As proud as I am of the film, I know that our documentary could never capture the full impact of what is unfolding in the West Bank. The reality of the displacement and harassment is often in interactions that are more extreme than those I saw.So I am grateful for the reaction. I encourage people to read and consume more on the subject. I’m glad we were able to show as much as we did. I also wish we could have shown much more.As told to Jason Okundaye.

            "content": "Slovenia’s populist opposition has mounted a campaign against “degenerate” artists as it seeks to topple government plans for special pension top-ups for award-winning artists in a referendum on Sunday.Voters in the central European country will cast their verdict on a government bill that details the conditions and terms under which certain artists can claim an allowance to be added to their pensions.For the referendum law to be rejected, at least one-fifth of all eligible voters among Slovenia’s population of 2.12 million must vote “no”. The number of “no” votes must also represent more than half of all votes cast.The bill, which passed parliament in January, has been prepared by the culture ministry that is held by the leader of the eco-socialist Left party, Asta Vrečko. The government – comprised of a coalition of the Freedom Movement, Social Democrats and Left parties – says it is enacting an overdue reform of special pension provisions for persons of merit that dates back to 1974, when Slovenia was one of the republics of Yugoslavia, by tying them to stricter criteria rather than leaving them at the mercy of the personal tastes of whichever politician holds the culture ministry.Leading in the polls a year before national elections, however, the conservative Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) has found in the relatively technical tweak to a 50-year-old law a rich seam for a culture war against perceived cultural elites. The referendum was initiated by the party, which is led by Janez Janša, a former prime minister.Janša, an admirer of Donald Trump who has led the SDS since 1993, said in March that classical art was “being replaced by all sorts of degenerate, unhinged models that claim to be ‘modern’” – his choice of the adjective izrojen echoing the term used by the German Nazi party to denounce modern art, entartete or “degenerate”.Posters and billboards hung across Slovenian towns across the country since February have featured an image of the Slovenian artist Maja Smrekar breastfeeding a dog, alongside the slogan: “Change for the people, prestige for the elite.”Smrekar, 47, said the image is being used without her permission and wrenches out of context a single picture from a larger project, called K-9 Topology, which explores the bonds between humans and canines.“Ever since the four weeks of signature collection for the referendum, I have received numerous threats and highly offensive messages via various communication channels,” she told the Guardian. “When politics decides what is art and what isn’t, that’s when democracy breaks down.”Over the course of a four-month residency at Berlin’s Freies Museum in 2015-2016, the Brežice-born artist underwent psycho-endocrinological training to induce lactation and breastfed a sheepdog puppy, as “a form of interspecies solidarity and care”.In 2017, Smrekar’s K-9 Topology won the Golden Nica trophy at Austria’s Prix Ars Electronica, one of the world’s oldest media art competitions, followed by Slovenia’s prestigious Prešeren Foundation award in 2018.Under the new criteria proposed by the government, the combination of these awards would entitle Smrekar to a pension top-up equalling 50% of the difference between her existing pension and the highest one calculated from the pension base for 40 years of service.Sign up to This is EuropeThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentafter newsletter promotionJanša’s SDS, which has governed Slovenia for almost nine of the last 20 years and handed out seven “special pensions” for cultural merit in 2022, says the proposed new rules would lead to an increasing share of public funds being allocated to “privileged” individuals, including those “who have contributed very little, if anything, to the pension fund”. An SDS spokesperson said: “Meanwhile, more than half of all pensioners live below the poverty line.”The divisive referendum campaign is taking place against the backdrop of a broader pension reform embarked on by the government of Robert Golob, the prime minister, at the urging of the European Commission, which will lead to a rise in the retirement age from 60 years to 62 for those who have worked 40 years.The government says that while its bill would initially lead to a surge of special pensions for artists on a waiting list, the overall burden on taxpayers would eventually stabilise at a lower cost than under the old law.Of the 83 artists receiving special pensions for artists in Slovenia, 33 are next-of-kin who inherited it from the original recipient under the rules of original 1974 law. The revised bill would scrap the inheritance rule.Slovenia’s national electoral commission has calculated the cost of the referendum on the bill could amount to about €6.6m. “The referendum is being abused as an election campaign, and a very costly one at that”, Vrečko, the culture minister, told the Guardian.Golob – who was a newcomer at the 2022 elections – has urged the voters to boycott the vote, earning stark rebukes from the opposition. At Slovenian elections in 2022, his Freedom Movement emerged as a surprise winner, bucking an electoral trend towards rightwing populist rule in central and eastern European states such as Hungary and Serbia.",

            "content": "Even midweek, warm spring weather brings crowds to the top of Padley Gorge. Sheffielders bask on patches of grass beside the peaty trickle of Burbage Brook. The ice‑cream van on the road above does brisk trade. Kids shriek as they splash in the water. The lack of rain has brought out fire notices: “No barbecues”; and, in a sign of the times, “No shisha”. There’s a faint smell of weed, but that’s about it on the combustibles.The world below is wholly different. Here the stream bed drops away and its banks become thronged with oaks. These are not the straight-stemmed specimens of manicured parkland. They are demotic, stunted, twisted, writhing wonders that jostle and clash, a labyrinth of shade and mystery. Paths run either side of the stream, and from my perch I can look down on small groups of people moving through this otherworld, occasionally looking up from the rocky path to gaze at the canopy.Where I’m sitting is an old spoil tip of gritstone from a long-abandoned quarry, now smothered in parched moss and shaded by trees. Its position has brought me level with the branches of a nearby oak, its new leaves lime-green in the soft light. I notice one branch is occupied. Standing tall is a spotted flycatcher, lately arrived from Africa. All around, the air hums with insects of contrasting size and habits, hoverflies sliding on invisible rails, a small white butterfly flopping around the oak’s trunk. Yet the flycatcher remains entirely still.For an allegedly drab bird, this small passerine has lots of rizz. Its colours are muted, creams and browns, but their combination is subtly elegant. It holds itself upright and poised. And this stillness compels me. I watch for movement and there is none, just a watchfulness as the world pours into the black globe of its eye. Then, an explosive blur of wings, a body arcing in space, and it’s back on the branch, a thorax and legs clamped in its beak, eye still open to the infinite.

            "title": "Where does Pope Leo XIV stand on key issues like sexual abuse, climate and poverty?",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/where-does-pope-leo-xiv-stand-on-key-issues-like-sexual-abuse-climate-and-poverty",
            "content": "What is the position of Pope Leo XIV on the issues that face him and the Roman Catholic church?Within hours of his election as the 267th pontiff, Leo was being talked about as a bridge builder, a pope that would continue in Francis’s footsteps but without alienating traditionalists in the way his predecessor sometimes did. He is “known for solid judgment and a keen capacity to listen, and someone who doesn’t need to pound his chest to be heard”, according to a recent profile on Crux, a Catholic news website. He is “more pragmatic, cautious and discreet than the late pope”, it added.In his first appearance on the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica, he wore traditional papal attire, signalling that his style will be more formal than Francis’s, who opted for a simple white cassock for his first balcony appearance.Although he is expected to follow Francis in many respects, he is likely to do so in a more emollient manner than his predecessor. In his opening remarks as pontiff, Leo said: “We have to be a church that works together to build bridges and to keep our arms open.” He will try to be a symbol of greater unity in the church.Nevertheless some conservative cardinals and bishops in the US may bridle at his earlier criticisms of Donald Trump and his inclination towards a progressive, inclusive position. One of Trump’s most prominent Catholic allies, Steve Bannon, called Leo the “worst pick for Maga Catholics”, deeming him the “anti-Trump pope”.In his years working in Peru, Leo – then Robert Prevost – acquired a reputation as a moderating influence among the country’s ideologically disparate bishops. He will need to draw on that to hold together the different factions of the global church.Leo’s theology is focused on the poor and marginalised, following his predecessor’s priorities. He has been critical on social media of harsh immigration policies. As pontiff, his language is expected to be less confrontational than Francis’s, but he is likely to endorse the same priorities rather than seek to roll back the late pope’s legacy.One indication is his view on the role of bishops, expressed while serving as head of the Vatican’s ultra-powerful Dicastery for Bishops for the past two years. A bishop is “not supposed to be a little prince sitting in his kingdom but rather called authentically to be humble, to be close to the people he serves, to walk with them and suffer with them”, he told Vatican News last year.Leo has spoken out on the need for urgent action on the climate crisis, aligning with Francis’s environmental priorities. He has stressed the church must move “from words to action” and warned against the “harmful” consequences of unchecked technological development. “Dominion over nature” should not become “tyrannical”, he said last year. It must be a “relationship of reciprocity”.Leo is expected to want the Vatican’s diplomats to be involved in efforts to end conflicts, principally in Ukraine, Gaza and South Sudan. His first words as pontiff to the world were “peace be with you all” and he called for “a disarmed peace and a disarming peace”.Prevost was accused of “disregarding allegations” of abuse against two priests in Peru, and has “a history of resisting disclosure of abuse information to the public”, according to the survivors’ organisation BishopAccountability.Over the past two years, when he headed the Dicastery for Bishops, he oversaw cases of bishops accused of abuse and its cover-up, said Anne Barrett Doyle, a co-director of BishopAccountability. “He maintained the secrecy of that process, releasing no names and no data. Under his watch, no complicit bishop was stripped of his title.”As Pope Leo, he must “win the trust of victims and their families”, she added.According to the College of Cardinals report on him, Leo’s supporters “stress his innocence and say the cases have been inaccurately and unfairly reported in the media”. They insist he followed proper procedures in the case of two Peruvian priests accused of molesting girls.The issue of sexual abuse and its cover-up is likely to dog Leo’s papacy as it did Francis’s. Although Francis came to a better understanding of the scale of the crisis in the church, survivors say he did not take enough concrete action and they will be watching Leo closely.In recent years, Prevost has largely kept a low profile on the issues of sexuality and identity. In 2012, he expressed concern that western news media and popular culture promoted “sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel”, specifically referencing the “homosexual lifestyle” and “alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children”.Last year, he neither endorsed nor rejected blessings for same-sex couples, saying there were cultural differences across the globe, with some countries still criminalising same-sex relationships.LGBT+ Catholics Westminster, a UK-based campaign group, said: “Opinions and ideas can change … He has expressed openness to marginalised groups, though his stance on specific issues remains ambiguous, including the concerns of LGBT+ Catholics.”In October 2023, Prevost said that “clericalising women” – ordaining them – would not solve the church’s problems and might even create new ones. “The apostolic tradition is something that has been spelled out very clearly, especially if you want to talk about the question of women’s ordination to the priesthood,” he said.But, he added: “I think there will be a continuing recognition of the fact that women can add a great deal to the life of the church on many different levels.”In 2022, he appointed three women to aid him in his job advising on the selection of bishops.",

            "content": "To be honest, mothers make me sad. Especially working mothers with small children. Sometimes, when I see a woman in the late afternoon – pushing a buggy, a sniffling toddler in tow, tote bags swinging from her shoulder and two dark circles around her eyes – I want to cross the street. Not out of judgment, but because I can’t bear how exhausted she looks. The quiet despair etched into her face. I feel sorry for her. It’s so damn unfair. Studies and statistics back this up: the status quo for working mothers is dismal.For years, I’ve witnessed it up close, too – in friends, work colleagues, relatives and neighbours. Their inner conflict. The overload. The heartbreak of falling short of whatever illusions they had. The anger at their limits, their circumstances. Because it really is insanely hard to work and, at the same time, keep up an orderly life, with a stocked fridge, a shiny sink, a happy child. And ideally still be a sexually attractive partner, an active citizen, a present friend. Caring for everyone – and yourself. It’s a life lived at the edge of collapse.At the same time, I sometimes find myself becoming annoyed by the complaints from mothers – in media debates, on social media, in books, podcasts, blogs and newsletters.This public display of their fate and self-sacrifice. Come on, I think. No one has to have a child in the 21st century. Women have choices now. Don’t they?But then I quickly pause. Is it really a choice if you abandon the idea of motherhood because you’ve seen how brutal the reality can be? Because you’ve internalised that having a child has meant, for generations of women, being torn in impossible directions?No probably not, and maybe women like me, East German women who love to work and were raised with a firm hand, have an especially tough time coming to terms with motherhood. We don’t have a tradition of the housewife. Housewives were viewed with suspicion, looked down on with a kind of contempt – like pitiful characters from a Grimm’s fairytale. Work wasn’t just encouraged – it was expected. It’s in our bones. You’re not a wimp was the message we got: you’re resilient.I still remember very clearly how teachers and mothers drilled it into me and my girlfriends as teenagers: marry, have a baby, but never depend on a man. Find a career that fulfils you but also brings financial independence and security. The goal was to become a wonderfully emancipated woman who managed it all on her own – including motherhood. Because that, too, was part of being a proper, productive citizen.I know that might sound OK in theory. Maybe even progressive. Did socialism help women emancipate themselves?If you only looked at the numbers, you might say yes. In 1989, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall, 91% of all working-age women in the GDR were either employed or in training or higher education. In West Germany, only 51% of women worked, and most of them were part-time. The divorce rate in the GDR was about 1.5 times higher than in West Germany. Being a single mother wasn’t scandalous – it was common. People changed partners more easily. You could survive on your own because the system supported you, with daycare, nurseries and after-school programmes that were all practically free.These effects still linger. There are more childcare options in eastern Germany and a smaller gender pay gap. And emotionally? Maybe East German women never clung as tightly to the romantic notion of love for life. It’s empowering, yes. But also lonely.To me, this way of thinking also meant: don’t rely on someone else and certainly don’t expect much – maybe nothing at all – from men, fathers, partners. For my generation, who grew up during the post-German reunification era, fathers were notable mainly by their absence. They went to work, came home for dinner, grumbled and spent weekends washing the car or mowing the lawn. That’s how it was for us – and for many, it still is.That’s also why I don’t have children. I don’t want to be a mother. Sure, there are days – usually just before ovulation – when my body and hormones go into overdrive, filling my head with baby thoughts and the relentless ticking of the biological clock. I struggle. I berate myself, thinking I’m a selfish bitch refusing to do her duty. Stop being so dramatic. Come on. Don’t be stupid – you’ll regret it later. But somehow the internal struggle has never been enough to change my mind.I recently asked a friend how she knew she wanted a child. “You just feel it,” she said. That phrase. It’s the same one people use when talking about finding a partner or a new apartment. But here’s the difference: you can move out of an apartment. You can leave a relationship if it doesn’t feel right – and let’s be honest, most of them (that’s also a statistical fact) don’t last for ever. But a child is forever. Motherhood is forever, whether you want it to or not. And that, to me, is the terrifying part: it takes away the ability to choose.I learned that lesson early. After all, I was a child myself. I’ve seen that motherhood is a battlefield – not just a battle with the demands of the child, but an even fiercer clash within the mother: between the woman who wants to love and nurture, and the woman who longs for autonomy. I don’t trust myself to reconcile that struggle. I’ve seen it first-hand. And I don’t buy the myth that you can be both. Sure, life goes on – but it doesn’t move forward in the way we imagine.Technically, when my grandmother was pregnant with my mother, she was already carrying me as well – the cells, the egg that would become me. Which means I wasn’t just inside my mother’s weary body, but inside my grandmother’s, too – a body worn out by the same unspoken overload and sadness.I remember my grandmother’s endless self-questioning: why had motherhood been so hard? She had wanted children, hadn’t she? So why had every day felt like an exhausting test, filled with the kind of repetition that stripped life of its meaning? Open the door. Close it. Up the stairs. Down. Cook, clean, go to work, come home, do the laundry. Tidy up, take care of the children. Smile when your husband returns. Don’t let the sadness show. Keep going. Always keep going. Her own needs? Forgotten. Where was her appetite for life? When was the last time anything brought her joy?I don’t trust myself to be different. After all, I’m her grandchild. I can’t give in to the naive belief that I could somehow fix the mistakes of the past. The mother of my mother, the mother of my mother’s mother, and so on. If only we could trace the roots of it all, to see how the spell was cast in the first place.And even if I were bold enough to consider motherhood for myself, I definitely don’t trust the men of my generation. I don’t want to become a weary, overwhelmed mother – nor do I want to be a “supermom”, pushing myself to the brink of exhaustion just to prove that it’s somehow possible. Working couples with kids are still far from any kind of equal or fair division of labour. You can change laws and tweak parental leave policies, but the family model, regardless of east or west, stubbornly remains one that demands everything from women and excuses men for no reason.It’s absurd, isn’t it? When I see a man with a pram, I don’t want to cross the street – instead, my first thought is: “How cute, he’s really involved.” But since when and for how long? That reaction shows just how deeply our double standards are ingrained.I keep focusing on mothers and grandmothers to find answers, but where are the men? The fathers, the grandfathers? Their side of the battlefield remains eerily silent and empty. They seem to be held accountable for nothing. We’ve given them a free pass.The expectations placed on women are sky-high. The expectations of men, when it comes to fatherhood? I’m not even sure what they are – or if they ever truly existed. What I do know is that it’s taken me years to see the spell for what it is. A bunch of flowers on Mother’s Day, which Germany and many other European countries mark on Sunday, surely won’t change anything. The greater gesture lies in stepping away from the inherited narratives that confine us. Let the clock tick.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

It was a real safe spot,” he said.Emergency services personnel, local sports club representatives, town leaders and friends attended the vigil, which included a smoking ceremony and shared meals.Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotion“Everyone, from little kids and classmates to people that didn’t know them, have been really affected,” Cr Brady said.“They felt they needed to be there, (they) were struggling.”The weather was calm and the mood peaceful as balloons were released as the sun set.“It was a (moment) for deep reflection watching them float away. Everyone just focused on that sunset,” Cr Brady said.“It was very important in our grief process to be able to honour their lives.”A tree was planted for each boy, and there was a ceremonial presentation of their yellow belts – which the young karate students were due to receive this weekThe karate class also performed a traditional routine.

            "content": "Daria Kasatkina’s switch from Russian tennis to play for Australia has been given a stamp of approval from her Ukrainian conqueror at the Italian Open.Marta Kostyuk, one of the women’s tour’s in-form players, has made a high-profile point along with many of her fellow Ukrainian players of not shaking hands with Russian or Belarusian opponents after matches in protest at the invasion of her homeland.But after defeating her for the first time since the world No 15 switched allegiance to Australia in March, Kostyuk was quick to offer her hand at the net on Friday after her 6-4, 6-2 win before praising Kasatkina for what she believed was a courageous stand she had taken against Russia. Kasatkina took permanent Australian residency a month ago, having criticised Russia’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws as well as the war against Ukraine.“It’s always nice to shake hands with someone I respect,” said Kostyuk after the match, adding that she hoped Kasatkina would continue to speak out against the war now she had the “freedom” to do so. “When someone not only tells the truth – calling Russia the aggressor – but also acts on it, that deserves respect,” the 22-year-old had also noted in an Instagram post before the match.“Daria Kasatkina has clearly spoken out against the war and made the decision to give up her Russian sports citizenship. This takes courage – and I acknowledge it. I hope this is not the final step but part of a deeper commitment. I stand with Ukraine. I stand for truth, for dignity, and for those who choose to speak and act – when staying quiet would be easier.”Kasatkina has said how much she has appreciated the support she’s had from everyone since her switch, but now playing in her third tournament as an Australian, she hasn’t had much joy on the court, with her record in the green-and-gold now reading two wins and three defeats.Sign up to Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskafter newsletter promotionElsewhere around the Foro Italico courts on Friday, world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, fresh from her Madrid Open triumph over Coco Gauff, opened with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Anastasia Potapova, while Gauff herself had to work hard for a 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 win over Canadian qualifier Victoria Mboko.",

            "content": "Writing history and telling stories aren’t analogous acts, even if their disciplines overlap and interact. When the world of academia – with its seeming rigour and professionalism, boosted by citations and peer reviews – confronts a culture with thousands of years of oral tradition but no written word, the tension between the two feels dangerously apposite. This could be the stuff of terrific drama, if only playwright and director Andrea James could wrestle her material into something more coherently dramatic.The conceit of The Black Woman of Gippsland is sturdy and instantly intriguing: Jacinta (Chenoa Deemal) is writing her PhD on the “white woman of Gippsland”, an urban legend about a woman shipwrecked off the coast of Corner Inlet in 1840, who was supposedly taken in by members of the Gunaikurnai mob.Two expeditions sent from Melbourne to “rescue” her led not to her return (she may never have existed) but to the savage butchering of the Gunaikurnai people. Jacinta’s exploration of this myth and its aftermath – her meticulous picking at the threads of story to uncover a wider truth – ruffles some feathers in her family, notably her Aunty Rochelle (Ursula Yovich) and cousin Kyle (Zach Blampied).The myth of the lost white person in the wilderness (often a woman or child) is ubiquitous in Australian colonial history, underpinned by an Anglocentric disquiet about the bush and its original inhabitants. Jacinta knows too well the vein of racism running through the apocryphal story of the white woman of Gippsland; it would spoil the plot to say more, but she lives with the consequences of an unjust legal system every day. And while a grappling with methodology – the university’s rejected oral sources key to her theory – hinders her academic ambitions, real damage is happening to her family in the present.All of which should make The Black Woman of Gippsland a crackling, provocative work of decolonisation and resistance. But while the play feels suitably weighted by its ideas, James never finds a way to make compelling drama out of it. Much of the characterisation is flat and simplistic – the gruff cop and the supercilious PhD supervisor – and the actors are often left with little to do. Black deaths in custody and the tragedy of the stolen generation, while nominally relevant, seem shoehorned into an otherwise thin plot, and the tone is often didactic.Some good performances anchor the play: Deemal is terrific as the dogged but circumspect Jacinta, determined to uncover truths she already senses in her body. There is a weariness threaded through her tenacity that speaks powerfully of generational trauma and the burden of ambition. Yovich is strong too as Aunty Rochelle, her head often slowly shaking from side to side with grim purpose. She manages to suggest a ring of protection, harbouring her immediate family. And Blampied has a likable, jocular presence, but he’s hampered by an underwritten part.For a play haunted by generational loss and grief, Romanie Harper’s set remains frustratingly prosaic. Three richly detailed playing spaces sit unmoored in front of a blue curtain, while Rhian Hinkley’s video projections swirl ineffectually above. There is a stunning coup embedded in the design but it emerges far too late; the play needs access to the sacred throughout, to ground and centre the superb ceremonial dances choreographed by Brent Watkins. As it stands, they feel awkwardly superimposed.At one point in The Black Woman of Gippsland, Jacinta protests, “I’m not a nerd, I’m a blackademic.” It’s a flippant line that nevertheless gives us a glimpse of a whole world – of a wave of new academics keen to dismantle a system that denigrates black oral history, even over blatant white lies. James’s play is ultimately about a massive clash of values, a battle between opposing worldviews. But she doesn’t manage to fold that battle into the drama in a meaningful way; characters have to tell us things that should rightfully emerge from their actions. That gap between languages, that murky, unresolved space we all occupy in a brutally colonised country, refuses to close.The Black Woman of Gippsland is on at the MTC, Sumner Theatre, until 31 May.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 02:57",
            "content": "The Trump administration is considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus, the legal right to challenge one’s detention, Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, said on Friday.“The constitution is clear, and that of course is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus could be suspended in time of invasion. So that’s an option we’re actively looking at. A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,” Miller said to a group of reporters at the White House.The suspension clause of the US constitution says: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” The writ of habeas corpus has only been suspended four times in US history, most notably by Abraham Lincoln during the civil war. It was also suspended during efforts to fight the Ku Klux Klan in the 19th century in South Carolina, in the Philippines in 1905 and in Hawaii after Pearl Harbor.Suspending habeas corpus would be an extremely aggressive move that would dramatically escalate the Trump administration’s efforts to attack the rule of law in American courts as it tries to deport people without giving them a chance to challenge the basis of their removals.Miller, long known for his far-right positions on immigration, has sought to deploy a maximalist approach in carrying out mass deportations. The US government has already produced little evidence to justify immigrant deportations and in some cases has sought to remove students in the United States legally for expressing their views, specifically support for Palestinians.Many of the immigrants that the Trump administration has moved aggressively to deport – including Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk – have filed habeas petitions challenging efforts to deport them.The administration has already attempted to deport people without due process by invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), an 18th-century law that allows the president to do so in a time of war.The Trump administration has justified its use of wartime authorities granted by the law by arguing that the US is under “invasion” by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. However, federal judges appointed by six different presidents, including Trump, have rejected the administration’s claim that the United States is under invasion and blocked the removals.As Judge Karen Henderson, a Reagan and George W Bush appointee, wrote on 26 March, in concurrence with Judge Patricia Millett, an Obama appointee, “the government claims that the term ‘invasion’ as used in the AEA encompasses ‘the arrival somewhere of people or things who are not wanted there’. The text and its original meaning say otherwise. The theme that rings true is that an invasion is a military affair, not one of migration.”Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee, echoed that rejection of the government’s claim to be facing an invasion, writing on 23 April that the administration’s lawyers “have provided no evidence, or even any specific allegations”, as to how anyone who entered the country as an unaccompanied minor and later sought asylum “poses a threat to public safety”.As Steve Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor, wrote in his newsletter on Friday: “Miller is being slippery about the actual text of the constitution.” The suspension clause “does not say habeas can be suspended during any invasion”, Vladeck noted, and it actually says that the right “shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it”.“[T]he whole point is that the default is for judicial review except when there is a specific national security emergency in which judicial review could itself exacerbate the emergency,” Vladeck argued. “The emergency itself isn’t enough. Releasing someone like Rümeysa Öztürk from immigration detention poses no threat to public safety.”But while courts have tried to stop the administration’s efforts to unlawfully deport people, Trump has attacked judges for ruling against him and in some cases openly defied the courts.",

Trump, who departs on Monday on a trip to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, was asked what his message to Putin is in the wake of a warning from the US embassy in Kyiv about a “potentially significant” air attack in the coming days. “I have a message for both parties: Get this war ended,” Trump said of Ukraine and Russia. “Get this stupid war finished.”Ukrainian troops have made further attempts to breach the Russian border in the Kursk and Belgorod regions, the Russian defence ministry said on Friday as President Putin hosted world leaders at a major military parade in Moscow. The defence ministry said the attacks occurred during a three-day ceasefire running from 8-10 May that Russia has unilaterally declared to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war.Ukraine has called the ceasefire a “farce” and on Friday documented scores of armed clashes.The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland are due in Kyiv on Saturday for a symbolic visit to Ukraine. The visit comes as the US warned of intelligence about a big impending air attack on Ukraine..Despite warnings from European Union officials, Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert Fico, shook hands with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin before becoming the only EU leader to attend Russia’s 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine.Ukrainian authorities claim to have busted a Hungarian spy ring operating on its territory, alleging that Budapest was collecting sensitive military data with one eye on a possible future incursion into the west of the country.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said North Korea’s involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war was justified, calling it an exercise of sovereign rights in defence of a “brother nation,” state media KCNA reported on Saturday. Kim also said Pyongyang would not hesitate to authorise the use of military force if the United States persists in military provocations against Russia.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/10/ultrasound-diagnosis-could-lead-to-faster-treatment-of-endometriosis",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 02:02",
            "content": "People showing symptoms of endometriosis should be offered diagnosis options such as ultrasound so they receive treatment sooner, according to updated guidelines.Endometriosis can take years to be diagnosed, as it has previously meant waiting for a surgical procedure to make the diagnosis.The condition can cause severe pain, infertility and heavy periods – and occurs when cells similar to the lining of the uterus grow in other parts of the body. As well as women, endometriosis also affects other people with a uterus and a small number of men.The living evidence guideline for endometriosis, published on Saturday by Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (Ranzcog), recommends that a transvaginal ultrasound be used as the first-line investigation or, if not appropriate, a pelvic MRI.The recommendations are based on emerging evidence suggesting that a greater number of cases can be diagnosed with these non-invasive techniques with increasing accuracy.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe guideline replaces the first clinical practice guidelines published by Ranzcog in 2021. A “living” guideline means recommendations are updated based on the latest research and emerging evidence.Historically, the gold standard of diagnosing endometriosis was to take tissue from a patient during an operation and review it under a microscope. But research from a variety of groups shows ultrasound can detect deep infiltrating endometriosis with “excellent” sensitivity, said Dr Marilla Druitt, a guideline developer.However this method does have limitations to detect superficial disease, she said.While a traditional ultrasound looks at uterus, tubes and ovaries, a new Medicare item number for an endometriosis ultrasound will become available from November which will look for endometriosis tissue in places outside the uterus, including the ligament that holds the uterus to the inside of someone’s pelvis.“That Medicare item number will hopefully drive more thorough looking and more thorough assessment,” Druitt said. But in order for more patients with endometriosis to access it, more sonographers will need to gain accreditation, she said.Offering ultrasound first to diagnose endometriosis means patients don’t have to endure long wait lists for surgery before they can start accessing treatments, whether for sub-fertility or persistent pain.The guidelines recommend starting “with treatment and diagnosis in a parallel fashion, so there is absolutely no reason to delay treatment, which is the problem”, Druitt said.The guidelines will also support GPs to begin first-line hormonal treatment while diagnostic investigations are under way, with primary care specific resources to improve access to key evidence-based recommendations.Prof Danielle Mazza, the head of the department of general practice at Monash University and member of the guideline development group, said “having clear, evidence-based tools like the quick reference guide and flowchart will be a gamechanger for primary care”.The guidelines also now recommend physiotherapy and psychology care as potentially useful for people with pelvic pain and endometriosis.The updated guidelines also say that people with endometriosis requesting information about cancer risk in reproductive organs should be informed “that although they may have a small increase in ovarian and endometrial cancer, the increase in absolute risk compared with women in the general population is low; and that they may have a reduced risk of cervical cancer”.Druitt said many other inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn’s or rheumatoid arthritis, are also associated with a slightly higher cancer risk, but when it comes to endometriosis “the fact that you need that massive data to be able to prove that association tells us something about the absolute risk is still pretty jolly small”.New resources for patients have also been developed.Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotionAlexis Wolfe, consumer liaison on the guideline development group, said the resources will give people information that would help them advocate for themselves and participate more confidently in decision-making with care providers.When it comes to the two different types of surgical treatments for endometriosis – ablation or excision – the guidelines state “existing evidence does not support one technique over the other, with the exception of endometrioma [cysts on the ovaries]” with the certainty of evidence being identified as “low”.The guidelines strongly recommend excision rather than ablation to treat endometriomas.Jess Taylor, the chair of peak body the Australian Coalition for Endometriosis (ACE), said having a living guideline was “critical” because endometriosis has a lot of new research activity. It was historically under-researched compared to other conditions, she said.While supportive living guidelines for health professionals and patients, Taylor said it was disappointing Ranzcog did not allow open consultation to the public.“We requested formal sector consultation … and we followed that up multiple times, and it’s disappointing that did not happen for a guide as important as this,” Taylor said.A Ranzcog spokesperson said they “undertook sector consultation over a three-week period and extensions were granted where possible. The ACE requested a longer extension, which was not possible due to publication timelines.The spokesperson said the timelines were made in agreement with the federal department of health who was the funder.“We are now working with ACE and the Department of Health to ensure that ACE’s feedback can be incorporated into the next updates.”Syl and Lesley Freedman, co-founders EndoActive, said the guidelines “reflect a deeper shift toward more inclusive, patient-centred care”.“We are pleased to see clear recognition that hysterectomy is not a cure for endometriosis or adenomyosis,” the pair said in a joint statement.“However, we are disappointed that the 2025 Guidelines still fail to state that pregnancy is not a cure or treatment for endo. This harmful myth continues to be perpetuated.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 02:01",
            "content": "The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, was arrested for alleged trespass at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in New Jersey on Friday and released after several hours.Baraka was released shortly after 8pm and, after stepping out of an SUV with flashing emergency lights, told waiting supporters: “The reality is this: I didn’t do anything wrong.”News of Baraka’s arrest at Delaney Hall was reported on X by Alina Habba, the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey, and a former personal attorney and adviser to Donald Trump.“The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the Ice detention center in Newark, New Jersey this afternoon,” Habba wrote.“He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody. No one is above the law.”Baraka has opposed the construction and opening of the 1,000-bed detention center, arguing that it should not be allowed to open because of building permit issues.Linda Baraka, the mayor’s wife, accused the federal government of targeting her husband.“They didn’t arrest anyone else. They didn’t ask anyone else to leave. They wanted to make an example out of the mayor,” she said, adding that she had not been allowed to see him.A crowd gathered to protest outside the building where Baraka was being held, with many chanting: “Let the mayor go!”When federal officials blocked his entry, a heated argument broke out, according to Viri Martinez, an activist with the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It continued even after Baraka returned to the public side of the gates.“There was yelling and pushing,” Martinez said. “Then the officers swarmed Baraka. They threw one of the organizers to the ground. They put Baraka in handcuffs and put him in an unmarked car.”The New Jersey Globe published a photograph of him being led away in handcuffs by officers in jackets marked “Police Ice”. The newspaper did not have a reporter at the scene, but said observers at Delaney Hall said there had been “a scuffle”.Baraka, who spoke out against Trump’s immigration policies in January after an immigration raid in Newark he said Ice agents conducted without a warrant, was at Delaney Hall with Democratic New Jersey Congress members Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez.The politicians have accused the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of reopening the detention facility, in contravention of local ordinances and without the necessary permits.It is the largest such facility in the north-eastern US, and was the first to open after Trump’s second term of office began in January, according to the Ice website.Coleman, in a tweet, said the visit was an attempt to establish conditions inside. “We’ve heard stories of what it’s like in other Ice prisons. We’re exercising our oversight authority to see for ourselves,” she wrote.Coleman also told reporters at a press conference outside the facility that the lawmakers had traveled to the facility to see the conditions, according to the Independent.“Ice is out of control,” she said. “Ice thinks it can intimidate all of us. And it cannot intimidate any of us. And we the people will make sure that this administration adheres to the rules that separate us from dictatorships and other third world countries.”Menendez accused Ice agents of having “put their hands on” representatives Coleman and McIver, reported the New York Times. “They feel no restraint on what they should be doing, and that was shown in broad daylight today,” Menendez said at the news conference.In video of the altercation shared with the Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not join a tour of the facility because “you are not a Congress member.”Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: “They’re talking about coming back to arrest you.”“I’m not on their property. They can’t come out on the street and arrest me,” Baraka said.Minutes later several Ice agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out “Shame!” Baraka was dragged back through the security gate in handcuffs.Axios reported that Coleman’s office said that they “arrived at Delaney Hall today at about 1pm to exercise their oversight authority as prescribed by law. After a period of explaining the law to the officials at the site they were escorted in.”Video attached to the tweet shows the Congress members inside the grounds of the center talking to employees. Other clips show them being threatened with arrest for trespass by uniformed officials.Associated Press contributed to this report",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/jay-bratt-trump-deposition",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 01:52",
            "content": "The former special counsel prosecutor Jay Bratt is scheduled to appear before the Republican-led House judiciary committee next week as it attempts to find instances of politicization in the federal criminal cases brought against Donald Trump, according to three people familiar with the matter.The deposition of Bratt, who led the criminal case over Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents as a top deputy to the former special counsel Jack Smith, has been scheduled for 10am ET next Wednesday, according to a notice reviewed by the Guardian.Bratt’s appearance is the first known instance of a special counsel prosecutor being hauled before the judiciary committee since Trump took office vowing revenge and personally directing the firings of more than a dozen prosecutors who worked for Smith within days of his inauguration.It was not clear how long the deposition might last and whether Bratt planned to invoke any privileges to avoid testifying. A spokesperson for the judiciary committee did not immediately respond to questions about the deposition.Smith charged Trump in two cases: in Florida, for mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club and defying a subpoena commanding their return; and in Washington, for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.The classified documents case was dismissed before it went to trial by the US district judge Aileen Cannon, who ruled that Smith had been unlawfully appointed because he was acting with the powers of a “principal officer” at the justice department, which requires confirmation by the US Senate.The topics that House investigators have prepared for Bratt were also not clear. But the judiciary committee, led by Republican chair Jim Jordan, has long believed that the special counsel cases were the result of political animus against Trump at the justice department.In repeated letters to the former special counsel last year, House investigators demanded information from Smith about contacts between the Biden White House and the justice department about the criminal cases, including when Bratt once travelled to the White House.They also sought documents and communications about meetings between FBI and justice department officials before the decision was made to ask a magistrate judge for a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. Bratt is widely understood to have encouraged FBI leaders to obtain a warrant.The warrant later proved to be the basis for the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice charges against Trump; the FBI retrieved 101 classified documents despite Trump’s lawyers having previously claimed that they had complied with an earlier subpoena to return all classified materials.The House judiciary committee has also taken a special interest in a fraught and disputed meeting between then-Trump legal team attorney Stanley Woodward and Bratt at justice department headquarters during the height of the classified documents case in November 2022.The Guardian previously reported on the complaint that Woodward filed in federal district court in Washington about the meeting, where he alleged Bratt discussed Woodward’s application to be a judge while trying to get the cooperation of Walt Nauta, Trump’s valet and Woodward’s client.In the filing, Woodward alleged that Bratt told him he did not think Woodward was a “Trump guy” and that “he would do the right thing” and get Nauta to testify against Trump in the classified documents case.The allegation was that Bratt had engaged in possible misconduct by suggesting Woodward’s judgeship application might be considered more favorably if he convinced his client to flip. The matter was referred to the justice department’s office of professional responsibility but it does not appear as though any action was taken.The extent of any potential impact on the case was unclear, since the meeting did not appear to have directly affected any testimony Nauta gave to prosecutors, and Bratt would not have had the ability to influence such an application, which is handled by the White House counsel’s office.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/who-is-gen-asim-munir-army-chief-leading-pakistan-military-over-india-crisis",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 01:48",
            "content": "In the 77 years since Pakistan was established, its affairs and politics have long been governed by the whims of powerful military generals.Yet even now that the country is out of the clutches of martial law, it is still widely understood that the most powerful man in Pakistan is not the head of the government but instead the chief of the army.Since Gen Asim Munir took over as Pakistan’s army chief more than two years ago, he has been accused of quietly consolidating greater power without even having to topple the country’s civilian rulers. As he kept himself largely out of the limelight, he established an iron grip over the army’s ranks and bent government policy and even the supreme court to his will.Yet in recent weeks, as arch-enemies Pakistan and India have come closer to all-out war than they have in decades, all eyes have been on Munir. After India launched its most intensive airstrikes on Pakistan since the 1971 war in the early hours of Wednesday, hitting nine targets and killing 31 people including children, Pakistan has vowed to respond to this “act of war”.India’s initial strikes on Wednesday were a direct retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a tour guide.Pakistan’s military was swiftly granted complete authorisation by the government to decide how respond to the Indian attack. The decisions for any retaliation plan will now be largely shaped by Munir. On Saturday morning, after India was accused of firing missiles at three Pakistani military bases, Pakistan said they had begun their counterattack.One figure familiar with discussions being held by senior Pakistani military leadership said: “The message from the Pakistan side it is that they are going to hit back very strongly to the Indian provocation.”It was verified by another senior security source in Pakistan. “It will come in a big way. When we do it, everyone will know. Munir is waiting for the right time for the big blow to be delivered,” he said.Munir is known to cut an unusual figure for an army chief. Rather than coming from an elite military family, his fled to India during partition and his father was a teacher. Munir entered the army through the officers’ training school rather than the more prestigious route of Pakistan’s military academy. However, he worked his way up the ranks quickly, becoming the director of military intelligence in 2016, followed by the director general of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), one of the most powerful military roles, in 2018.It was here he fell foul of the then-prime minister, Imran Khan. After Munir reportedly briefed Khan that his new wife-to-be was allegedly implicated in corruption, Khan furiously removed Munir from his post as ISI chief in 2019, beginning a highly acrimonious battle between Khan and the powerful generals.However, Munir was moved to another senior military post and was selected by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, to become the new army chief in 2022.By this time, Khan had succeeded in turning large swathes of the country against the military, which for decades had commanded a devout loyalty among the masses. As Khan, the country’s most popular political leader, was jailed and the 2024 election was marred with allegations of rigging against Khan’s party, it was widely felt the crackdown was the work of Munir, who also ruthlessly purged the military of all Khan loyalists.Yet some analysts said that the recent aggression from India may have presented Munir with an opportunity. As hyper-nationalist fervour has gripped Pakistan, with calls for all-out war with India, the military has been back in favour, with calls for Munir to stand up for the whole of Pakistan.Aqil Shah, a professor on south Asian affairs at Georgetown University, said: “As army chief, he has already been quite brutal – Khan in jail, the election rigged, civilians facing military trial – which has dented his reputation. But a military response that is seen as appropriate to this crisis could reduce the stain of political repression and allow him to burnish his credentials as an army chief who stood up to arch enemy India.”Munir’s own ideology on India is known to be hardline. Like many in the army, he subscribes to the “two nation theory”: that the Muslims of Pakistan fundamentally cannot live in the same country as Hindus. In comments made last month, which were seen as highly antagonistic to India, he said that “our religions are different, our cultures are different, our traditions are different, our thoughts are different, our ambitions are different”.He has also proved bullish and unyielding in the face of antagonism and militant activity from neighbouring Iran and Afghanistan, launching retaliatory cross-border strikes on both countries in the past year.The retired general Muhammad Saeed, the former chief of general staff (CGS), said: “I have served with him for many years, I know Gen Asim Munir is a fearless man. The government has given the nod to him to plan the response [to India] but it won’t be only his decision. When he makes the plan, he will go in all guns blazing.”In terms of their military might along the contested border, while India’s army is around double the size of Pakistan’s – about 1.2 million active Indian personnel compared with about 650,000 for Pakistan – the two sides are “fairly evenly balanced”, said Sushant Singh, an author and political science lecturer at Yale who spent two decades in the Indian army.Singh emphasised that, since 2020, India had deployed huge amounts of military personnel and resources towards its mountainous border with China, after the India-China border crisis swiftly escalated. India has also had issues with the modernisation of its armed forces and faced a systematic recruitment problem, leading to a shortfall of soldiers.“Despite its size, India doesn’t have the kind of dominance where you would expect India to easily ride roughshod over Pakistan or declare a quick win,” said Singh.While Pakistan’s rank and file is widely seen, even among Indian generals, to be disciplined and high-performing, Singh said the issue had always lain at the top: “The major problem is that Pakistan’s senior military leadership is heavily politicised and has often acted out of ideology or religious conservatism or even delusional behaviour.”“Gen Munir is clearly under a lot of political pressure,” he added. “There is also pressure from the co-commanders for him to act strongly so as to be able to demonstrate and restore the credibility of the army as an institution.”The question of who would have the edge in any confrontation is also a question of equipment. In recent years, India has been shifting away from its reliance on Russian weapons to buying western munitions, including elite French Rafale jet planes and F-16 jets from the US. Pakistan now buys 80% of its military arsenal from China.According to reports, as tensions with India rose last month, China rushed 100 more of its more advanced PL-15 missiles to Pakistan, which it usually keeps for its own inventory.On Friday, the Pakistan army claimed it used the PL-15 missiles to bring down several Indian jets during Wednesday’s strikes. Shuja Nawaz, the author of Crossed Swords and a known expert on Pakistan’s military, said this showed that “China is not only helping Pakistan, but it is using it as a kind of testing ground for its weaponry against India.”For Nawaz, the use of precision strikes and unmanned drones on both sides made this conflict unlike any other in India and Pakistan’s bitter history, and made the chance of high-risk escalation even greater.“Munir really doesn’t have an opportunity to play a very long game in the current situation. He has to prove fairly quickly that he and the military are prepared and that they will defend the country,” he said.The concerns of a nuclear escalation had also never been higher, he said. “India and Pakistan don’t fight long wars, they fight short wars. And they throw everything that they have in the shop window into battle. My biggest fear is that Pakistan utilises what they call tactical nuclear weapons – and then all hell breaks loose.”",

            "content": "Until last week’s federal election, Daria Taplin-Buck had always voted Liberal.The 31-year-old, who moved from Russia to Australia as a teenager, had been a dues-paying member of the Young Liberals for years. During the 2019 election campaign, she could be found door-knocking in Adelaide, and outside a polling booth handing out how-to-vote cards for the Liberal party.But this time around, she cast her ballot for Labor.“What were they offering?” she says of the Liberals. “I didn’t understand.”Labor’s campaign was “way better”, she says, and clearer on what the party offered, with its housing and Hecs policies appealing to her most.From the Liberals, she saw “a lot of just negative things: ‘oh, we’ll cancel this, cancel that, going back to the office, no work from home.’“I know quite a few people, even in my family, who switched for this election.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailTaplin-Buck, who describes herself as “conservative, but centre-right, not too rightwing”, wants to return to voting Liberal – her natural political home. But she says the party’s meagre policy offerings, lack of female representation – she would have voted Liberal if the party had fielded a female candidate in her seat – and Peter Dutton’s leadership all turned her off.“[He] is not very appealing to women,” she says. “He’s one of those hard, boomer old guys. You don’t want to vote for them.”Taplin-Buck is emblematic of a vast and obvious problem facing the Liberal party, one that has prompted much discussion in the week since the Coalition’s thumping election loss: how to win back women.But she also represents a problem besetting conservative women: as the Liberal party has increasingly alienated, sidelined and lost the support of women, where do centre-right-voting, conservative-leaning women go? Can the Liberal party be their home any more?Last week’s disastrous result for the Coalition confirmed the Liberal party’s loss of female voters, identified after its 2022 election loss, was not a one-off blip.A review of the defeat by Senator Jane Hume and the former federal Liberal director Brian Loughnane found that a majority of women in all age segments preferred Labor, and the party’s two-party preferred vote was the weakest among young women aged 18-34.“It hasn’t been an easy decade to be telling people that you’re a Liberal woman. Sometimes, people have this kind of pity on you because they assume that you don’t have enough self-respect,” says former the Liberal staffer Charlotte Mortlock, a journalist who runs Hilma’s Network, which aims to connect Liberal women and get more women preselected.Mortlock says the attitudes of centre-right women she has spoken to since last week’s election have ranged from “white-hot rage” to exhaustion.For her personally, there was also embarrassment. After the 2022 election, she says there was a feeling the “women’s problem” within the party was largely to do with Scott Morrison’s leadership, but that after his departure, the party was ready to take women’s concerns seriously.“I feel really embarrassed that when we got to the election, all of that evaporated.”She says “systemic flaws” in the party need to be addressed, from the grassroots to the top of leadership, from preselection to policy creation.“This has to be a watershed moment,” she says. “Unless [the party] fix it this time, I think a lot of people will start to walk away. We’ve already seen voters do that, but I believe that Liberal members that are women will also do that.”Key among the issues that need addressing, Mortlock says, is female representation.In 2022, the Liberal party recorded the lowest number of women in its parliamentary ranks in 30 years, with just nine women (21%) among its 42 MPs, and 10 women out of 26 senators (38%). This is despite the parliament then having a record number of women.In 2021, Morrison, then prime minister, called for the party to consider quotas, supported by the Western Australian MP Melissa Price and NSW senator Andrew Bragg.Hume said she was “open” to a discussion at the time, then recommended 50-50 targets in her review.Labor introduced quotas for women in 1994, requiring women to be preselected for 35% of winnable seats (the numbers have changed over the decades). In the outgoing parliament, 47% of Labor MPs, 70% of Labor senators and 53% of overall representatives were women.This year’s election drubbing – projected to bring a new record of elected women – has the Liberal party talking about gender quotas again.The NSW Liberal women’s council president, Berenice Walker, says she has historically been “resistant” to quotas, but now is the time for change.“It is evident that what we’re doing hasn’t moved the dial at all far enough, so I would now be open to looking at that [quotas],” she says.Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotion“The time for change within our party was years ago; we haven’t taken on board the learnings from past election reviews, and we’ve failed to refresh and grow the Liberal party brand.“Our membership needs to reflect the diversity of the population. We have twice as many male young Liberals as we do women, and most of our membership is over 60.”Mortlock has experienced this disconnect first-hand in branch meetings, which she says need to cater “to different life stages”.“There’s no disrespect, but people in their 70s aren’t reading the same books or watching the same TV shows as people in their 30s … [They] aren’t experiencing the same life experience.”She is a strong supporter of gender quotas. “You need the women at the table to generate the policy,” she says.“I’m not saying as soon as [voters] see a photo where [the party has] half women, half men, they’ll vote for us. I’m saying, we can’t come up with the policies if we don’t have the right people at the table.”In Guardian Australia on Wednesday, the Liberal senator and former NSW Liberal president Maria Kovacic wrote: “Of course we should be considering quotas. This is not about ticking boxes – it’s about removing entrenched barriers and making space for talent we have long overlooked.”Anna Finizio ran as the Liberal candidate in a 2024 byelection in the South Australian state seat of Dunstan. She says that when she was door-knocking, people told her: “We really like you, but we just don’t like the leader of your party.”“There’s a bigger problem than policy, and that’s perception of the party,” Finizio says.Finizio, a 39-year-old lawyer and policy adviser for the South Australian opposition leader, Vincent Tarzia, says she is precisely the sort of candidate the Liberal party is being called on to preselect: a young, professional woman.“There’s a lot of women like me out there; I’m not a unicorn. I’m just someone who is socially progressive; I want to see great opportunity in Adelaide. I’m a professional woman … I just don’t see that in the parliament right now, which is really disappointing.”It’s why she wants to run. But running under the Liberal banner, so damaged in the eyes of many voters, is difficult. And the federal result spelled fear for next year’s South Australian election, when she has been endorsed to run for Dunstan.“It’s really clear that we’ve lost relevance. We don’t resonate with demographics, in particular women and young people. So I think there’s a lot of work to do.”Finizio is not opposed to quotas, but believes they are a “blunt instrument” that should have been introduced in the 1990s alongside Labor’s. “Even if we get a hard 50% quota … we don’t have really many safe seats any more, so … what’s the incentive for good professional women to go into politics? At the moment, there isn’t one, right?”It’s time for “soul-searching”, she says. “The only way we’re going to change the culture of the Liberal party is to change the membership … If we want to be a viable political party, we’ve got to start acting and thinking like one.”Mortlock says the next three months or so will be critical for members of her network deciding if they can continue to call the Liberal party home.One thing they’ll be watching particularly closely, she says, is the direction of its leadership.“If, you know, it’s Angus Taylor, or if it’s Sussan Ley, and the first thing they do is get up and say, ‘We don’t have a women’s issue, it’s just about our messaging,’ everyone’s going to roll their eyes and not bother.“At this point, it’s like, cool, if you think that the way to fix this is by putting Angus Taylor in … and continuing to not address the women’s issue, then fill your boots.“But enjoy oblivion.”",

            "content": "Composting food waste rather than sending it to landfill drastically reduces household waste and emissions. From the old-school compost heap to worm farms and council Fogo (food organics and garden organics) bins, there are options to suit everyone, including those in small apartments. Here’s how to start.Composting is the process of recycling organic matter (garden waste, food scraps and more) into a nutrient-rich mixture used to enrich soil. This contrasts starkly with organics rotting in landfill: buried under other waste, they decompose anaerobically (without oxygen), producing a lot of methane (a potent greenhouse gas), as well as the toxic sludge of leachate.Studies show composting organics produces far fewer emissions than sending them to landfill, decreasing CO2 equivalent gases by more than 50% depending on method, conditions and food type.Around 3% of Australia’s emissions come from food waste, with household food waste accounting for almost one-third. And around half of what goes into household bins could be composted instead.Rachel Kernaghan, ecological education manager at Sydney’s innovative waste and recycling centre, Kimbriki, says an important first step is rethinking your approach to food and shopping. Her suggestions include weekly menu plans, grocery lists and smarter, less frequent shopping, as well as cooking and eating to use up what you’ve got.There are hundreds of different composting solutions on the market, designed to suit different situations, tastes and budgets. Things to consider include: the size of your outdoor space, amount of household food scraps produced, what you’ll do with the results, and your desired amount of effort. Rebecca Bliss, social impact manager at Sustainability Victoria, says: “Composting doesn’t need to be complicated and it doesn’t need to be expensive. It just needs to be convenient and accessible for people.”The original solution is the compost heap, traditionally a big pile in the corner of the garden. Thanks to our smaller blocks and dislike of smell and rodents, enclosed compost bins (either above or in-ground) and tumblers have taken over. Depending on the model, these can process a lot of waste, producing rich, humus-like soil. There is still the possibility of whiffiness and unwanted pests, and some shovel work is required.Worm farms are another easy, popular choice. Basically a set of stacking plastic boxes filled with wrigglers, they turn scraps into nutrient-rich worm juice emptied via an in-built tap. Available in different sizes and styles, they’re generally low-maintenance, low-pong and small, suitable for courtyards and balconies. However, worms can’t process the same volume as a compost, are fussier in terms of scrap type and size, and more sensitive to heat.Bokashi bins ferment food scraps through the addition of enzymes. The end result is nitrogen-rich liquid (great for fertilising plants) and “pickled” waste that needs to be dug into soil or added to compost. Suitable for indoor use, the plastic tubs take up little space and process scraps that other systems won’t – citrus, meat, onion and more.Sign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionIf none of these solutions suit, donating your food scraps to a composting program via a community garden, school or scheme is another option. The best place to start is with your local council.Where available, industrial compost systems are the easiest option of all. Councils collect Food Organics and Garden Organics (Fogo) bins along with other kerbside bins, transporting the waste to industrial facilities. These large-scale services can process most organic matter, from bones to compostable packaging, with the resulting compost used in parks and agriculture. The Fogo bins are a good adjunct to household composting, taking in organic matter you can’t process at home.Help is at hand navigating the wide array of choices. Composting workshops are offered by everyone from councils to gardening groups, often offering discounted products. Then there are bigger organisations such as Compost Revolution, a social venture that works with local councils to remove barriers to composting, including cost, knowledge and guidance, and supports councils’ e-commerce, logistics and marketing. As well as delivering discounted products direct to people’s doors, Compost Revolution helps match a household’s situation to an ideal solution via a quiz and educational tutorials, as well as ongoing support.“What we do is help people choose the right composting system for their needs, with easy tutorials and support,” says David Gravina, Compost Revolution’s founder. “Home composting keeps nutrients local, supports people to reduce their waste and encourages people to reconnect with nature’s cycle, while getting physically fit and emotionally nourished – intrinsic benefits you don’t get from industrial systems.”However, more important than how you compost is that you do it at all.Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

            "content": "Michael Mayne does not know precisely when he acquired a brain injury. It may have been in one of two serious motorcycle accidents, or – as he suspects – the consequence of decades of drug use, or a combination of all three. But he knows when it was diagnosed: he was 47 and he had just come out of prison – and not for the first time.An estimated 2% of Australians have an acquired brain injury (ABI). The most common causes are accidents, trauma, stroke, and foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. But among the prison population, the prevalence of ABI is astronomically high, leading legal experts to argue that the system that is supposed to be providing justice is effectively criminalising disability instead.A 2011 study estimated that 42% of male prisoners and 33% of female prisoners in Victoria had an ABI. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that nationally, the prevalence may be as high as 90%. But despite people with ABI being disproportionately represented in prison, there are few screening processes to identify them along the way and little if any available support.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMayne hopes to change that. He’s one of four people who have shared their stories for a new podcast, All Been Inside, exploring the different ways the justice system traps people with ABI into a cycle of criminalisation. The podcast is the product of Voices for Change – a self-advocacy group for people with ABI who have had contact with the justice system – and Fitzroy Legal Service.“What I know now, if I knew it back then, I’d be a completely different person,” Mayne says.Mayne had been in trouble with the law since he was a kid, starting off in juvenile detention for motorbike-related offences at age 13. He really “spiralled out of control” after the deaths of his parents, just two months apart from each other, when he was 18, and his drug use began to escalate, as did his crimes: car theft, burglary, armed robbery.“The amounts of heroin I was pumping into myself – I was spending sometimes $1,500 a day,” Mayne, 57, says. He overdosed “a couple of times”; he crashed his motorbike; he went in and out of prison repeatedly.A doctor first suggested to Mayne that he might have an ABI during one of those prison stints. About a decade ago, with the help of his GP, he found out for sure.“Having an ABI, I feel like a second-class citizen because I don’t understand a lot of things. I taught myself in jail how to read by reading the newspaper,” Mayne says in the podcast. “If there was some way they could have screened me to see if I had an ABI I think my time might have been shorter and a lot different.”Jai Haines knew about his ABI from the start. He was 19 when he misjudged a corner on his motorbike. The bike collided with the tree first, and his head followed – an impact so powerful it split his helmet in two.Before the accident, the young Tommeginne man had played state-level gridiron, been a good student, and planned to join the army. But medical testing soon confirmed a brain injury, and Haines’s world was profoundly altered.“Sitting in the hospital and having to do all these cognitive skill things, and I just couldn’t concentrate … As much as I wanted to try so hard, I just couldn’t do it. And it was making me feel really angry,” Haines, now 45, says. “I ended up just hitting the drugs really hard, started drinking a lot, and that led to me doing crime.”It would take many years, a mini-stroke, a compassionate lawyer – “she talked to me in a way that made me feel like I was valid” – and similarly compassionate judge to help him turn his life around. “His name was Judge Hardy, and it was the way he spoke to me. He knew that I was a better person,” Haines said. “He actually sat down [with me] … and he goes, ‘I’m not going to set you up to fail, mate’.”Stan Winford, a researcher and legal expert at RMIT University’s Centre for Innovative Justice, says it usually takes multiple encounters with the system for people with an ABI to have their injury identified, let alone addressed. And even when people know it, disclosure isn’t always in their best interests.Sign up to Five Great ReadsEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

The department had no method of capturing that information when a person came through the door, and long waitlists for only limited services, the report found.The auditor general recommended the department develop mandatory screening processes to identify prisoners with intellectual disability or ABI, train staff accordingly, and monitor prisons to ensure they complied with the support requirements for people with disability.The Victorian department of justice did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment about whether it had implemented recommendations from the auditor-general.Each episode of All Been Inside includes concrete suggestions for helping people with ABI out of the vicious loop of criminalisation. For Haines and Mayne, getting involved with Voices for Change was an integral part of breaking that cycle.“I found it really difficult at times, but I stuck through it,” Haines says. “Now I’ve got this passion, I’ve got this empathy. I’ve got so much inside me that I can give back to my community, because I know how much I did wrong and I can’t change my past, but what I do today will show the person that I am now.”“One of the best things I’ve done in my life is joining that group,” Mayne says. “People say to me, what’s it like to have your life back? I say, well, I haven’t got my life back; now I’ve actually got a life, you know?”In Australia, the National Alcohol and Other Drug Hotline is at 1800 250 015; families and friends can seek help at Family Drug Support Australia at 1300 368 186.

            "content": "As Climate 200 founder Simon Holmes à Court sees it, there are no safe seats or silver medals in politics.The political fundraising body Climate 200 supported 35 community independents – commonly called teals though some shirk that tag – in this year’s federal election. Nine have won, while votes are still being counted in other seats where teals are contenders.In 2019, the independent Zali Steggall famously ousted Tony Abbott from Warringah, joining a crossbench featuring Helen Haines, Andrew Wilkie and Rebekha Sharkie. But it was in 2022 that the teal wave washed through parliament.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailMany have posited that the teal appeal was, at least in part, a response to Scott Morrison’s deep unpopularity and his Liberal government’s “women problem”. But Labor and the Greens are not immune.The vote for independents has gone up from 5.3% in 2022 to more than 7% this year.In Bean, the independent Jessie Price is a whisker ahead of Labor incumbent David Smith. In Bradfield, a similarly tiny difference puts Liberal candidate Gisele Kapterian just in front of Nicolette Boele. In Kooyong, MP Monique Ryan is battling to hold on against the Liberal candidate Amelia Hamer.Zoe Daniel initially celebrated winning Goldstein, but Liberal candidate Tim Wilson – who lost it to the independent in 2022 – later claimed victory. The independent Kate Hulett gave Labor MP Josh Wilson a fright in Fremantle.The electoral analyst and blogger Ben Raue says typically there’s a “sophomore surge” with independents, where name recognition sees their vote go up at the second election. “That largely hasn’t happened,” he says, but adds “they’ve done reasonably well”.Thanks to the independents creating a three-way competition in some seats, vote counting is more complicated, he says.“Even where they don’t win they’re keeping it interesting,” Raue says.Raue says climate change was not on the agenda as much this year compared with 2022, which could explain the more subdued support for the teals, who campaign on climate action, gender equity and political integrity.But he says overall the rise of the independents has been a “transformation”. “It used to be all about minor parties. There were a few independents in the parliament, but now it’s much more of a wave.”The polling analyst Kevin Bonham makes the same point about the lack of a sophomore surge, and says there is no “startling pattern” in the results so far.“The independent vote is up but that’s because there were more of them running in more seats,” he says.“Let’s wait and see where they end up in terms of how many seats they win. I guess the worst possible result would be losing a couple, but it’s not a greatly different result to what happened last time.”Holmes à Court says the independents are “here to stay”.“The fact that so many of the independents kept their seats shows that the movement was not a blip,” he says.“A record number of independents [have come] within striking distance of a win.“There’s no silver medal in politics, but if there were medals, at least 22 community-selected independents would be walking away with a gold or silver.”There are other, non-teal independents, of course – such as Dai Le, who looks likely to stay on in Fowler. And there are others who managed respectable primary votes and could pose a future threat.Sign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionThe onward march of the independents, though, could be hobbled by electoral funding laws that the two major parties joined together to pass in February.At the time, the Centre for Public Integrity said the speedy passage of the laws – which went through without the scrutiny of a public inquiry – were an “affront to our democratic process”.The new rules will cap political donations and election campaign spending, increase transparency around donations and – from the 2028 election – increase the public funding per vote.The move was pitched as a way to rein in “big money” such as that deployed by the mining magnate Clive Palmer, who spends tens of millions of dollars on election campaigns. But crossbenchers described it as a “stitch-up” that would advantage Labor and the Coalition over the independents and minor parties.The $50,000 cap on the amount a donor can give to a party or individual can be sidestepped using multiple donations to the various sub-groups that the major parties have, and there’s a carve out for peak bodies such as unions and business councils.There’s also a spending cap of $800,000 for each candidate, but the independents argue established parties have plentiful access to resources and staff which they don’t. And a boost of about $3 to $5 for each vote for candidates who get at least 4% of first-preference votes will advantage incumbents, they say.Holmes à Court describes the new laws as a “financial gerrymander” on the income and the expenditure side.“It will be tougher, because there’s now one rule for independents and another rule for the parties,” he says.But he adds that independent candidates aren’t going to walk away, just because they got silver this time.“We put out a [documentary] earlier this year called No Safe Seat. I think that’s the theme of the election,” he says.“In the ‘class of 2022’, all seven won formerly safe seats. The difference between losing a couple of seats and gaining a few is plus or minus 1000 votes in half a dozen seats.“Politics is brutal.”",

            "content": "Australia’s participation in next year’s Venice Biennale remains under a cloud. With Creative Australia holding fast to its decision to cancel its commission of artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino, it’s becoming increasingly likely that the Australian Pavilion might remain dark in 2026.It is an added weight for the First Nations team who have unveiled their new creation inside the pavilion as part of Venice’s other biennale: the Venice Biennale of Architecture, held every other year in the Giardini.The seven designers, collectively working under the moniker The Creative Sphere, are the first all Indigenous team Australia has sent to Venice. Tasked with introducing Indigenous concepts of building, design and connection to Country to the world, they have painstakingly reconstructed their rammed-earth, 4.8 metre by nine metre prototype called Home, first created at the University of Sydney.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHand-built from scratch from sustainable materials – clay, plaster and plywood – sourced from within the Veneto region, Home’s construction relied on barges travelling up Venice’s canals and off-loading at the base of the Australian pavilion’s elevated site. From there, wheelbarrows and makeshift ramps were the only means of transporting the building materials inside.Home’s walls are made from 139 individually cast plaster panels, each of which required a minimum of five to six people to make.“The oils of our skins are embedded throughout this entire exhibition,” says Worimi and Biripi Guri architect Jack Gillmer-Lilley, of SJB Architecture in Sydney and part of The Creative Sphere.It is his hope that Home will encourage each visitor to the Australian Pavilion to embrace their unique relationship with the concept of home.“For me, the definition keeps changing, it’s not tangible,” he says. “I never had a stable home growing up. There was lot of family trauma, there’s a lot of stories of happiness, a lot of sadness and we were always moving around. Home for me is where I can feel connected with my family, regardless of where in the world I am at the time.”For Quandamooka architect Bradley Kerr, home used to be “where Mum is”; now the father-of-two defines home as wherever he can “share in his son’s smile and stupid fart jokes”.“We didn’t want to impose a feeling or an image or an idea on to people,” he adds. “We wanted people to find something they relate to and connect to, because for us as First Nations people, it’s one of the ways that we relate to and connect with each other, and it’s something that we felt we really needed to share within this space.”The Creative Sphere team were working when the news broke that Sabsabi and Dagostino had been sacked by Creative Australia, the producers of their biennale project (with the Australian Institute of Architects, which commissions them). The architects shared a statement in solidarity with the artist, writing on Instagram: “As First Nations people, we respond to this act of censorship, exclusion and marginalisation with disappointment and concern.”Although the project never started with it in mind, Home became the team’s response to the defeat of the voice referendum in 2023.“We’re still trying to demonstrate that we want to move forward together, and that we want to celebrate and share our culture with Australian people,” says Kerr. “We want to continue to be generous, in spite of all the backlash, the racism that we have to manage and juggle and face on a daily and weekly basis.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotion“People want, and expect, marginalised people to feel all of that deep sadness and trauma. But our strength comes from joy, in spite of all of the challenges that we face. Joy in itself can be an act of resistance.”Last year, a primary school in Sydney’s Darlington took out the highest prize at the World Architectural festival in Singapore, praised for its celebration of the school’s “strong connections to Aboriginal people” and its incorporation of Indigenous art and design . The same architectural firm, FJC Studio, also designed the Yellamundie library in south-west Sydney, which was named one of the world’s four most beautiful new libraries in September.While only 0.3% of architecture students graduating from Australian universities identify as First Nations, multiple projects recently recognised by the AIA have incorporated connection to country at the centre of their design, including Spinifex Hill Project Space, Mildura’s Powerhouse Place, Darwin’s Nungalinya student accommodation project, and the North Head viewing platforms.“We’re getting stronger and stronger engagement with Indigenous place, country and the influence of Indigenous thinking around how buildings work … and how they actually speak to the significance of a place,” former AIA president Stuart Tanner told the Guardian in December.“This is a whole other layer to architecture which is going to, I believe, elevate Australian architecture to a level far beyond what traditionally people might think architects do.”When the Venice Biennale of Architecture concludes, Home will be manually dismantled, all its materials returned to the landscape they came from. No screws, adhesives or metal fixings were used in Home’s construction.“It was a tough build,” Gillmer-Lilley says. “The amount of energy, the amount of emotions that were put in the creation of this … but it gives us a lot of pride and joy in the outcome.”",

            "content": "Joel Cauchi stands on the nature strip outside his parents’ tidy Queenslander home in Toowoomba, waiting for the police.On this day in January 2023, Cauchi is friendly and calm. He tells one of the officers: “I just would like to record a crime, if that’s OK.”The footage, captured by police body-worn cameras and played this week in a coronial inquest, makes for a striking comparison with the images of Cauchi 15 months later when he roamed Westfield in Bondi Junction with a 30cm blade, stabbing six people to death and injuring 10 others.In the 2023 footage, Cauchi has a cordial chat to Sen Const Matthew McDonnell. Cauchi explains he has called the officers to his parents’ home to make a complaint over his dad stealing his “collector’s items” knives. Cauchi says he’s not sure why his dad took the knives – he’s tried to negotiate but his dad is “not willing” to give them back.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailHis mother, who stands closer to the house next to blooming hydrangeas, tells the other officer her version of the story. Cauchi’s weapons are “pigging” knives, she says. His 75-year-old dad took the knives away because Cauchi has been “in a rage” and hearing voices.“When he’s on medication he’s a totally different person,” Cauchi’s mother can be heard telling the officer in body-worn camera footage. “He doesn’t know he is sick.”“I don’t know how we’re going to get him treatment unless he does something drastic.”On 13 April last year, something drastic did happen. Cauchi fatally stabbed Ashlee Good, 38, Jade Young, 47, Yixuan Cheng, 27, Pikria Darchia, 55, Faraz Tahir, 30, and Dawn Singleton, 25, before he was fatally shot by police inspector Amy Scott.This week the coronial inquest into the attack heard Cauchi’s voice for the first time – and about earlier chances to intervene that were not taken.Of the five Queensland police officers who appeared before the inquest this week, two had responded to Cauchi’s call for help the day he alleged his dad stole his knives.They were each asked by senior counsel assisting Peggy Dwyer SC if they agreed with a psychiatrists assessment that this moment was a “missed opportunity”. They all did.“There was no signs he was a threat to himself or others but I believe it warranted further intervention,” McDonnell, who spoke to him that day, told the court on Monday.At the time, Cauchi was not medicated for his schizophrenia, the court heard. He had been weaned off medication by a psychiatrist and was meant to be monitored – but wasn’t.McDonnell emailed a police officer known as the mental health intervention coordinator, or MHIC, explaining the interaction and asked for a follow-up. But the officer, who was acting in the MHIC role at the time, forgot to follow up after becoming caught up with another job.On Tuesday, Sen Sgt Tracey Morris – the officer who had been away at the time and is normally the sole MHIC for a region of 220,000 residents – cried when asked about her colleague, Sen Const Peter McDiarmid, missing the email.“His oversight of [that] email is devastating and is not indicative of him as an officer or how he performed my role,” she told the court.Asked by Dwyer if McDiarmid might have missed the email due to a lack of resources, Morris said: “Absolutely.”Morris explained how that was an ongoing issue hampering her work, and told the court there should be three full-time staff to deal with the workload. She also told the court she struggles to find officers to backfill her role while she’s away. While at the inquest this week, she could not get anyone to cover her.If the officer had followed up, Morris said police would have looked up his past interactions with police and also potentially linked him up with health services after a follow-up conversation with the Cauchi family.But the police were also upfront while giving evidence about their limitations to respond to such incidents and poor resourcing in the health sector.Morris told the court that such people were increasingly dealt with by police because they had nowhere else to turn and that was a problem.“We will always look at it from a policing lens,” Morris said during her evidence. “That may lead to charges and them going through the court system when [it’s] effectively because of the mental illness.”Dwyer said that a change to the Queensland Mental Health Act was “shaping up as a significant recommendation” – specifically, bringing it in line with NSW where police can request an emergency assessment for someone if they are threat to others, not just a serious threat to themselves.However, Sen Const Hope Porter, who spoke to Cauchi’s mother the day of the January 2023 incident, told the court Cauchi did not appear to be a threat to himself or others.“The way Joel presented and the way he spoke and the way he was at the time, like he was well-dressed, he looked after himself … he was living with his parents, he spoke well, you can tell he was educated,” Porter reflected.“He didn’t spend his entire life crazy. He was a high-functioning human being and then he wasn’t. And I don’t know where that decline happened.”Sign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionInsp Bernard Quinlan, the manager of the vulnerable persons group for Queensland police, who gave evidence at the inquest on Tuesday, said police were “not equipped with the skills and knowledge” to respond to mental-health crises alone.“It’s a no-brainer for me that there should be responses that are health-led that can go out and assist people when they need help,” he said.Dwyer read to Quinlan the expert opinion of a psychiatrist who reviewed the body-worn footage, which showed police’s interaction with Cauchi when his father took his knives away. The expert determined Cauchi was “certainly psychotic” and in her view qualified for “compulsory admission” for a mental-health assessment.Asked if that would be the benefit of having a specialist in mental health attend call-outs alongside police, Quinlan said: “I couldn’t agree more.”The court heard that the day after Cauchi reported his dad had stolen his knives, he went to a camping store and bought a new knife.Later in the week, the coronial inquest moved from Cauchi’s history to the day of his attack, a busy Saturday at the mall. It specifically examined the response of security guards, one of whom was fatally stabbed, and what they knew as Cauchi began his rampage.The coronial inquest heard a public emergency announcement warning customers was not issued until 17 minutes after Cauchi killed his sixth and last victim, and 14 minutes after Scott had already shot him dead.When the alarm was activated, which the court heard was the wrong alarm for the situation, Brett Simpson, the first responding paramedic, recalled for the court it was so loud that: “It was both a physical and mental impairment to basically every activity that was taken inside the shopping centre.”Two security guards gave evidence about how the confusing and delayed communications resulted in the slow response from guards, with the radio channel line busy with “chatter” – making it difficult to send and receive information.Much focus in the inquest’s second week was given to the guard in charge of the room with CCTV, with the court hearing concerns were raised about her ability to do the job. When Cauchi began to attack people, she was in the bathroom and not monitoring the 700 CCTV cameras.The guard, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had refresher training in the weeks leading up to the incident, but trainers had flagged she was “not getting better”.A manager of the security firm was asked by counsel assisting on Friday what he thinks of the suggestion that guards “should have done more in terms of confronting the armed offender”. He responded that as soon as they knew it was an armed offender they should have raised the alarm and tried to get people to safety.He told the court that the security guards earn between $26 and $28 an hour.Another guard who cannot be named for legal reasons told the court about how his first instinct when he saw Cauchi’s victims on the ground was to grab privacy screens.Asked by Sue Chrysanthou SC if he got the privacy screens because bystanders were filming the victims, the man said he didn’t recall noticing that. Chrysanthou is acting on behalf of some of the families.“I saw kids around, that was my main concern,” the man explained.“I’m a father, so I saw those kids and I knew just a glimpse would be traumatising,” he said.When he began to perform CPR, he heard Scott fire the shots that killed Cauchi. But in the confusion of the moment, thought he was being shot at.Concluding his evidence on Thursday, he read aloud a note he had written about the ongoing impact, saying only two of his colleagues have been able to return to full-time work.“Not everyone understands the fear and chaos we faced,” he told the inquest. “Many [security guards] showed great courage performing CPR and taking people to safety as best [they] could.”“We go through training and it’s good training but when the scenario actually happens you’re in flight-or-fight mode, and it’s just survival instinct.”“I wish we did better, I wish we did different.”The inquest, scheduled for five weeks, continues.

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/trump-tufts-student-deportation-rumeysa-ozturk",
            "published_at": "2025-05-10 00:32",
            "content": "Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts University student arrested in March for her political speech, has been released from the Louisiana detention center where she was being held in what she and her lawyers had argued was a breach of her constitutional rights.A federal judge on Friday morning had ordered Öztürk’s return to Vermont, where she was briefly held after being grabbed on the street by masked immigration agents near Boston, for hearings. But the judge decided not to wait for her physical transportation and she appeared remotely from Louisiana at the hearing in Burlington on Friday.The ruling to release her came at the end of a hearing where the judge, William Sessions, said that the process by which she was placed in immigration detention “raises very significant due process concerns”.Öztürk could be seen hugging one of her attorneys after the judge ordered her release from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s custody.She was released hours later, her legal team said. The judge will take up arguments in her underlying lawsuit at a later hearing.“We are so relieved that Rümeysa will soon be back in Massachusetts, and won’t stop fighting until she is free for good,” Jessie Rossman, a lawyer for Öztürk at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in a statement.On 25 March, Öztürk, 30, a Turkish national and PhD student studying child development, had been bundled into an unmarked car by agents to be taken away without due process and is battling a deportation order issued by the Trump administration after she co-authored an opinion article in a student newspaper that was critical of Israel.Sessions said her continued detention “potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens. Any one of them may now avoid exercising their first amendment rights for fear of being whisked away to a detention center from their home. For all of those reasons, the court finds that her continued detention cannot stand, that bail is necessary to make the habeas [petition] … effective.”He added: “This is a woman who’s just totally committed to her academic career …there is absolutely no evidence that that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence. She has no criminal record … therefore, the court finds that she does not pose a danger to the community.”He ordered the Trump administration to release Öztürk from custody “immediately” pending further proceedings, and said she was free to “return to her home in Massachusetts”.The administration had been attempting to deport Öztürk under a rarely used immigration statute giving the secretary of state the authority to remove immigrants deemed harmful to US foreign policy.The judge said there was no evidence from the government against Öztürk other than its view of her opinion article and therefore he supported her argument that “the reason that she has been detained is simply and purely the expression that she made … in violation of her first amendment rights.”She appeared on video at the hearing on Friday dressed in a bright orange prison jumpsuit reminiscent of uniforms for terrorism suspects held at Guantánamo Bay.According to court filings, Öztürk had suffered multiple asthma attacks in detention that she has struggled to get treated for, and had her hijab forcibly removed.Following Öztürk’s initial testimony, her doctor, Jessica McCannon, testified about her diagnosis of Öztürk’s asthma. At one point, Öztürk had an asthma attack during McCannon’s testimony, which her lawyers had to interrupt. The judge then excused Öztürk and allowed her to temporarily step out of the room to use the bathroom.Sara Johnson, director of graduate studies at Tufts University’s department of child study and human development, who is also Öztürk’s program adviser, also testified.“Rümeysa is a critical part of our lab … My four PhD students, including Rümeysa, run a peer-review group of all of their work, and they are missing out on her very constructive yet extremely rigorous comments,” she said.She added: “Rümeysa is also a mentor to many more junior students in our department and so they are missing those opportunities to learn from her.”Öztürk’s legal team – which includes the ACLU and Clear (Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility), a legal clinic affiliated with the City University of New York – filed a challenge to her detention, in federal court in Vermont.“I am relieved and ecstatic that Rümeysa has been ordered released. Unfortunately, it is 45 days too late. She has been imprisoned all these days for simply writing an op-ed that called for human rights and dignity for the people in Palestine. When did speaking up against oppression become a crime?” said Mahsa Khanbabai of Khanbabai Immigration Law.Öztürk is one of several international students detained by the Trump administration over their pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus.“The government has spared no effort to evade accountability and deny her due process. Today, the court delivered reprieve and justice,” said Mudassar Toppa, a staff attorney at Clear.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting",

            "content": "On the island of Rotuma in Fiji, Christmas is a time of joy, a celebration bursting with song, dance and laughter. Charlene Erasito remembers watching the festivities there when she was a child, captivated as people paraded through the village for “fara,” a local Christmas celebration.Erasito never imagined that decades later, she would return to the same shores, no longer as a spectator but as a scientist. Erasito, now 30 years old, is the only female Pacific Islander aboard an ambitious expedition seeking to document unexplored ocean ecosystems in Fijian waters.The months-long project, led by National Geographic Pristine Seas, began in April with a crew of local and international experts. It starts with deep sea exploration and will later examine shallower parts of the ocean. The expedition began in Fiji and will also travel to Tuvalu and Tonga.Stepping on the deck of the research vessel last month, Erasito was affectionately nicknamed “Moana” by her crew mates – a title she accepts with a laugh.“It was funny because, as a child, I actually had a pet pig and chicken,” Erasito says, referencing the popular animated Disney film. “Except I named them ‘Pig’ and ‘Chicken’. Zero creativity there.”Erasito is studying for her PhD at the French national institute for ocean science and technology. The invitation to join the expedition came after her research on seamounts – underwater mountains that rise from the sea floor- and biodiversity in New Caledonia impressed the Pristine Seas team. In that project, she used remote-operated vehicles, imagery and acoustic data to explore deep-sea life.She has family links to Rotuma and was “speechless” when asked to join the Fijian project.“I was at work in France when the invitation came. It took me days to process and respond. It was surreal,” she says.“I was thrilled to be going back to sea, but this expedition would be different. We would be exploring deep-sea ecosystems around my home island of Rotuma – something I never imagined I’d have the chance to do” she says.Erasito says it “felt like a duty” to return to the Rotuma, where she remembers travelling as a child for her late father’s work. She had fond memories of swimming, fishing and the beach.“I used to listen to stories of night fishing that my dad would share or different aspects of Rotuma … but mostly the significance of the ocean to Rotuma and her people.”“Every person we met on the island felt like family – whether or not we were actually related. That’s the magic of home.”The expedition has given Erasito experience with new technologies including types of underwater cameras and video tools.“Seeing the deep-sea footage – the fish, the corals, and the life hidden beneath the surface – was incredible. And to know we’re exploring with minimal disruption to these fragile habitats was important to me.”The deep-sea part of the Rotuma exploration has wrapped up, and the vessel is on its way to Tuvalu. So far, scientists have documented diverse and healthy ecosystems, and have begun sharing their knowledge with village chiefs. At the end of the journey, they will report the full findings to government and other partners.Dr Keiron Fraser, expedition leader for Pristine Seas, said Fiji and Rotuma are home to “an awe-inspiring array of marine life”“Guided by our local partners, this team will help unlock the mysteries of the ocean so we can learn how to best protect it,” he said.The Pacific Ocean is home to many, but due to its sheer size, there are areas that are yet to be fully explored.“For many of our islands, the ocean isn’t just our back yard. It’s our lifeline. Protecting it starts with knowledge – and that starts with expeditions like this,” Erasito says.Fraser says Erasito’s involvement has been “inspiring for the young people in Rotuma”.“We’ve been unbelievably lucky to have Charlene with us. The children loved her… a real example of what’s possible.”Erasito hopes other young Pacific women will follow her path.“The ocean is in our blood, our stories, and our responsibilities. You belong – in science, on ships, in submarines, and in rooms where ocean decisions are made. Follow your heart.”",

            "title": "Toxic tofu? How plastic waste from the west fuels food factories in Indonesia",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/10/tofu-plastic-indonesia",
            "content": "Plastic waste from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, the US and Britain is being used to fuel tofu production in Indonesia, the Guardian has learned.Five factory owners in an industrial village in East Java, and one environmental organisation told the Guardian that imported plastic is burned daily to fuel furnaces in factories that produce tofu, prompting concern about serious health impacts.Each day about 60 tofu factories in Tropodo fire up their boilers and fryers and then feed them with a combination of plastic waste, wood and coconut husks, producing about 60 tonnes of tofu that is distributed in the region, including to Indonesia’s second-largest city Surabaya. The tofu is not sold outside Indonesia.“We use plastic because it is cheaper,” said one factory owner, asking to remain anonymous.The open burning of waste is banned in Indonesia but it remains a common way to dispose of waste across the archipelago.In one Tropodo factory, alongside domestic plastic waste and even discarded rubber from a nearby shoe factory sit huge piles of imported foreign plastic, among them a dog food packet from New Zealand, and cheese wrappers from France.A different factory owner, Wahyuni, said they burn through a truckload of imported plastic every two days, which costs about $13, compared with $130 for the same amount of wood. Truckloads varied in weight but could be up to three tonnes.The Guardian visited five factories and all burned imported foreign waste, although the amounts varied.Indonesians consume an average 8kg of tofu per person annually, according to the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics (BPS), but production of the protein-rich staple is causing concern among environmental groups such as Ecoton, which monitors illegal dumpsites near paper mills and tofu factories.“Non-recyclable plastic scraps are sold [as fuel] to industries such as tofu production. It is only the paper mill scrap that can provide them with a continuous and sufficient amount of cheap fuel,” said Ecoton’s Dr Daru Setyorini.“It’s very easy to find trash from rich countries [at the factories], especially the United States and Australia,” she added.Much of the foreign plastic, Setyorini said, originated from paper imports.Indonesia imports about 3m tonnes of scrap paper and cardboard annually, government data shows. According to World Bank data, the largest exporters to Indonesia are the EU, US, UK, Australia and Japan.Many of the shipments arrive at Indonesia’s largest port in Surabaya, about an hour’s drive from Tropodo, and then distributed to nearly a dozen paper mills for recycling.The Indonesian government has set a contamination limit on paper imports at 2%, but Ecoton says enforcement is weak and many of the bundles are littered with more, sometimes as high as 30%.Unwanted by the paper mills, the plastic is sold to brokers or given away. Ecoton estimates about 70 tonnes are burnt in Tropodo’s tofu factories each week.Indonesia became a hotspot for the global recycling industry after China banned waste imports in 2018. The south-east Asian nation imported 260,000 tonnes of plastic waste in 2024 alone.The government introduced a ban on plastic waste imports this year, but local activists argue it won’t address the core issue: paper waste imports contaminated with plastic scraps.The Indonesian Pulp and Paper Association, which represents more than 60 companies that import waste to Indonesia, did not respond to requests for comment.Three major paper mills that the tofu factories said supplied them with the imported plastic waste also did not respond to questions from the Guardian.Inside a sweltering tofu factory in Tropodo, the stench of burning plastic is overwhelming, but the workers seem unfazed.Asked about the health risks, one said they all smoked cigarettes anyway, “and none of us have got sick”.Traditionally, wood fuelled the boilers, but high costs have led factory owners to a shift to plastic.Factory owner Joko said that tofu factories in East Java have for years burned plastic to fuel production, a practice he said that also occurs near other major recycling facilities in Java.Joko directed the Guardian to one of the illegal plastic scrap dumpsites where the factories source their scrap plastic and where foreign plastic was found.Experts say that burning plastic, especially in food production, poses serious health risks, including an increased risk of respiratory illnesses and chronic disease.This February Ecoton tested tofu purchased from a Tropodo market and found high concentrations of microplastics, in the form of fibres, ranging from 0.15mm to 1.76mm.Scientists are still studying the impacts of microplastics on human health, but some studies indicate that they can increase the likelihood of heart attack, stroke or death.Burning plastic releases microplastic particles into the air, water and onto surfaces, increasing the risk of contamination in food products such as tofu, said Dr Setyorini.Environmental groups have also reported dangerous pollution from toxic ash accumulating around tofu factories and entering the food chain through free-range chickens.A 2024 study involving Jakarta-based research and advocacy group Nexus3 Foundation found consuming half a free-range egg from sites near tofu factories in Tropodo, Kawerang and Tangerang, West Java, would exceed safe daily dioxin levels by 48 times.The researchers noted dioxins could cause developmental problems in children, lead to reproductive and infertility problems in adults, result in miscarriages, damage the immune system and interfere with hormones.“They could spend 1.5m rupiah ($97) per week to buy wood as a safer fuel,” said Nexus3 co-founder Yuyun Ismawati, “But with plastic scraps, company trucks drop it off for free.”Another owner, speaking anonymously, said he was concerned about the health impacts, but reverting to wood would increase costs sixfold. He urged the government to subsidise factories to use cleaner fuels.Novrizal Tahar, director of waste management at Indonesia’s environment ministry, agreed the practice was “dangerous for human health” and said the government is working to enforce the import ban.To Dr Setyorini, that is only part of the problem.A bigger issue, she said, is wealthy nations exporting their waste to developing nations, a practice she described as “waste colonialism”.",

            "content": "Police are investigating an alleged attack on a prison officer at HMP Belmarsh by Southport triple killer Axel Rudakubana.On Thursday, Rudakubana, 18, allegedly used a kettle in his cell to heat water up and then poured boiling water over the officer.The prison officer was taken to hospital as a precaution and was discharged on the same day and is expected back at work next week, the Guardian understands.A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Police are investigating an attack on a prison officer at HMP Belmarsh [on Thursday]. Violence in prison will not be tolerated and we will always push for the strongest possible punishment for attacks on our hard-working staff.”Rudakubana was jailed for a minimum of 52 years in January for the murders of three girls – Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven – and attempted murders of eight other children, dance class instructor Leanne Lucas and businessman John Hayes.The attack took place at a Taylor Swift-themed workshop in Southport on 29 July 2024, and 10 others were injured. He was also convicted of offences including producing ricin, possessing terrorist material, and possessing a knife.In April, the home secretary said that an inquiry into the Southport murders had formally begun its work looking at how to learn lessons from the attack.According to data from the Ministry of Justice, assaults on staff in adult prisons in England and Wales per year has reached its highest level in a decade. About 10,605 assaults on staff in male and female jails were recorded in 2024, up from 9,204 in 2023 and over the triple the recorded amount in 2014 – which was 3640.Justice secretary Shabana Mahmood has previously announced that the use of Tasers will be trialled in prisons. She also confirmed the Prison Service will conduct a “snap review” of the use of protective body armour for prison officers.In a post on X, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Warning after warning has been ignored. I personally raised security at HMP Belmarsh just last week. “This is a full blown crisis. No more lengthy ‘reviews’ – the justice secretary needs to act NOW.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-10 00:01",
            "content": "Hundreds of leading figures and organisations in the UK’s creative industries, including Coldplay, Paul McCartney, Dua Lipa, Ian McKellen and the Royal Shakespeare Company, have urged the prime minister to protect artists’ copyright and not “give our work away” at the behest of big tech.In an open letter to Keir Starmer, a host of major artists claim creatives’ livelihoods are under threat as wrangling continues over a government plan to let artificial intelligence companies use copyright-protected work without permission.Describing copyright as the “lifeblood” of their professions, the letter warns Starmer that the proposed legal change will threaten Britain’s status as a leading creative power.“We will lose an immense growth opportunity if we give our work away at the behest of a handful of powerful overseas tech companies and with it our future income, the UK’s position as a creative powerhouse, and any hope that the technology of daily life will embody the values and laws of the United Kingdom,” the letter says.The letter urges the government to accept an amendment to the data bill proposed by Beeban Kidron, the cross-bench peer and leading campaigner against the copyright proposals. Kidron, who organised the artists’ letter, is seeking a change that requires AI firms tell copyright owners which individual works they have ingested into their models.Urging parliamentarians on all sides of the political spectrum and in both houses to support the change, the letter says: “We urge you to vote in support of the UK creative industries. Supporting us supports the creators of the future. Our work is not yours to give away.”Spanning the worlds of music, theatre, film, literature, art and media, the more than 400 signatories include Elton John, Kazuo Ishiguro, Annie Lennox, Rachel Whiteread, Jeanette Winterson, the National Theatre and the News Media Association, which represents more than 800 news titles including the Guardian.Kidron’s amendment will go to a House of Lords vote on Monday, although the government has already signalled its opposition to the change, saying that a consultation process already under way was the correct process for debating alterations to copyright law, which protects someone’s work from being used by others without permission.Under the government proposal, AI companies will be able to use copyright-protected material without permission unless the copyright holder “opts out” of the process by indicating – in an as yet unspecified way – that they do not wish their work to be used for free.Giles Martin, the music producer and son of the Beatles producer George Martin, told the Guardian the opt-out plan could be impractical for young artists.“When Paul McCartney wrote Yesterday his first thought was ‘how do I record this’ and not ‘how do I stop someone stealing this’,” said Martin, who was the music supervisor on the documentary series The Beatles: Get Back and co-produced the “last” Beatles song Now and Then.Kidron said the letter’s signatories were speaking out “to ensure a positive future for the next generation of creators and innovators”.Supporters of the Kidron amendment claim the change will ensure creatives are compensated for the use of their work in training AI models via licensing deals.Generative AI models, the term for technology that underpins powerful tools such as the ChatGPT chatbot or the Suno music-making tool, have to be trained on a vast amount of data in order to generate their responses. The main source of this information is online, including the contents of Wikipedia, YouTube, newspaper articles and online book archives.The government has submitted one amendment to the data bill that commits to officials carrying out an economic impact assessment of its proposals. A source close to Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, has told the Guardian that an opt-out system was no longer his preferred option.Officially, there are four options under consideration. The other three alongside the “opt-out” scenario are: to leave the situation unchanged; require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative companies and individuals.A government spokesperson said: “Uncertainty over how our copyright framework operates is holding back growth for our AI and creative industries. That cannot continue, but we’re clear that no changes will be considered unless we are completely satisfied they work for creators.”",

            "content": "A diver who was working on preliminary operations to raise the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch’s sunken superyacht, Bayesian, has died during underwater work in Sicily.The 39-year-old Dutch diver died on Friday while working underwater in preparation to cut the ship’s mainmast.According to initial reports, the man was employed by the maritime company Hebo, whose barge arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo, where marine salvage experts have been carrying out preparatory work before an operation to raise the 56-metre superyacht.Police said the precise cause of death was still unknown. A preliminary examination of the body revealed no visible injuries or burns. Investigators believe the diver may have suffered a medical problem while submerged.An alternative line of inquiry is that after divers used a blowtorch to cut the vessel’s boom the man was struck by dislodged debris – possibly a piece of metal. Footage captured by underwater cameras cut off shortly before the incident.A spokesperson for the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of expert salvage specialists undertaking the project, said: “We are saddened to confirm the tragic death of a specialist diver while doing underwater work earlier today [Friday]. The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the authorities and all parties are offering their full cooperation. We are giving every support to the salvage team on site at this heartbreaking time and our thoughts are with the family of the deceased.”On 19 August 2024, the luxury vessel, with a 75-metre (246ft) mast, was anchored just off shore near Porticello when it was struck shortly before dawn by a violent storm. Lynch, once described as Britain’s Bill Gates, and his 18-year-old daughter, Hannah, were among the seven victims.Lynch, who in June last year was cleared of fraud charges in the US relating to the purchase of his company, Autonomy, by Hewlett-Packard in 2011, was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicily to celebrate his acquittal alongside Hannah and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian.Among those onboard were Lynch’s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, and his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, and Morgan Stanley International’s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died.Fifteen people survived, including Bacares.Sign up to Headlines EuropeA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayafter newsletter promotionThe wreckage sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities.Insurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (£23m), a bill the Bayesian’s underwriters will pick up.The Italian coastguard, which is supervising operations and patrolling the security perimeter, said the overall operation to recover the Bayesian could take from 20 to 25 days, weather permitting.",

Just like this next newsletter, dear readers. It’s got your weekend reads sorted with trips, tips and talent.EA Hanks grew up with a very famous father – “not just the Hollywood Everyman, but America’s Dad,” Emine Saner writes, after speaking with the daughter of Tom Hanks about her upcoming memoir. The author has explored the Hollywood side of her childhood, but what she’s really trying to make sense of is her late mother’s life.‘A lifetime spent on very thin ice’: One half of Hanks’ early life was spent with her mother, Susan, suffering with addiction and mental health problems, which contributed to an abusive relationship.The other half: EA spent with her father, Tom, on film sets and in a house full of love and structure.She tells Saner about her road trip back into her complicated past – recreating a fraught 1996 journey with Susan nearly 20 years after her death.How long will it take to read: Six minutes.

Prost’s images don’t venture inside. They do, however, capture the “dazzlingly imaginative” range of visions.Traditional teahouses to themed palaces: Dating as far back as the 1600s, “lovers’ teahouses” were traditionally discreet from the outside – then, as Wainwright explains, a postwar economic boom saw them “blossom into elaborate sexual amusement parks in the 1970s and 80s, with themes ranging from fairytale to sci-fi to medieval cosplay”.For babymaking? Yep, Wainwright reckons a good chunk of the country’s population could’ve been “conceived on a rotating bed, or inside a fantastical tropical grotto surrounded by model dinosaurs”.How long will it take to read: Three minutes.Further reading: Speaking of dinosaurs … check out Australia’s best small museums: celebrating apples, bottles, country music, and – yes – dinosaurs.Sophie Payten has been living a double life. “In one, she is Gordi, the Aria-nominated singer-songwriter who has worked with Bon Iver and Troye Sivan, and made Chris Martin cry,” writes Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen.

Like its manosphere counterpart (a section of the internet promoting masculinity, misogyny … and the awful list goes on), this online corner is all about pushing anti-feminist ideas on to young women. So, what does it have to do with Blake Lively?Remember Johnny Depp v Amber Heard? Blake Lively’s situation is a new level ugly, says Steve Rose, who has looked into how conservative personalities such as Candace Owens and the American right declared war on the actor after she sued her director, co-star and co-producer Justin Baldoni, and he sued her back.Candace Owens’ view: “She has proven herself not to be a kind person,” the US commentator said in January. “And that’s largely due to the fact that she is a modern feminist.”How long will it take to read: Five and a half minutes.More tabs to open: Anna Silman’s “womanosphere” deep dive, and Van Badham on the question of whether the “womanosphere” will succeed.“Self-checkouts, drive-throughs, hotdog stands, drug stores, and a bottled water stall at a jazz festival” are all places where Americans have told the Guardian they are being asked to tip, Jem Bartholomew writes. “Before, tipping was considered generosity,” Garrett Petters, a 29-year-old architect in Dallas, says. “Now, it’s about guilt.”Is US tipping culture here to stay? For some consumers, it’s the least they can do for workers during tough times. But others are pushing back.A 33-year-old from Massachusetts: Ellen has been avoiding the “suggested tip” starting at 25%, and instead selects “the lowest option, or not tipping at all for workers covered by regular minimum wage laws”.A 62-year-old from Florida: Sandra has increased her tip percentage “from 15% to 20% or 25% recently” for her local workers who have suffered through Covid, and three major storms.How long will it take to read: Three minutes.Enjoying the Five Great Reads email?

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 23:00",
            "content": "The former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has launched a blistering attack on Israel, accusing its government of committing genocide in Gaza and “carrying out the largest ethnic-cleansing operation since the end of the second world war in order to create a splendid holiday destination”.Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister who served as the EU’s top diplomat from 2019 to 2024, and president of the European parliament from 2004 to 2007, also criticised the bloc’s failure to use all the means at its disposal to influence Israel, saying expressions of regret were simply not enough.As he collected the Charles V European award in front of dignitaries including King Felipe in south-west Spain on Friday, Borrell said the horrors Israel had suffered in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 could not justify the horrors it had subsequently inflicted on Gaza.“We’re facing the largest ethnic cleansing operation since the end of the second world war in order to create a splendid holiday destination once all the millions of tonnes of rubble have been cleared from Gaza and the Palestinians have died or gone away,” he said in a characteristically direct speech.​The former diplomat accused Israel of violating all the rules of conflict and of using the starvation of Gaza’s civilian population as a “weapon of war”.“Three times more explosive power has been dropped on Gaza than was used in the Hiroshima bomb,” he said. “And for months now, nothing has been getting into Gaza. Nothing: no water, no food, no electricity, no fuel, no medical services. That’s what [Benjamin] Netanyau’s ministers have said and it’s what they’ve done.”He added: “We all know what’s going on there, and we’ve all heard the objectives stated by Netanyau’s ministers​, which are clear declarations of genocidal intent. Seldom have I heard the leader of a state so clearly outline a plan that fits the legal definition of genocide.”Borrell went on to take Europe to task for shirking its moral and humanitarian responsibilities over Gaza.“Europe has the capacity and the means not only to protest against what is going on but also to influence [Israel’s] conduct,” he said. “But it is not doing so. We supply half the bombs that are falling on Gaza. If we really believe that too many people are dying, then the natural response would be to supply fewer weapons and to use the lever of the association agreement to demand that international humanitarian law is respected, instead of just lamenting that that isn’t happening.”The veteran socialist politician also used his speech to reflect on current geopolitical realities, which he described as unprecedented. The post-1945 world order, he said, was being demolished by Vladimir Putin, “a tyrant whose military failure in Ukraine has made him more dangerous”, and by Donald Trump who he described as “the master of chaos, who has gone from being an ally to an adversary”.The question facing Europe, he added, was how well it would cope without the protections long afforded by its old ally across the Atlantic.Sign up to This is EuropeThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentafter newsletter promotion“In order to deal with this situation, we need to move from structural pacifism to strong rearmament, but we need to do that on a European scale if we want to avoid the waste that stirs the old national demons,” said Borrell. “We need to shift away from a comfortable and atavistic Atlanticism, which has seen us delegate our security to the US, to building full European sovereignty, which will also mean giving Europe a fiscal and security dimension.”He said that Europe was no longer the great driver, or chronicler, of world history.“Today, history has become a product that’s imported,” Borrell added. “History has been written by the Russian soldiers who marched towards Kyiv in the early hours of a February morning, and by the Ukrainians who resisted. History is being written by the US voters who put Mr Trump back in the White House.”History, he went on, was now the story of the technological competition between the US and China. In what appeared to be a swipe at Trump, Borrell added: “The faces of history today are those of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. None of them is European. I know them – well, I know them a bit – and I can assure you that of those three, two are more intelligent than the third. The thing is the third one doesn’t know it.”",

            "content": "The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland are due in Kyiv on Saturday for a symbolic visit to Ukraine, a day after Vladimir Putin hosted a set-piece military parade on Red Square. The visit comes as the US warned of intelligence about a big impending air attack on Ukraine.Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk are expected to arrive in Kyiv early on Saturday and will meet the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a show of support for Ukraine, Downing Street said in a statement issued late on Friday.“We, the leaders of France, Germany, Poland the United Kingdom will stand in Kyiv in solidarity with Ukraine against Russia’s barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion,” the four leaders said in a joint statement.The four European leaders will reiterate calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the conflict during their visit, something that Donald Trump and the US administration have said could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement but Russia has so far refused.Instead, Moscow unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday. Fighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.However, as the leaders were already en route to Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv put out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a “potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days”. It did not give further details.The four European leaders are expected to visit Kyiv’s Maidan on Saturday morning, where thousands of flags have been planted to remember those who have been killed in the war with Russia, before sitting down with Zelenskyy. Later, Downing Street said the five would beam into a virtual meeting to update other leaders on progress being made for a so-called “air, land, maritime and regeneration force” that is planned to be part of a peace deal.“We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal,” said the statement.“We will continue to increase our support for Ukraine. Until Russia agrees to an enduring ceasefire, we will ratchet up pressure on Russia’s war machine.”Sign up to This is EuropeThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentafter newsletter promotionOn Friday, thousands of troops marched through Red Square as Putin held his annual Victory Day parade. Numerous world leaders attended, most notably China’s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vučić, prime minister of EU member Slovakia and president of EU hopeful Serbia respectively, also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders.“All those who truly support peace cannot stand side-by-side with Putin. Those who truly support peace should be in Ukraine tomorrow, not Moscow,” said the EU’s top diplomat on Thursday. Foreign ministers from numerous EU countries, as well as Britain’s David Lammy, travelled to Lviv on Friday, to announce the foundation of a tribunal for Russian war crimes in Ukraine.Saturday’s visit to Kyiv is likely to focus more on finding a common western position on Ukraine to take to Donald Trump, as European leaders try their best to keep the US onside. The Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the Pope’s funeral.Even vice-president JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine, has criticised Moscow’s stance in recent days. “Right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,” he said on Wednesday.",

            "content": "Arne Slot has insisted Liverpool will “generate new stars” when Trent Alexander-Arnold leaves and compared the right-back’s potential successor, Conor Bradley, to Paris Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi.Slot admits Alexander-Arnold’s decision to leave as a free agent this summer has come as a major disappointment. But he urged fans to focus their energies on the team that faces Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday and as “less as possible to Trent, unless it’s positive.” Slot confirmed Bradley will start the game as he plans for life without the Real Madrid-bound defender.Alexander-Arnold’s desire for a fresh challenge in the wake of winning the Premier League title deepened Slot’s sense of regret. But the head coach is adamant that Liverpool will handle their latest succession convincingly. “It is a disappointment for the fans, for teammates and for me that he is leaving,” he said. “We are going to miss a very good human being and a very, very, very good full-back.“We tried to keep him here. If that does not work out, of course you are disappointed. There were a lot of questions about me replacing Jürgen [Klopp] and there are so many examples of people leaving this club. Kevin Keegan left, Kenny Dalglish arrived. We all felt disappointed, we felt sad, but we always know this club will generate new stars again.”“Trent is not the first and won’t be the last one to leave a special club,” Slot added. “Players from [Manchester] City, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool sometimes go somewhere else. What is important for me is that it was really hard for him to leave this club. We as a club did everything we could to keep him here and then we have to accept his decision.”Slot would not be drawn on whether Liverpool will attempt to replace Alexander-Arnold via the transfer market this summer. Bayer Leverkusen’s Jeremie Frimpong, who has a release clause of €35m (£29.6m), will be of interest should the club decide to buy. Bradley is the leading internal candidate to take over. The Liverpool head coach paid the 21-year-old Northern Ireland international a huge compliment by comparing him to Morocco captain Hakimi, one of the finest full-backs in the world.“Conor has such an intense playing style,” said Slot. “They all run a lot but Conor is in his own league when it comes to running a lot, comparable maybe with Achraf Hakimi at PSG. He is everywhere during the game. But Hakimi is 26.

He is not the only one who has not been a regular starter who has had some injuries this season, look at Diogo Jota and Harvey Elliott. The ones who are not regular starters, it is harder to keep them fit than the ones who are. If Conor is going to be the regular starter next season that could maybe help him. I think he had 20 games [in a row] last season when Trent was injured. Let’s hope that has a positive impact on his fitness as well.”",

            "content": "Pep Guardiola has described this season as the “most difficult” of his 17-year managerial career. Manchester City sit third with three Premier League matches remaining and play in the FA Cup final next Saturday but have struggled to match the form that brought them four Premier League titles in a row, at one point winning one game in 13.Victory at the bottom club, Southampton, on Saturday would put City level with second-placed Arsenal, who visit the champions, Liverpool, on Sunday, as Guardiola inches closer salvaging the season with Champions League qualification.“It’s been the most difficult [season], that’s for sure,” Guardiola said. “It’s been more demanding. Much more. When you don’t win it’s more demanding emotionally and preparing, and the moods and everything. It’s been more difficult than the previous seasons we played for the titles.“We didn’t win one game for many months, we were unable to win a lot of games. It’s demanding, but we don’t win. It’s a business: you have to win games. Otherwise, you cannot be here next time. We represent the people, represent the club, so you have to do your job as best as possible. And today, this season, we didn’t do that. So we were in the highest standards and we dropped it. Even with that, I would say it could be worse.”Guardiola will be able to call upon Erling Haaland from the start at St Mary’s Stadium after the striker recovered from an ankle problem, as City seek to continue their best league run since the start of the season, having won four matches in a row. The Norwegian was an unused substitute in the win over Wolves last Friday and, having not played since March, could get some minutes in preparation for facing Crystal Palace at Wembley. In an interview with ESPN this week, Haaland said he did not think the team had enough “hunger” this season.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotion“If this is the feeling from Erling, the players should talk to each other and ask themselves: ‘Why?’” Guardiola said.",

            "content": "For Mikel Arteta, there has been no time to dwell on the pain. “Not now,” said the Arsenal manager when asked if he was emotionally exhausted after a week when his team were eliminated from the Champions League. “Probably because I have so much to achieve and do, and we need to improve and get done. That is what drives me every day,” he said. “But if there is somebody that has raised the standard and the expectation the highest, it has been me. Because I have been demanding and expecting much more, and after that much more.“For me it is the only way to do it, for everybody to have really high standards and demands. We are very, very close to achieving it. I understand the disappointment, and the criticism. It is all part of it. At the end there is one winner and the rest of them aren’t going to win, so they need to reinvent themselves and do better. That is part of the cycle.”It is a cycle that Arteta is having to get used to. After finishing as Premier League runners-up in the past two seasons to Manchester City, watching his players giving champions Liverpool a guard of honour at Anfield on Sunday will not be easy for the former Everton midfielder. Even if there was no rowing back from the conviction that his side had been superior to Paris Saint-Germain over both legs of their semi-final, Arteta was honest to admit that his side have taken “a step backwards” in the league this year.With qualification still not assured for next season’s Champions League, Arsenal need to win their final three matches to reach 76 points – 13 points fewer than they managed last season and eight fewer than in the campaign before that. There is even a chance that Arsenal could end up with less than the 69 points they managed in 2022, when they finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League.“If it doesn’t hurt then it means you don’t love winning as much as I do,” said Arteta , going on to stress that extenuating circumstances have made it harder for Arsenal to match their previous two domestic points tallies: “You need to understand as well certain things that happened – it was impossible to try to aim to get the same kind of points. With the league there has been two main reasons: one is the amount of games and time that we have played with 10 men, and then the availability of the squad throughout the 38 games. It’s very, very difficult to manage and to have very strong performance consistently. We dropped a lot of points, we dropped a lot of points when we were ahead as well which is something that really needs to improve.”Alongside injuries and ill-discipline, the elephant in the room is Arsenal’s requirement to sign a new striker in the summer. Arteta bristled when it was suggested that he hadn’t made it clear he had wanted to bring in attacking reinforcements in January after Gabriel Jesus was ruled out for the remainder of the campaign due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, and one of the most important tasks facing the club’s new sporting director, Andrea Berta, will be deliver a top-class alternative. Sporting’s Viktor Gyökeres remains a more realistic target than Newcastle’s Alexander Isak, while Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig – who Arteta must surely regret not being able to sign last summer – is another option.The fact Kai Havertz remains Arsenal’s top scorer in the Premier League with nine goals despite not having played since January is an illustration of where they have fallen short. Arteta pointed to the fact that his side scored more than 90 goals last season, which would usually mean “you have a high, high probability of winning the Premier League”. But their tally of 64 this season is less than Liverpool, City and Newcastle have managed, and there has been a clear over-reliance on set pieces, a source of goals which pretty much dried up after the turn of the year.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionAnother player with the creative ability to unlock defences is also required, in part to ease the burden on an underperforming Martin Ødegaard. Arsenal have looked at Nico Williams of Athletic Bilbao and Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze. Resolving the future of Jesus, who is one of the club’s highest earners but went nine months without scoring a league goal before hitting a purple patch that was ultimately cut short by injury, is another priority for Berta.“Very much,” said Arteta when asked if he is looking forward to what the future has in store. “Already with the players that we have and having everybody fit and available, we are a super-strong team. What we’ve done in the Champions League semi-final we haven’t done in 20 years in this football club. Very, very positive about it.”Not since Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal side in 2001 has a team finished as runners-up in the Premier League three seasons in a row – and they went on to win the Double the following season and formed the foundation of Wenger’s Invincibles in 2004. Arteta is hoping that this generation of Arsenal players can also use the disappointment of coming so close to finally achieve their dreams.“I know how much they [the players] are still hurting – now we have to show the fight and how much we care about what is happening,” said the Spaniard. “And what we still have to achieve, which is a big thing because we haven’t done it yet. The mindset is going to be there and now we have got to prove that we can do it.”",

            "content": "One of the most important attributes for a top tennis player to have is a bad memory. In such an intense sport where another significant event is always around the corner, being consistent means not dwelling on successes or failures, always focusing on the next task.Five days after finishing as runner-up at the Madrid Open, this was the challenge before Jack Draper in Rome. He handled his opening match extremely well, holding off a spirited comeback from Italy’s Luciano Darderi in an intense two-set tussle to reach the third round of the Italian Open with a 6-1, 6-4 win.Fresh off one of the best tournaments of his career, Draper picked up where he left off early on, serving supremely and lasering forehand winners as he breezed through the opening set. Things became much more difficult in the increasingly cool and slow evening clay-court conditions. Buoyed by a hopeful home crowd, Darderi dragged his opponent into lengthy, physical rallies and dominated the baseline points during the set.Draper faced six break points during the second set, including four in a dramatic game at 3-3, but every time it hung in the balance, he scuppered the danger by producing a massive first serve and playing bold attacking tennis to escape. In his first week as a top-five player, this was a mental performance befitting of one of the elite and it earned him a third-round match with Vit Kopriva of the Czech Republic.“There were a couple [of points] there at 30-30 where I went after the forehand, but I missed it,” Draper said. “And then on the break point, I didn’t go into my shell, I kept on trying to come forward, kept on trying to do the right things and that’s what I see from top players. They back themselves on every point, regardless of whether it’s a break point or not. And I think those kind of pressure moments, that’s what separates great players from good players.“So I’m still trying to learn how to be effective in those moments. But I think mentally and emotionally, I’m definitely dealing with that much better. And I think that’s experience at this level and just belief in what I’m doing.”Earlier on Friday, Emma Raducanu maintained her composure despite only learning of her second-round opponent at the 11th hour, eventually producing one of her cleanest performances of the season to reach the third round with a 6-2, 6-2 win against the Swiss lucky loser Jil Teichmann.A couple of days after her turbulent, tension-filled first-round win over the teenage Australian Maya Joint, in which she failed to serve out the match in set two before regrouping well to close out the final set, Raducanu found herself back on the same court under completely different circumstances. The Briton had been scheduled to face Ekaterina Alexandrova, the 21st seed, until around three hours before the match when it emerged that she had withdrawn. She was replaced by Teichmann, a Swiss player ranked No 94, who had lost in the final qualifying round.Not only does Teichmann, a lefty with a topspin-heavy forehand, play a completely different style to the flat-hitting, ultra-aggressive Alexandrova, Raducanu and Teichmann had also never faced each other. Still, this was a great opportunity for Raducanu against a lower-ranked opponent.Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionafter newsletter promotion“It was difficult,” Raducanu said. “I found out literally mid-practice and it was a big change. I mean, completely different opponents. Ekaterina plays very fast and flat, and is a right-hander. And then playing Jill, she’s lefty, plays a lot more spin, a lot more variation. So it was hard. I haven’t really hit with a lefty for since my match with Marketa [Vondrousova] in Abu Dhabi. So adjusting was difficult, but I’m really pleased with the way that I was able to.”Before the tournament, Raducanu said she planned to find her way on clay by committing to attacking tennis. She has backed up those intentions in the heat of battle this week, producing an impressive display of smart, offensive tennis and particularly striking her forehand brilliantly. On Sunday, she will face Veronika Kudermetova, a former No 9, for a spot in round four.Elsewhere, Cameron Norrie, who had entered the main draw as a lucky loser, fell 6-4, 6-2 to the 10th seed Daniil Medvedev and Sonay Kartal was also defeated 6-4, 6-2 by the 30th seed Linda Noskova.",

            "content": "Who ever believed the form book counted for much in the playoffs anyway? No team has ever entered the English playoffs in worse form than Sunderland, after their five successive defeats, but goals from Wilson Isidor, his first in 14 games, and Eliezer Mayenda, after a disastrous back-pass from Milan van Ewijk, enabled Sunderland to earn their first victory over Coventry since 2007 and become favourites to reach the Wembley final against either Sheffield United or Bristol City on 24 May.Jack Rudoni, who grew up a Chelsea fan, Frank Lampard his hero, had headed Coventry level within two minutes of Isidor breaking his long goal drought. But then, in the 88th minute, Mayenda was gifted a clear run on goal by Van Ewijk’s nightmare of a blind pass back towards his goalkeeper Ben Wilson. The Spanish striker rounded the Sunderland academy graduate in Coventry’s net and scored the goal that has turned expectations on their head. The 2,400 travelling Sunderland fans reprised the Roker roar in their small corner of the CBS Arena.Lampard lifted Coventry from just above the relegation zone to fifth place after taking over in November and is certainly not discounting the possibility of reaching Wembley from this disadvantaged position. He took Derby to the 2019 Championship playoff final after recovering from two goals behind to Leeds. “It’s half-time,” the manager said. “This was never going to be over [after one game] and it’s not over, that’s for sure. And Sunderland will know it’s not over. We know it’s not over. I won’t be drawing on too much from the past. We just look at what this [second] game might look like, and we don’t know, because they may take the same [defensive] approach at home that they brought here. Will they want to play so low at home, or will the crowd drag them out. They sucked us in [tonight] and hit us on the break.”This, however, after a mediocre run of 14 points from 14 games, was Sunderland’s night. They won with 26% possession and two fine finishes from their front pairing.Régis Le Bris’s team have for so long been effectively guaranteed fourth place, with Leeds, Burnley and Sheffield United battling it out for the two automatic promotion places, that they had taken their foot off the gas. The Sunderland head coach conceded as much after this breakaway victory.“Today we felt like we were playing with a plan, after the five previous games, with all our players [but two] fit and fresh. We did so well to get fourth place but then players are players and if you don’t have something to chase … today they showed they had a purpose.”Coventry fans have endured bitter experiences in the past two seasons, losing in penalty shootouts in both the Championship playoff final, to Luton, two years ago, and the FA Cup semi-final, to Manchester United last year, under Mark Robins, but their vociferous sell-out crowd had Sunderland quaking in the first period.Everything appeared in Coventry’s favour. They had been in decent form, winning nine of their previous 11 home games, and stretched their unbeaten run against Sunderland to 10 games when Haji Wright scored a hat-trick in the win here in March.From the right wing, Tatsuhiro Sakamoto was constantly causing Sunderland problems, not least after Dennis Cirkin was booked for a fairly crude foul midway through the half. He seemed able to cut inside and swerve over his inswinging crosses at will, and more than once Anthony Patterson flapped at crosses. But they did not have any clearcut chances.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionIn their third playoff in four seasons, Sunderland came back into this contest after the interval. A corner routine had ended with Enzo Le Fée delivering a fine diagonal cross for Trai Hume, the original taker, to volley hard but wide.Although Rudoni, the jewel in Coventry’s crown, snapped a shot wide, there was a sense of unease infiltrating the home ranks. Three Coventry players were cautioned in eight minutes. Sure enough, Sunderland went ahead midway through the second half. Le Fée picked up the ball in the centre circle and this time the two forwards split their runs. Isidor was picked out superbly, as Coventry appealed in vain for offside, and the Frenchman cut inside to fire his shot into the far bottom corner for his 13th goal of the season.This served to wake Coventry up. Within two minutes Van Ewijk crossed from the right wing and Rudoni – who else? – rose at the near post to head powerfully home, his 12th goal involvement in his last 13 games. But Mayenda, who turned 20 on the eve of the game, had more cause for celebration as he scored the winner of this first leg.",

As a junior officer he saw service around the world, after qualifying as helicopter aircrew and a principal warfare officer.He was made vice admiral in February 2016, before becoming the Royal Navy’s fleet commander and later chief of joint operations until he was appointed first sea lord in 2021.Over his career, he has commanded four ships: the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious.An Iraq war veteran, prior to taking over the Navy Key was also awarded a US bronze star and oversaw the retreat from Afghanistan.In his current role, he is also chief of the naval staff and chair of the navy board, where he is responsible to the secretary of state for the fighting “effectiveness, efficiency and morale” of the service.Key last year issued an unreserved apology for “intolerable” misogyny in the Submarine Service, after a series of investigations across the navy exposed sexual harassment, bullying and assault of women within its ranks.The navy chief said he was “truly sorry” to the women who had suffered “misogyny, bullying and other unacceptable behaviours” while serving their country. “We must be better than this and do better than we have,” he said.The MoD said on Friday: “An investigation is ongoing and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.”",

            "content": "Giving weight loss jabs to everyone eligible for them could boost the UK economy by £4.5bn, according to research.Worldwide, about 3.8 billion people over 25 and just under 750 million children and young people are forecast to be overweight or obese by 2050. In England, 26.5% of adults are obese, while across the UK 4.6 million are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.Obesity and type 2 diabetes are estimated to cost the UK £100bn a year. While semaglutide, better known as Wegovy and Ozempic, has been linked to a reduced risk of 42 conditions, the impact on quality of life and productivity has until now been less understood.A new study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Málaga, Spain, examined data from 2,660 participants in three semaglutide clinical trials in the UK who were living with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. They found that taking semaglutide enabled them to each work five extra days and carry out 12 days of unpaid work such as volunteering or childcare, as well as reducing their consumption.The authors valued these productivity gains – the annual “net production value” – at an average of £1,127 per person.That equates to £4.31bn in potential annual net productivity gains for everyone living with severe obesity and £200m for those with type 2 diabetes, who would be eligible for semaglutide on the NHS – about 4 million people. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend semaglutide for patients with a BMI of at least 35 and one weight-related condition.Robert King, a senior health economist at the consultancy Lane Clark & Peacock and co-author of the research, said the study showed there was a wider societal impact of weight loss jabs that needed to be taken into account.“Even if you are getting a relatively small [productivity] gain per person, it really does stack up to large impact at the population level. So treating these chronic diseases at scale, prioritising them for treatment is really important.”Naveed Sattar, a professor of cardiometabolic medicine and honorary consultant at the University of Glasgow, said that while the potential cost benefits for society from weight loss medication extended well beyond medical outcomes, the relative high cost of the drugs “means that the total costs for the medicines is still considerably greater than the likely total health and societal gains.“This means for now, countries cannot afford to treat all those who stand to benefit, but rather must restrict use to those with highest needs and where costs are most likely to be recovered from health gains.”Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said: “These drugs could have colossal clout in our fight to tackle obesity and in turn get unemployed Britons back to work, and we will carefully consider the results of this important research.”Weight loss jabs also show potential for treating addiction. A separate study presented at the Málaga congress found that patients taking liraglutide or semaglutide for weight loss “effortlessly” cut their alcohol consumption by almost two-thirds in four months.Researchers in Ireland and Saudi Arabia collected data on the alcohol intake of 262 overweight adults who were prescribed the medication, of whom 188 were followed up for an average of four months. They were categorised as non-drinkers, those consuming less than 10 units a week, and regular drinkers, who consumed more than 10 units.The study found that patients’ typical alcohol intake decreased from 11.3 to 4.3 units a week. For regular drinkers, the effect was even larger, from 23.2 to 7.8 units.Prof Carel le Roux, of University College Dublin and the lead author of the study, said: “The exact mechanism of how GLP-1 analogues reduce alcohol intake is still being investigated but it is thought to involve curbing cravings for alcohol that arise in subcortical areas of the brain that are not under conscious control. Thus, patients report the effects are ‘effortless’.”The effect was slightly greater than that in patients prescribed nalmefene to treat alcohol use disorder in Europe.Dr Stephen Burgess, the group leader at the University of Cambridge’s Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, said that while the study was observational, the findings were “exciting”.He added: “These drugs are generally safe and well-tolerated, and currently there are few effective treatments for alcohol addiction, so this is an exciting possibility for reducing harm in heavy drinkers.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “There is clearly a lot of potential for weight loss drugs – which are still very new medications – to have wide-ranging benefits for patients, so it’s good to see research being undertaken to explore these.“However, it’s also important that medical interventions aren’t seen as a silver bullet for either weight loss or to suppress cravings for alcohol. As with any medication, they do not come without risk and can cause side-effects which range in seriousness.”",

            "content": "After months of legal battles, Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, will finally get a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles court next week, giving the brothers a new chance at freedom.LA county superior court judge Michael Jesic ruled on Friday that the resentencing hearing can take place, starting next Tuesday.Friday’s hearing included a loss and an implicit win for Los Angeles’ new tough-on-crime prosecutor, Nathan Hochman. Defense attorneys ultimately withdrew their motion to remove Hochman’s prosecutors from the case, which the hearing was meant to discuss, but Jesic, the judge, also rejected Hochman’s efforts to withdraw the resentencing petition.The brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for fatally shooting their entertainment executive father, José Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez. The brothers were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings. Defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, while prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.The former LA county district attorney, George Gascón, had opened the door to possible freedom for the brothers in October by requesting their sentences be reduced to 50 years with the possibility of parole. His office said the case would have been handled differently today due to modern understandings of sexual abuse and trauma, and that the brothers had been rehabilitated during their 30 years in prison. Many of the Menendez brothers’ family members support their release.But Hochman, the current district attorney, has reversed course and opposes the brothers’ resentencing. Hochman has said the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes because they have not admitted to lies told during their trials. The Menendez family and lawyers have been heavily critical of the way Hochman has handled the case.On Friday, Hochman tried to again ask the court to withdraw the resentencing petition saying new evidence supports that.But Jesic disagreed and set 13 and 14 May for the resentencing hearings.“I don’t see anything new,” he said.On Friday, attorneys for the Menendez brothers also withdrew their attempt to have Hochman’s office removed from the case over allegations of conflicts of interest, ABC7 News and the Los Angeles Times reported.Asked about the attempt to remove Hochman, an attorney for the Menendez brothers said on his way into the courthouse on Friday that “I’m not so sure I want that any more,” ABC7 News reported.Attorney Mark Geragos said he planned to lodge his complaints against Hochman at a future date.California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, had filed a motion this week siding with Hochman, saying the defense had not adequately demonstrated a conflict of interest.Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said these types of recusal requests are “almost never” granted.“Defendants don’t usually get to pick their prosecutors,” she said. “Occasionally an individual prosecutor will be recused, but to recuse an entire office is very rare.”Generally, this only happens if a prosecutor’s personal family member is involved or if the district attorney’s office received outside payment in a case, Levenson said.Hochman’s office had filed a motion to oppose his removal from the case, dismissing the defense’s concerns as simply “not being happy” with prosecutors’ opinion on resentencing.“Disagreeing with the opposing side’s position is not a conflict of interest, it is simply a disagreement,” it said.The Menendez brothers are still waiting for the full results of a state parole board risk assessment ordered by the California governor’s office. The final hearing, scheduled for 13 June, will influence whether Newsom grants the brothers clemency.",

            "content": "Actors Channing Tatum and Pedro Pascal have written poems for a new anthology curated by Canadian musician and poet Mustafa that also includes contributions by the writers George Saunders, Max Porter and Hanif Abdurraqib.The book, titled Nour, explores themes of ceremony, loss and worship. “You told me God wasn’t real/ as we sat in the water in the dark that night/ I couldn’t see your eyes but I could feel the anger/ in the water”, opens Tatum’s poem, extracted below along with Pascal’s.Mustafa’s debut album, Dunya, was released last September; long before that, he’d begun collecting songwriting credits for the likes of Camila Cabello’s She Loves Control, The Weeknd’s Attention, and Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes’ Monster.His work has often focused on the impact of gang violence and the deaths of friends, drawing on his experiences growing up in the Regent Park neighbourhood of Toronto, Canada’s first social housing project. He has not returned to Regent Park since his brother was killed in 2023, he told an audience at a launch event for Nour with actor Daniel Kaluuya on Thursday evening.“In my mind I want to talk about my brother,” he told George Saunders in a discussion with the author, a transcript of which is included in Nour. “But is that my responsibility? But he was killed, I want to reimagine his memory. I want to write beauty where there wasn’t. But then I also don’t want to misconstrue the reality of the harshness of what it was”.Mustafa told Saunders that he finds himself reading pages of the writer’s Booker prize-winning novel Lincoln in the Bardo to “kids in the hood … because you’ve developed your own language, and your own universe, it’s like it’s a universe that we all have access to and we all have equal right to enter.”Nour “is the most important thing I’ve ever been a part of”, Mustafa told attenders at the launch event. The book also features work by the poet Noor Hindi and the musicians Daniel Caesar and Dev Hynes among others.“With art, we all have to surrender, especially when it comes to poetry”, said Mustafa. “You can’t just put different literary devices together and hope for beauty. There is this invisible thread that ties great work together”.You told me God wasn’t real \n as we sat in the water in the dark that night\n I couldn’t see your eyes but I could feel the anger \n in the water. You said if there was and that god \n could let a child be violated it was not a god \n worth worship. Many other things were said \n on many nights in that angry water\n Mostly talk of power soaked in booze and fearSo it’s safe to say I’ve never known religion\n I still hear your voice say “Worshipping anything \n is for fools” over the dull sound of the football on TV\n I always imagine clowns on bikes with baskets on the front\n Honking and riding in circlesBut my great secret is that I have always felt you\n Felt angels. Felt love. \n Felt the magic of so deeply caring for another\n I never knew what exactly to call it. \n Now as I write this maybe that’s what worship has been for meI’ve heard it said, god is love. Maybe my way to worship \n is to love. Every person I meet. As reckless or stupid \n as that can be. But I also worship \n my bedsheets, my favorite pillow. I worship the feeling \n right before I drink coffee, the smell of breakfast\n I have loved so much as I have drifted through this life.\n Loved so hard I almost loved myself \n right out of this world because it was all too much\n But now I surrender at the feet of each day \n that I get to experience beauty, the warmth of love\n Sun on my skinI have never known religion but I’ve always \n known you. My love. Love. Love. \n I will always worship love. I surrender \n my love always. I surrender my love forever.I see you\n late bloomer\n smoking just after sunrise for the first time. \n Wearing pants and buying pillows\n dropping cash\n then leaving them lonely in a stranger’s closet. \n Mushroom lamp says “What the fuck? Lemme outta here.”\n I explain to her that first I have to go back \n and back and back again\n until I understand that I will always be in love with those footprints. \n “Fine.”\n People smoke here\n because they like me. See me sitting near the bird shit, making things up that never happened. \n But they’re cool with it.\n Someone tells me she was kidnapped by a man who held a knife to her neck\n because her sister always picks the wrong men. \n I tell her I was a very late bed wetter. \n All the other talk happens alone,\n never into a mirror and never to you.\n But to objects caught off guard by my hostility,\n by the shape of this grief. \n Eleven months and only this: \n I am struck by the lightning of your presence \n now that you are gone.Nour can be downloaded for free through WeTransfer.",

            "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screening, its maker Teal Health said on Friday, offering an alternative to smear tests that need to be undertaken at a doctor’s office.Pap smear tests have significantly reduced cancer incidence from when they were first introduced 80 years ago. But they can be uncomfortable and inconvenient owing to the requirement for an in-clinic exam.Teal Health said the FDA’s decision was based on a study in more than 600 women that showed self-collected samples using its test had the same performance as clinician-collected samples.The approval is “not just about an innovative new product, it’s about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives, something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home”, said Teal’s co-founder and chief executive, Kara Egan.Each year in the US, about 11,500 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The startup company’s test, Teal Wand, detects human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for nearly all cervical cancers, similar to Roche’s cobas HPV test. But Teal Wand allows women to collect samples from home and send it to a certified lab for testing, while Roche’s test is approved for use in the clinic.Teal Health did not disclose the test’s price, but said it was working with major insurance providers for coverage and flexible payment options.Egan pointed to another at-home test called Cologuard, made by Exact Sciences, to detect colon cancer.“Cologuard [is] fully covered by most insurance, but also, if you have to pay out pocket, it’s around $600. We plan to be less than that,” she told Reuters.Teal Health plans to begin rolling out the kits in June for patients aged 25 to 65.",

            "content": "A former model has told a New York court that the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16, calling it the most “horrifying thing I ever experienced”.Kaja Sokola told jurors at Weinstein’s retrial that he put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at his Manhattan apartment in 2002 when she was 16.Sokola testified that Weinstein had told her that actors had to be comfortable disrobing in the film business and directed her to undress, “so I should get used to it”.She testified that she took off her blouse and followed him into a bathroom because, she said, “I was 16 years old, and I was alone with a man for the first time, and I didn’t know what else to do.“I was scared. I was scared of him,” she said. “I’d never been in an intimate situation with another person like that.”Sokola described Weinstein’s eyes as appearing “black and scary” during the alleged assault and that he had afterwards told her to keep quiet, boasting he had made Hollywood careers and could help her acting dreams come true.Sokola, the second accuser to testify at the trial in Manhattan, said from the stand that four years later – in 2006 – the defendant lured her into a hotel room and forcibly performed oral sex on her.The Polish model said Weinstein invited her to see some movie scripts but instead pushed her on to a bed. “I kept saying: ‘Please don’t, please stop, I don’t want this,’” she told jurors. “But he didn’t listen.”Sokola testified that Weinstein, 73, pinned her to the bed with his body and removed her shoes, underwear and stockings. He then allegedly forced his mouth on to her vagina while he masturbated.“My soul was removed from me,” Sokola said. “It felt like I was dead.” At the end of the approximately 15-minute encounter, Weinstein allegedly said: “You see, that wasn’t so difficult.”Sokola’s 2006 alleged encounter forms a new accusation in Weinstein’s criminal retrial and the only alleged crime not included in his original trial in 2020 that was later thrown out by an appeals court on grounds that prosecutors had used “Molineux” witnesses, or testimony not related to the crimes as charged. .Weinstein’s lawyers sought to raise doubts about Sokola’s sexual assault allegations against him, noting that she did not mention a key claim for years, even in her own lawsuits. Sokola sued Weinstein several years ago over another allegation that was beyond the legal timeframe for potential criminal charges. Her lawsuits did not include anything about the alleged 2006 assault.Weinstein lawyer Mike Cibella pointed this out as he began questioning Sokola, suggesting she was financially motivated to make her latest allegations.\n Sokola, who’s embroiled in divorce proceedings, received about $3.5m in compensation from her lawsuits and from the Weinstein Co’s bankruptcy.Sokola said she had sued to gain financial independence from her estranged husband.“I was working at two jobs, and I was earning more money than he was,” she testified.Sign up to First ThingOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionJurors have already heard from former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley, 48, who testified that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in July 2006. Another accuser, Jessica Mann, is also set to take the stand in support of accusations that Weinstein raped her in 2013.The defendant is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley’s allegations and one count of third-degree rape in Mann’s case. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges and denies sexually assaulting anyone.Weinstein is already serving a 16-year sentence for a 2022 sexual-assault conviction in California. But that conviction, too, is being appealed on the same grounds that saw the first New York case overturned.He is being transported to the court daily from Bellevue hospital after his defense team filed an emergency petition last month seeking to transfer him from Rikers Island because he was suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes mellitus and “extensive” coronary artery disease.Weinstein’s defence team has so far called for a mistrial on three separate occasions, each denied by the presiding judge, Curtis Farber. The defendant is not charged with first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault – claims that failed in 2020 – because of double-jeopardy protections. The case continues.The Associated Press contributed reporting Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

            "content": "These are good times at Franklin’s Gardens. Five days after the squad celebrated one of the great victories against Leinster, four of them were picked by the British & Irish Lions. The atmosphere around the old ground has been electric ever since. And while you would expect the quartet, Fin Smith, Henry Pollock, Tommy Freeman, and Alex Mitchell, to be overjoyed, what’s more telling is how happy everyone else at the club seems to be on their behalf. The video of the team celebrating the news has already gone viral, and it turns out that on the night after the squad announcement, Fraser Dingwall had them all around to his house for a celebration dinner.Dingwall, of course, had an outside shot at making the Lions squad himself, but swallowed whatever disappointment he felt after being left out and opened a couple of bottles of champagne for the occasion.They’re a young bunch, Mitchell is 26, Freeman 24, Smith 22, Pollock 20 – between them their Lions memories don’t go back much further than the last tour to Australia back in 2013 – and have come up together. “It’s so special to do it with three of your best mates,” says Pollock, who was playing junior rugby this time last year, and, as Mitchell says, struggling to break into the Saints’ first team back at the start of this season.Pollock says he only really started thinking about the possibility of making the tour in the spring, when he made his England debut, then scored a spectacular try against Sale in the Premiership.Pollock’s utterly irrepressible; he has risen through the sport like one of those champagne corks Dingwall was firing on Thursday night.“He’s been fantastic, hasn’t he?” says Mitchell. “When he came through the academy last year, he had everything there, the energy, the talent, the mindset, so we knew he was going to be a quality player, but we just didn’t know how soon it was going to be.” Mitchell compares him to darts’ Luke Littler. “A lot of boys, when they come into the system, tend to overthink things, but Henry is just himself, he gives it his all, and he’s full of heart, and I think that’s what people love to see.”“He’s just nailing it, isn’t he?” Freeman says. “He’s unbelievable, just a hell of a character. You just want to give him stick, but you can’t until he plays crap,” and they’re all still waiting for him to do that. “I just hope he continues doing his thing and strutting about the way he does. I do think rugby needs characters, it needs people to stoke interest.”Of course Freeman is right behind him. He has been on a hell of a run himself, after scoring a try in every single round of the Six Nations, which put him in prime contention for a spot in the squad, and then rattled off a hat-trick in that semi-final against Leinster for good measure.“I was just trying to go about each week and try and ignore it all as much as I could,” Freeman says. “There were squads coming out with my name on it and squads that were coming out without it, so I was just trying to completely ignore it. And then when you sat down in that room for 30 minutes and you just start doubting yourself and questioning everything. You just never know until your name comes up.”Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionNewly selected Lion Tom Curry was replaced after only 24 minutes of Sale’s 44-34 defeat by Leicester on Friday night after sustaining a suspected leg injury. Alex Sanderson, the Sale director of rugby, said: “He felt something in his hamstring and we will have it scanned – it could always be serious. He is moving around and we took him off as a precaution. Tom is a tough lad and he tried to run it off for 10 minutes.”Mitchell was so nervous that he wasn’t even sure he wanted to watch the announcement with his teammates, “a few of us were like: ‘Should we watch it at home?’ But it was awesome having everyone there, an amazing experience.”Saints play Exeter this Sunday, but all four of them have been given the weekend off. They need it given how emotionally exhausting the last few days must have been. Mitchell says he was in bed by nine o’clock after leaving Dingwall’s little party. “I was shattered, the semi-final was hugely emotional, and then there were a lot of nerves on Wednesday and on Thursday.” And besides, they have a run of big fixtures coming up, with their home game against Saracens on 17 May leading into the final against Bordeaux-Begles a week later.The last time Saints had four players in the Lions was back in 1997 and this squad have a chance to do what that one went on to in 2000, and win the Champions Cup. Beyond that, of course, there’s the thought of that first Lions match against Argentina in Dublin on 20 June and the thought of all the fun and glory.",

            "content": "The first time the Glazer family visited Old Trafford, in June 2005, they paid a visit to the megastore. Outside, hundreds of furious Manchester United fans turned up with banners and placards, shouted slogans such as “Die Glazer die”, and a few clashed with police. Inside, the Glazers were doing a spot of – and here we must stretch the word to its broadest possible definition – shopping.For Joel, Avram and Bryan had no intention of doing anything quite as undignified as parting with their own cash. Instead they swarmed the aisles, scooped up armfuls of replica shirts and merchandise, which shop staff dutifully ran through the tills and bagged up. When the time came to leave, the Glazers simply took the bags and left. This was, after all, all their own property, theirs to take and use as they pleased. And as a metaphor for how they intended to run Manchester United over the next 20 years, it is about as good as any.Sir Bobby Charlton would later apologise to the Glazers for the hostile reception they received from fans on their first visit. David Gill, the chief executive who had initially resisted the takeover, was the man who greeted them at their car, smoothed the transition and was rewarded with a doubling of his salary. Sir Alex Ferguson, perhaps the one figure capable of stopping the takeover dead in its tracks, repeatedly refused to do so, telling a bunch of disgruntled fans on a trip to Budapest to “go and support Chelsea” if they were dissatisfied with the way United were being run.The Labour government, deep in election mode, refused to scrutinise the takeover despite the urging of many of its own MPs. And for all the diligent reporting of the takeover in many sections of the press, there were also plenty of journalists happy to take the inside line in return for a stream of Glazer PR. All of which serves, two decades on, as a reminder that for all their single-minded brazenness, the Glazers did not act alone.On the contrary: at every turn they were abetted by the pliant and the opportunistic, the spineless and the unprincipled. Dissent, whether from outraged fans or concerned directors, was either ignored or extinguished. Contrary to common belief, the Glazers did invest a little of their own money in buying United: much of it raised through refinancing of their retail property empire.But of course the bulk of the purchase was funded by debt. And not simply of the pecuniary kind, either: a debt of morals and safeguards, a debt of oversight and care, a debt of courage and conviction, an original sin for which not just United but English football as a whole is still paying heavily.Ferguson would continue not simply to tolerate the Glazers but to defend them at every opportunity. Seven years later, on a pre-season tour of South Africa, he rounded on United fans who still opposed the regime. “There are a whole lot of factions at United that think they own the club,” he said. “The majority of the real fans will look at it realistically and say it’s not affecting the team.”Many of Ferguson’s quotes have aged like fine wine. This one, it’s safe to say, has not. And not simply because performances on the pitch since his departure have shattered the illusion that the United trophy machine and the Glazer cash machine could somehow coexist in perpetuity. For in the sophistic dichotomy between “real fans” and fans who “think they own the club” is revealed a pure disdain for the paying public, a vision of the game in which the job of the fan is simply to cheer, to vindicate, while being told exactly what it is they should want.This sense of palpable disenfranchisement is perhaps the most toxic inheritance of the Glazer takeover. Unlike many of English football’s big recent takeovers – Chelsea, Manchester City, Newcastle, Arsenal – the sale of United has been loudly and vocally resisted at almost every turn. Many of the more disillusioned fans broke away to set up FC United of Manchester, still fighting the good fight in the Northern Premier League. There was the green and gold movement of 2010, the arrival and swift departure of the Red Knights, the protests of 2021 and 2022, the tireless and often thankless work of supporters’ groups.None of which really managed to move the dial. Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe now provide a public face and a handy lightning rod for criticism. Communications between the board and the fanbase have incrementally improved in the days since Gill refused even to engage with fan groups such as the Manchester United Supporters Trust on the basis that they were “at war with the owners”. There is now long-overdue investment in the training facility and a long-overdue new stadium in the planning.There are, as there always are, fleeting glimpses of promise on the pitch. But the fundamentals of the transaction have not altered. The Glazers are still there, still unmovable, still loading the club with debt and debt interest that totals more than £1bn since the takeover. And £1bn is a lot of money. It would certainly have paid for a lot of the staff laid off so indelicately by Ratcliffe over the past few months. It would have funded significant improvements to Old Trafford. It would have made a very handy transfer war chest for Ruben Amorim. Where can it have gone?Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionBy a weird coincidence, £1bn is not a million miles away from the amount of money – net – that the Glazers are estimated to have earned from United in annual dividends and share sales, once you take out their initial outlay. And of course they fattened the asset appreciably in the meantime. The piecemeal sponsorship model – in which every part of the club was essentially reimagined as a high-end advertising space – became the dominant commercial model in the sport.The audacity of purchasing the club using high-interest hedge-fund loans is spoken of in reverentially hushed tones within the game. The reimagination of transfer business as a form of theatre – an instrument not simply of team-building but of branding, clout, supporter PR – is another phenomenon not invented by United but certainly perfected by them. The re-signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 – a transfer that has to be seen in the context of the Super League protests earlier that year – made no sense for United the team, but was a clear win for United the brand, albeit one that has come with a heavy knock-on cost.This is, or was, your money. It came from your season ticket, your club shop purchase, your satellite television subscription, your Nissin noodle. For all the opacity and financial jargon, perhaps the simplest way of conceiving the Glazer takeover is as a kind of aggressive counter-revolution: a massive direct transfer of wealth from the fan to the owner. And in the process, the sanctification of the principle that a football club does not exist for its public, or for its community, or for its heritage, but purely as a vehicle for generating wealth for one family, for as long as they choose.Have we learned anything in two decades? The leveraged buyout was finally banned in 2023, the independent regulator is finally being winched into existence, and across the sport there is a greater awareness of the dangers of malign ownership, of unaccountable power, of creating a class that is basically untouchable. For all this precious little has changed at United except the league position, except the evaporation of hope and the increasingly forlorn balance sheet.In the meantime, the Glazers continue to sit upon their still-appreciating asset, monarchs atop the throne of rentier capitalism. Meanwhile your club has no money. Your council has no money. Your government has no money. Your family has no money. Everyone you know is fighting ever more bitterly over smaller and smaller slices of what we once comically believed was our common inheritance. The Glazer ownership of Manchester United is a sporting tragedy. But in a way, it’s also a parable for where we all went wrong.",

            "content": "Indiana’s governor, Mike Braun, has signed a landmark bill that would strip charity hospitals of their non-profit status if they continue to charge high prices.The legislation, the first of its kind in the United States, followed uproar across the state after a Guardian series in October that investigated how one major Indiana non-profit hospital system bought up its competition, then hiked its prices, leaving businesses and patients struggling to pay their medical costs.In the wake of the Guardian investigation, Braun, then the Republican gubernatorial candidate, and his Democratic rival both criticized the hospital system, Parkview Health, for its high prices, and lawmakers vowed to take action against the non-profit chain, which charged some of the highest prices in the country despite being based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the US’s most affordable metro area.Braun signed the legislation into law on Tuesday. It comes at a time of growing concern across the US about healthcare costs and medical debt.To implement the law, the Indiana office of management and budget will first study prices across the state and come up with a price benchmark for non-profit hospitals in consultation with the legislature, according to the bill’s author, Martin Carbaugh, a Republican representative who represents a district that includes Fort Wayne. Non-profit hospitals will then have until 2029 to get their prices under that average, though Carbaugh hopes some will lower their prices before then as they negotiate with insurers.“We’ll start to see the downward pressure put on them right away,” he said. “The hospitals know they can’t just go for broke and raise costs, only to have to lower it again in 2029.”According to data compiled by Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare, an Indiana advocacy group, the legislation could result in average price reductions as large as 40% for Parkview, and similarly sized cuts for other large state hospital systems.“It’s gonna be beneficial to everybody,” said Doug Allen, a small business owner who has struggled to keep up with Parkview’s healthcare costs for his employees. “Maybe people won’t be hurting so bad. Maybe they won’t think twice before coming to the hospital. Almost everybody around here is on a payment plan with Parkview. Everybody owes money to Parkview.”Parkview Health did not respond to requests for comment but has previously said it is committed to lowering healthcare costs.In a statement, the Indiana Hospital Association said it was “concerned by the potential loss of non-profit status for hospitals based on meeting an unknown statewide average commercial price in the future. This does not take into consideration the uncertainty of rising cost pressures such as tariffs, inflation, and other significant economic factors that will further threaten the financial stability of Indiana’s health care ecosystem.”The group added that it looks forward to “continuing our work with legislators and Gov Braun’s administration on future solutions that strike the right balance of lowering costs while maintaining access for Hoosier patients”.The US spends far more on healthcare than other large, wealthy countries, a trend that has been exacerbated by decades of hospital consolidation limiting competition in the healthcare sector. \n  Carbaugh said he was aware of how high healthcare prices are across the country and said Indiana’s legislation might be a model for other states too.\n  “It’s great to be a leader,” he said. “I’m happy to be part of leading that charge.”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/white-house-pentagon-hegseth-chief-of-staff",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 19:58",
            "content": "Exasperated by the turmoil that has dogged Pete Hegseth’s office in recent weeks, the White House will block the US defense secretary’s choice of chief of staff and select a candidate of its own, according to two people familiar with the matter.Hegseth had suggested giving the chief of staff position to Marine Col Ricky Buria after the first person in the role, Joe Kasper, left last month in the wake of a contentious leak investigation that brought the ouster of three other senior aides.But the White House has made clear to Hegseth that Buria will not be elevated to become his most senior aide at the Pentagon, the people said, casting Buria as a liability on account of his limited experience as a junior military assistant and his recurring role in internal office drama.“Ricky will not be getting the chief position,” one of the people directly familiar with deliberations said. “He doesn’t have adequate experience, lacks the political chops and is widely disliked by almost everyone in the White House who has been exposed to him.”The White House has always selected political appointees at agencies through the presidential personnel office, but the move to block Hegseth’s choice at this juncture is unusual and reflects Donald Trump’s intent to keep Hegseth by trying to insulate him from any more missteps.The intervention comes at a time when Hegseth’s ability to run the Pentagon has come under scrutiny. It also runs into the belief inside Trump’s orbit that even the president might struggle to justify Hegseth’s survival if the secretary does not have a scandal-free next few months.The secretary is not expected to have to fire Buria after he agreed to a compromise: to accept the White House’s choice for a new chief of staff in exchange for keeping Buria as a senior adviser, the people said. The White House and Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.The internal staffing situation at the Pentagon has outsize consequences because Hegseth’s front office is involved in policy deliberations and sensitive decision-making at the defense department, which has a budget of more than $800bn and oversees more than 2 million troops.Hegseth’s office is currently operating at a fraction of the size it normally does, with roughly five senior advisers. “There’s so much that’s not happening because no one is managing the front office,” an official with knowledge of the situation said.The possibility of Buria becoming chief of staff spooked the White House for multiple reasons. For one, the White House presidential personnel office previously declined Hegseth’s request to make him a political appointee, but Buria has been operating in such a capacity anyway, two officials said.Buria appears to be considered by the career civilian employees in the deputy defense secretary’s office as the acting chief, not least because he recently moved into the chief of staff’s office and has taken steps to redecorate by bringing in new furniture, the officials said.Buria also recently failed to pass a polygraph test that was administered as part of the leak investigation. The polygraph came back as inconclusive, the officials said, a result that would ordinarily require him to retake the test before he could be cleared.In an additional twist, Buria was identified as having sent some of the messages in at least one Signal group chat about sensitive and imminent US missile strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, the officials said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on Buria’s access to Hegseth’s personal phone.Buria, a former MV-22 pilot who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, started his ascent at the Pentagon as a junior military assistant (JMA) under Joe Biden’s defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. In the prestigious but unglamorous role, a JMA is something of a personal aide but with access to high-level operations.When Hegseth arrived, Buria continued his role as the JMA and quickly became close with Hegseth and his wife, Jennifer, traveling with the secretary and spending time at the secretary’s residence at Fort McNair.Buria’s influence expanded after Hegseth fired his boss, the air force Lt Gen Jennifer Short, who had been serving as the senior military assistant. Buria stepped into the job, typically held by a three-star officer, and joined bilateral meetings with foreign dignitaries. The National Pulse reported he also attended foreign policy briefings.When Army Lt Gen Christopher LaNeve arrived as Hegseth’s permanent senior military assistant, it was expected that Buria would return to his JMA position. Instead, he told officials he would retire from the military to become a political appointee in Hegseth’s office and took advantage of the power vacuum resulting from Kasper’s departure.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 19:48",
            "content": "US officials are discussing a plan to pull Greenland into America’s sphere of influence using a type of agreement that the United States has used to keep close ties with several Pacific Island nations, according to two US officials and another person familiar with the discussions.Under the plan being considered, the Trump administration would propose to Greenland’s leaders that the island enter into a so-called compact of free association, or Cofa, with the United States.While the precise details of Cofa agreements – which have only ever been extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau – vary depending on the signatory, the US government typically provides many essential services, from mail delivery to emergency management to military protection. In exchange, the US military operates freely in Cofa countries and trade with the US is largely duty-free.Donald Trump, who during his first administration floated the idea of acquiring Greenland, has pressed even harder since taking office in January, refusing to rule out taking the island by force. Denmark, which governs the island, has sharply rebuffed the idea.A Cofa agreement would stop short of Trump’s ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the US. It is not the only Greenland plan on the table, the sources said, and it would face many practical hurdles.Some officials at the national security council and the national energy dominance council, which Trump established, are involved in the talks, two of the sources said. The national economic council is also involved, one of those sources added.Cofa agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would probably need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. While polls show Greenlanders are interested in independence, surveys also show most do not want to be part of the US. A Cofa – which cedes significant autonomy to Washington – could be viewed with similar skepticism.One of those involved in the discussions is Markus Thomi, the acting senior director for the national security council’s western hemisphere section, according to two of the sources. David Copley, the key mining official on the NEDC, is also involved in the talks, one of those sources said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Danish embassy or Greenland’s representative office in Washington.The interior department, which plays a key role in administering Cofa agreements through its office of insular affairs, also did not respond.\n Washington’s existing Cofa agreements with Palau, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia are seen across the US political spectrum as important for countering China’s growing influence in the Asia Pacific region.Still, such accords have hit snags in the past.Republican lawmakers have at times opposed elements of the budget allotted to fund Cofa agreements, creating deep frustrations in the countries that rely on the funds.\n  Signing a Cofa also offers no guarantee that a nation will be immune from influence operations by US rivals.Danish leaders have not been approached about the idea and have not had any substantive discussions with the White House about Greenland’s future status, one senior European official said. Danish officials have publicly rejected the idea of the US acquiring Greenland, and insist Greenlanders must determine their future.Administration officials argue the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals that have important hi-tech and military applications, but which remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and various other challenges.An administration official told Reuters the US was helping Greenland diversify its economy and gain greater economic independence from Denmark. The Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank could play a role in that process, the official said.The official said a Cofa “could be an elegant way to address some of the concerns that we have when it comes to Greenland security” but did not otherwise comment on the possibility of such an accord.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 19:30",
            "content": "A plan to fast-track the appeals of asylum seekers living in government-funded hotels could face multiple legal challenges on the grounds of discrimination, the government has said.A 24-week legal deadline on appeal decisions for those staying in hotel rooms is being introduced in an attempt to fulfil a Labour manifesto promise to end a practice that costs the taxpayer billions of pounds a year.More than 38,000 asylum seekers are housed in 222 hotels and a further 66,000 people are in “dispersal accommodation”, such as large houses, bedsits and flats.The government has said it wants to stop using hotels by 2029 through a series of policies, including a quicker appeal process for those living in such accommodation whose initial asylum application has been rejected.But officials have conceded in a legal memorandum to the border security, asylum and immigration bill that the new deadline could be challenged under the European convention on human rights (ECHR) by both those staying in hotels and those living without government support.Officials have warned that article 14 of the ECHR prohibits discrimination and that there is a risk that those in hotels will “not have sufficient time to prepare and present their case in a manner that is fair and in the interests of justice (due to delays in obtaining legal representation or expert evidence)”.It is further argued that the “remaining non-prioritised cohort” who are appealing against an asylum decision could be “unjustifiably delayed” by the policy. The memorandum concludes that “in respect of both scenarios, there is a risk of article 14 discrimination”.In its legal note, the government is said to remain confident that the law is compatible with the ECHR as the tribunal hearing the appeals will have the flexibility to not meet the deadline where “it is not reasonably practicable to do so”. “Accordingly, the government is satisfied that the clause is compatible with article 14 of the ECHR,” it says.The acknowledgment of the potential for the policy to be challenged will raise concerns over its credibility. Concerns around immigration were widely seen as a driving force behind the success of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party in the recent local elections.The government plans to publish an immigration white paper next week that is expected to include measures such as the requirement that those applying for a UK work visa will have to demonstrate they can speak English to A-level standard. It is also expected to include plans to restrict asylum seekers’ ability to stay in the UK due to family connections.But the use of hotels to house asylum seekers remains a concern for many voters. Those staying within them have also become targets for the far right, including during last summer’s riots.This week the National Audit Office reported that the cost of the 10-year contract signed in 2019 with the three private providers responsible for housing asylum seekers would be an estimated £15.3bn.Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionThree-quarters of the money spent on asylum accommodation goes on hotels although they only account for about a third of those being housed. The estimated cost of shared housing for each person a night is £14.41, while the equivalent cost for a night of hotel accommodation for one person is £145.The government has said it will increase court maintenance and building funding from £120m last year to £148.5m this year. It is claimed this will boost the number of days the immigration and asylum tribunal will be sitting to near maximum capacity, helping to speed up asylum claims.A government spokesperson said: “We inherited an asylum system under exceptional pressure and have taken immediate action to restore order: increasing asylum decision-making by 52% and returning more than 24,000 people with no right to be here, the highest rate of returns in eight years.“It is right that we set out in law the need to speed up appeals from those in asylum accommodation to keep people moving through the system, help hotel exits and in turn reduce the burden on taxpayers.“To support this work, we are providing new funding for both immigration and asylum tribunals, so they have extra resources to sit at near capacity.”",

            "content": "Simon Mann, an Eton and Sandhurst-educated ex-SAS officer, who led a botched coup involving Margaret Thatcher’s son to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea, has died aged 72.Mann led a group of 70 fellow mercenaries who were arrested in Zimbabwe in 2004 for attempting to topple Equatorial Guinea’s despotic president, Teodoro Obiang.Mann and his friend Mark Thatcher admitted involvement in the attempted plot, which became known as the “wonga coup”. When the plot was revealed, Obiang threatened to eat Mann’s testicles and drag his naked body through the streets.Mann served more than five years in two of the world’s most notorious jails before being pardoned by Obiang himself.He had previously served in the Scots Guards and the SAS before setting up a number of security firms specialised in protecting oil installations.In March 2004 Mann, Nick du Toit and three other South African mercenaries plotted Obiang’s overthrow with international financial backers and the tacit approval of at least three governments, most notably Spain.The coup involved flying into the former Spanish colony in a plane loaded with arms and more than 50 black “Buffalo soldiers” – former members of the now disbanded South African defence forces’ elite 32 battalion– to replace Obiang with an exiled opposition activist called Severo Moto.In return, the plotters and their backers were hoping to tap into Equatorial Guinea’s reserves of oil and natural gas. But their plane was intercepted by the Zimbabweans at Harare airport. A jubilant President Robert Mugabe threw Mann and his fellow conspirators into jail before handing them over to Equatorial Guinea where a court sentenced the mercenary to 34 years in jail.In a note sent out to his legal team while he was being held, Mann implicated Thatcher, whom he referred to by the name Scratcher, in the coup. The note also pleaded for a “large splodge of wonga” and that Thatcher use his influence to secure his release.In his trial, Mann admitted he had been approach by Ely Calil, a Lebanese oil tycoon who was a friend of Moto, who regarded himself as head of Equatorial Guinea’s government in exile.Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionThatcher was alleged to have paid for a helicopter to fly Moto from Equatorial Guinea during the planned coup. He was fined and given a four-year suspended sentence for his part in the coup after admitting breaking anti-mercenary legislation. But he claimed he was only unwittingly involved in the plot.In 2006 the plot was dramatised in Coup!, a TV movie written by the comic John Fortune.After his pardon, Mann returned to the UK. He was married three times and had nine children. MailOnline reported that he had died earlier this week while exercising in a gym.",

            "title": "‘Look forward, not back’: UK keen for closer trade ties with EU, says Starmer",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/09/uk-ambitious-secure-closer-trade-partnership-with-eu-keir-starmer",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 19:00",
            "content": "The UK has “ambitious” plans to secure a closer trading partnership with the EU, Keir Starmer has said, as he argued the British public had moved on from Brexit.Before a UK-EU summit, the prime minister urged people to “look forward, not back” as the country embarked on a new era of its relationship with the bloc.At the end of a week in which Starmer has struck trade deals with the US and India, he indicated the UK would align with the EU on food standards, work more closely on law enforcement and that he would support a controlled youth mobility scheme.It marks the start of a big political offensive by the government to explain the benefits of closer ties with the EU, amid some anxiety within Labour over how Reform UK will respond to the deal.Frustrations are beginning to emerge in the EU over what it sees as a cautious approach by the government to its request for a reset in the relationship, in part because of the electoral threat from Nigel Farage’s party.The summit will be held in Downing Street, prompting some to speculate it had been downsized after reports it would be held at Lancaster House. However, sources say it was “never meant to be big, just EU institution leaders and UK leaders”.\n In an interview onboard HMS St Albans during a visit to Norway, Starmer told the Guardian: “I’m ambitious about what we can achieve there. I want a closer relationship on security, on defence, on trade and on the economy.“The mindset is important and this is, I think, a shared approach. Let’s look forward, not back. Let’s recognise we’re living in a different world. We’re in a new era on security and defence. Equally, we’re in a new era on trade and the economy now.“What President Trump is doing through his tariffs is for a purpose and we need to recognise that the way we lower barriers with like-minded partners really matters.”Asked whether he believed the public had moved on enough from Brexit and if the public would understand the benefits of his EU reset, Starmer said: “I think so.\n “Because I think people are focused on how we get the economy moving. How do I feel better off? How do we get more money into our public services and how do we protect my job? And it’s important to ask the question: who have you got in your mind’s eye when you make decisions?”There had been high hopes on the EU side that the stage would be set for a deeper relationship at the summit due to be held in London on 19 May.But some EU diplomats are concerned the UK’s appetite for a closer deal has been tempered by the success of Reform UK in the local elections, and by reaction to concessions to the Indian government over national insurance exemptions for staff seconded temporarily to the UK. One said: “Everyone is very sensitive to how a closer relationship lands in the UK.”Business leaders are also apprehensive about the outcome of the summit, saying they want to go faster and deeper to claw back the loss of growth caused by Brexit. “The logic of being closer to the EU is inarguable but the fear is the politics are going to limit it,” one said.The governor of the Bank of England said he hoped the UK could “rebuild” trade relationships with the EU after striking a trade deal with the US. Andrew Bailey said it would be “beneficial” to reverse the post-Brexit reduction in UK-EU trade. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that Brexit reduced the UK economy’s long-run productivity by 4%.Meanwhile, the government said it was willing to pay for UK companies to gain access to EU defence spending programmes worth hundreds of billions of pounds, after resistance from the French to give it access amid disputes over fishing rights.The defence secretary, John Healey, told the BBC: “We are prepared to pay our fair share but we want to have a say in the programmes, while retaining UK intellectual property and export opportunities.”Sign up to Headlines UKGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningafter newsletter promotionIn his interview, Starmer said the “calm and pragmatic” approach he had taken in negotiations with the US and India to secure trade deals would also get an agreement with the EU over the line.Starmer travelled on to Ukraine where he will join the leaders of France, Poland and Germany at a meeting of the “coalition of the willing” with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday to underline their ongoing commitment to the country.The four major European defence powers, travelling to Kyiv together for the first time, comes as they and the US president, Donald Trump, called Russia to agree a 30-day ceasefire and come to the negotiating table.Contrasting the government’s approach with Tory administrations’ dealings with Brussels, he said: “We will do this in a serious, pragmatic way, and we won’t rush to the nearest microphone every time there’s a twist or turn in the negotiations.”He backed Nick Thomas-Symonds, the minister for EU relations, who publicly confirmed this week the UK was looking at setting up a controlled youth mobility scheme with the EU. “We’re pragmatists, and that’s the approach that we bring to these negotiations. We’ve got red lines, but we’re pragmatists,” Starmer said.However, government sources indicated that even if the youth mobility pact was mentioned as part of the reset agreement later this month, it would only be properly explored at a later date.Starmer also suggested the UK would align with the EU on food and other standards as part of the deal. “We do not want to lower our standards on food. We are not involved in, nor will we be involved in, a sort of race to the bottom on standards,” he said. “I think that British people are proud of the high standards that we have, and we want to maintain those standards.”The prime minister also accepted there would be a role for the European court of justice in resolving any disputes, as was already the case for the Northern Ireland border deal struck by Rishi Sunak. He said: “There’s already a role for the ECJ. Look at the Windsor agreement, that’s already there, and I think most people feel that the Windsor framework was a step forward.”\n He added that the UK was pushing for a closer relationship with the EU on law enforcement.“I do want to work more closely together. I do want to ensure we get the best possible arrangements for data sharing. I’d like us to work more with Europol and put ourselves in a position where the UK can lead investigations in Europol. We’re very good at it. So the ambition there is to work as closely as possible.”",

            "title": "Newark airport sees second air traffic blackout amid weeks of major delays",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/newark-second-air-traffic-blackout",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 18:53",
            "content": "Newark airport, one of the main hubs serving the New York City area, suffered another blackout of its air traffic control system, early on Friday morning, according to US aviation regulators – the second in recent weeks of disrupted flights that have become a major concern for passengers.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that a key air traffic control facility in Philadelphia that guides aircraft in and out of Newark Liberty international airport in New Jersey had a malfunction.The FAA said the radar at the facility went black for 90 seconds at 3.55am on Friday – an event that is similar to an communications breakdown on 28 April that led to hundreds of flights being cancelled or delayed at the airport over the last two weeks. Such a situation is rare and automatically sparks grave concern from the industry and regulators.The latest failure comes a day after the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, announced a full modernization of creaky US air traffic control systems within four years, including replacing radio and surveillance systems with modern technology.“We are on it. We are going to fix it. We are going to build a brand new system for all of you and your families and the American people,” Duffy said on Thursday.The FAA said earlier this week that it is installing new fiber optic data lines to carry the radar signal between its facilities in Philadelphia and New York. Officials said some of the lines connecting those two facilities are outdated copper wire.There were 320 delays and 137 cancellations reported at Newark, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware, as of 12.15pm on Friday.After the latest outage affecting Newark, one the nation’s busiest airports, the FAA said in a statement: “There was a telecommunications outage that impacted communications and radar display at Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport airspace.”“The outage occurred around 3.55am on Friday, May 9, and lasted approximately 90 seconds,” it added.Separately, the regulator issued a ground stop at the airport, due to construction, that was in effect until mid-morning on Friday.Josh Gottheimer, Democrat congressman of New Jersey, said the second outage was “big news”.“Travelers have had it with the delays. I’ve heard from a lot of them. They’re calling me, they’re talking to me. You see them posting about the delays, about the cancellations,” Gottheimer told reporters at Newark airport on Friday, according to Fox Business.Gottheimer added that travelers “are frustrated about and angry about and concerned about is because right now, the airport simply lacks the FAA tower staffing levels, modern technology and infrastructure that we need to make sure that this airspace, the busiest airspace in the world, runs efficiently, smoothly and safely, 24/7”.Last week’s outage, which occurred in the afternoon, left controllers with no way to communicate with pilots. Several were reportedly so distressed that they took a leave of absence, further snarling air traffic operations.After Friday’s blackout, publicly available communications between air traffic control and pilots revealed an exchange with the pilot of a FedEx flight bound for Boston, who was advised to switch radio frequency.“FedEx 1989, I’m going to hand you off here, our scopes just went black again,” the controller said. “If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.”“Sorry to hear about that, FedEx 1989,” the pilot said. “I’m switching, good luck guys.”The Associated Press contributed reporting",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 18:45",
            "content": "The Women’s World Cup will expand to 48 teams from the 2031 tournament onwards after the proposal was approved by the Fifa council on Friday.The UK is set to host the event in 2035 and that tournament will now involve 12 groups of four teams and more than 100 matches, with the format mirroring the newly expanded men’s World Cup. It is understood Fifa took this decision after consulting the continental confederations and believe expansion of its most important tournament befits the rapid growth of the women’s game.The World Cup increased in size from 24 to 32 teams for the 2023 event in Australia and New Zealand. It will again have 32 teams for the 2027 edition in Brazil. The eight venues for 2027’s event – including the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro – were confirmed earlier this week.The United States is set to stage the 2031 tournament after there were no competing bids to stage either that or the 2035 event. The US and UK are yet to be formally ratified as the hosts but that is expected to be a formality.The expansion of the Women’s World Cup could mean an increased number of host cities and stadiums will be required in the UK’s 2035 tournament plans. Alongside Wembley, Hampden Park and Cardiff’s Principality Stadium, it is thought as-yet unbuilt venues such as Manchester United’s new stadium and Birmingham City’s proposed new 62,000-seater home could both be in contention to host matches, if built in time.Fifa has also approved a three-pillar strategy for Afghan women’s football, including the establishment of a women’s refugee team, as reported in March.The three pillars of the plan mean the global governing body will provide “project-specific support for women and girls in Afghanistan”, while taking into account the limitations there, embark on “advocacy and diplomatic engagement with relevant actors” in the Taliban-led country and enhance playing opportunities and support for players outside of the country.The third pillar includes the establishment of a team of evacuated players of Afghan nationality who will be able to participate in friendlies and tournaments organised by Fifa and will “provide a supportive environment that prioritises player safety and wellbeing”.However, it is understood the decision has come too late for a team to qualify for the 2027 World Cup, with Afghanistan not entered into the June qualifying campaign for the 2026 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, which will determine World Cup qualification.Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballafter newsletter promotionThe refugee team will be organised for a one-year pilot phase, after which its long-term viability, effectiveness and the potential of the format being used for other refugee groups will be assessed.Khalida Popal, founder of the Afghanistan women’s national team said: “We are proud to be part of history in helping create Fifa’s first ever refugee football team … but remain hopeful Fifa can amend its statutes to provide official recognition for our players as the Afghanistan women’s national team.”Andrea Florence, executive director of the Sport & Rights Alliance, said: “This first step from Fifa to create an Afghan women’s refugee team is a testament to the tireless advocacy and persistence of the Afghan women players. Yet it is important to note that this does not fully address the ongoing gender discrimination by the Afghanistan Football Federation as it continues to ban women from playing and the matches of the AWRT will not count toward their official ranking.”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/09/pope-leo-xiv-watched-conclave-movie",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 18:44",
            "content": "Vatican watchers weren’t the only ones consulting the movie Conclave before the pivotal election of a new pope.The new pontiff himself – Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who took the name Leo XIV – watched the 2024 movie dramatizing the Vatican’s selection process ahead of the sequestration of cardinals that chose him to lead the Catholic church, according to his older brother.John Prevost, the middle of three Prevost brothers – Robert, now the first American pope, is the youngest – told NBC affiliate WMAQ-TV in their native Chicago that he spoke with his younger brother a day before the conclave began.“I said: ‘Are you ready for this? Did you watch the movie Conclave, so you know how to behave?’ And he had just finished watching the movie,” Prevost laughed. “So he knew how to behave.”The elder Prevost added: “I wanted to take his mind off of it [the real conclave], you know, laugh about something because this is now an awesome responsibility.”The drama-thriller directed by Edward Berger, based on the 2016 novel by Robert Harris, dramatized the selection process of a new pope following the death of a widely popular, moderate one. The fictional film, though based on real details, processes and dynamics within the insular Vatican, depicts political intrigue, gossip and rivalries within the church, ultimately culminating in the election of a surprise outsider candidate.In real life, the new Leo XIV was on few shortlists for pope, given that no American had ever been chosen to lead the Catholic church, and the fact that he was named cardinal only two years ago. According to his brother, Prevost himself doubted his chances.“He didn’t think so,” John Prevost said. “I didn’t believe it and Rob didn’t believe it – I should say Pope Leo didn’t believe it at all, because there’s not going to be an American pope was the attitude.”John Prevost did think his brother was in serious contention, however. “What I was reading and what I was hearing was that there were three outstanding candidates that were in first, second and third place,” he said, “the cardinal from the Philippines, the [Vatican] secretary of state, and him [Robert].”After a relatively short conclave – a day and four rounds of voting that ended on Thursday evening, local time – Pope Leo XIV assumed the role vacated by Pope Francis, who died aged 88 last month after a long period of ill health, with an address in Spanish and Italian to the many gathered in St Peter’s Square. (The new pope has spent most of his ecclesiastical career in Peru, and is a naturalized citizen of the South American country.) Now tasked with shepherding the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics through increasingly turbulent times, he will probably have little time for movies. But his brother provided some insight on how he likes to unwind from serious responsibilities.“First we do Wordle, because this is a regular thing, OK,” John Prevost said. “We do Words with Friends. It’s something to keep his mind off life in the real world.”Prevost also shared his family’s reaction to the news that his brother had become the 267th pope in history, and the first pontiff from the US. “It’s totally unreal, it’s totally surreal,” he said. “It’s a tremendous thing to take in, but it’s something to be very proud of.”",

            "content": "The US deal on steel tariffs imposes conditions on the “nature of ownership” of British plants as part of its efforts to freeze out Chinese steel, it has emerged.It is understood Donald Trump’s administration pushed for requirements to be attached to the steel deal to ensure that the Chinese-owned British Steel plant in Scunthorpe was not used by Beijing as a backdoor to circumvent US tariffs.Government sources say Washington is understood to be reassured that Scunthorpe is now in effect controlled by Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, and is likely not to come back under the direction of Jingye Group, its Chinese owners.However, before the UK government took steps to seize control of British Steel last month the US had been concerned that the Scunthorpe plant could have been used as a base for processing Chinese steel to take advantage of lower tariffs.The US-UK deal, agreed on Thursday, has come as a relief to the car and steel industries, which had been worried about job losses, although some of the terms are still unclear. It is set to bring car tariffs down to 10% and steel tariffs to zero if conditions are met.Peter Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the US, said the deal had immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover’s plant in the West Midlands. “This deal has saved those jobs,” Mandelson said in an interview on CNN. “That’s a pretty big achievement, in my view, and I’m very pleased that the president has signed it.”Government sources said JLR had planned for imminent cuts among its 30,000 staff in the UK but had not informed unions in the hope that a deal with the US could be struck to eliminate the 25% tariffs on exports of cars to the US.Keir Starmer told ITV on Friday that the deal would be “measured in thousands and thousands of jobs that will be protected, saved and will thrive as a result” in steel, cars and in pharmaceuticals.Government sources said the UK was still working with the US to define the exact requirements for the quota of steel allowed to be exported tariff-free, looking at the security of the supply chain and on ownership, so that the deal could be introduced as soon as possible.The text of the agreement makes clear that US steel tariffs of 25% will be lowered only if certain US requirements are met on the “security of supply chains” and the “nature of ownership of the relevant production facilities”.It says: “Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota at most favored nation (MFN) rates for UK steel and aluminum and certain derivative steel and aluminum products.”Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, boasted on Thursday: “The British government as part of this deal nationalised British Steel.”UK sources said the US had not pushed Britain towards nationalising British Steel but had been impressed with the action taken against its Chinese owners before Easter.Chrysa Glystra, the director of trade and economic policy at UK Steel, the industry body said: “The terms of the deal highlight a number of hoops to jump through before the UK steel sector can see the benefits of this deal.”The UK exports about 200,000 metric tons of steel per year to the US, which is worth about £400m.Glystra said it was still not clear what the terms and conditions of the tariff exemption were or when it would kick in, underlining the admission by government sources that they settled on a quick deal to “bank progress” and save jobs in the car industry.“To fully assess the impact on our sector, we will need to fully understand the supply chain conditions that need to be met, how the quotas will be defined and when these will take effect,” Glystra added.Trump, who has now turned his attention to the first trade talks between the US and China in Geneva on Saturday, said the “final details [of the UK deal] are being written up in the coming weeks”.There had been reports that the deal in effect handed the US a veto on Chinese investment in UK sectors covered by the deal but No 10 said this was not the case.",

            "content": "Immigrants in Texas who were told they would be deported to Libya sat on a military airfield tarmac for hours on Wednesday, unsure of what would happen next, an attorney for one of the men has said.The attorney, Tin Thanh Nguyen, told the news agency Reuters that his client, a Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles, was among the immigrants woken in the early morning hours and bussed from an immigration detention center in Pearsall, Texas, to an airfield where a military aircraft awaited them.After several hours, they were bussed back to the detention center around noon, the attorney said on Thursday.The Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and the state department did not respond to requests for comment.Reuters was first to report that the Trump administration was poised to deport immigrants held in the US to Libya, despite a court order against such a move, in a development that would escalate Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.Officials earlier this week told Reuters the US military could fly the immigrants to the north African country as soon as Wednesday, but stressed that plans could change.A US official said the flight never departed. As of Friday, it was unclear if the administration was still planning to proceed with the deportations.A federal judge in Boston ruled on Wednesday that any effort by the Trump administration to deport non-Libyan immigrants to Libya without adequate screenings for possible persecution or torture would clearly violate a prior court order.Lawyers for a group of immigrants pursuing a class action lawsuit had made an emergency request to the court hours after the news broke of the potential flight to Libya.Nguyen, who declined to name his client, said the man was told on Monday to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya. The man, who can not read English well, declined to sign it and was placed in solitary confinement and shackled along with others, the attorney said.The man was never provided an opportunity to express a fear of being deported to Libya as required under federal immigration law and the recent judicial order, Nguyen said.“They said: ‘We’re deporting you to Libya,’ even though he hadn’t signed the form, he didn’t know what the form was,” Nguyen said.Nguyen said his client, originally from Vietnam, has lived in the US since the 1990s but was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) earlier this year during a regular check-in, which is becoming more common.Vietnam declines to accept some deportees and processes deportation paperwork slowly, Nguyen said, making it harder for the US to send deportees there.There have been talks between the US and the east African nation of Rwanda about also deporting people there.",

            "content": "The Conservative party is fighting to justify its existence amid concerns that its pipeline of future voters is “completely dead”, a former cabinet minister and leading thinktank director has said.Simon Clarke, an ally of Boris Johnson who backed Kemi Badenoch for the leadership last year, was among a string of former Tory ministers and serving MPs to tell the Guardian she faced removal by her party if she did not turn its fortunes around by next year’s local elections.He said the party needed to face up to the reality that it had “not had a clear, compelling narrative for a long time”, and that it must focus on intergenerational fairness, public services reform and the economy.His assessment came after a week of recriminations for the Conservatives over the local election results, with Badenoch telling activists she was sorry for the loss of more than 600 councillors.The 200-year-old party, which has traditionally vied only with Labour to lead the government, has recently slumped to about 17% in the polls, while Reform and the Lib Dems are increasing challengers to the two-party system.Nigel Farage’s Reform UK took more than 600 seats, and control of 10 councils as well as two mayoralties in a bruising night for the two main parties. Data shows that about 57 of the Reform councillors elected had previously stood for the Conservatives, and Tory MPs have reported losing many of their activists to Farage’s party, adding to its improved political organisation.Speaking to the Guardian about whether the Conservative party can recover and renew while being squeezed by both Labour and Reform UK, Clarke said he agreed with the former chancellor Jeremy Hunt that the party could not rule out becoming extinct.“I think that we have to accept that we are fighting to justify our existence and there is no point sugarcoating that reality. We do in particular need to come up with a positive offer for younger people. My single biggest concern, among many, is that the pipeline of future Conservative voters is completely dead.”The former communities secretary and senior Treasury minister, who now leads the thinktank Onward, said the Conservatives needed to “get into a better place on policy quite quickly” to avoid it being very hard to rebuild.“We need to come up with a serious, fair market offer, which in turn will allow us to right-size the public finances and re-earn our traditional territory of being the most responsible, pro-market party that’s on offer to voters,” he said.“That doesn’t happen overnight but that journey needs to begin right now because we saw last week [at the local elections] that if we don’t get into a better place on policy quite quickly then we are going to not just be wiped out nationally but locally, which will clearly make the route back very hard. The activists, the councillors you lose are very, very difficult to replace.”Badenoch was right to say it would be premature to offer a definitive manifesto now for a May 2029 election, Clarke said, but no one would disagree with setting out “animating principles” to underpin that.“At the moment, we are being defined by our opponents rather than our own actions and that does need to change,” he said.Steve Baker, a Eurosceptic former cabinet minister who lost his seat last year, and strongly backs Badenoch, said: “Next year there are council elections bigger than the ones we just had and if Kemi hasn’t turned things around by those elections it seems most likely to me that Conservative MPs will move against her. The practical brute politics is that – I wish it were otherwise – if Kemi doesn’t start paving the way next year she is going to be in danger from supporters of Robert Jenrick moving against her.”Baker said the Conservatives’ challenge was to deal with age-related problems in the economy and come up with a “clear idea of what the problems are that people face in their everyday life and work out how we answer those problems in a way that matters to normal voters ... We failed to answer the immigration question and have not adequately raised living standards.”He added that the party needed to support cutting “the winter fuel allowance, get rid of the triple lock which multiplies our difficulties with unfunded pension liabilities, and we’ve got to stop the public sector accruing extremely generous public sector pensions”.From the opposite wing of the Conservatives, Michael Heseltine, a former deputy prime minister and pro-European peer, said he believed the party would be able to recover but it needed to forge a better relationship with the EU and start making positive arguments about immigration as a force for good in the economy.“There’s nothing unprecedented in this situation,” Lord Heseltine said. “The Conservatives have been in difficult places before and they’ve always woken up to realise that winning in parliamentary democracies demands an understanding of what needs to be done for the country … They need to understand what British self-interest is about and have the courage to articulate it.”Earlier this week, Hunt, a former chancellor and health secretary, said the party could not rule out extinction and it would take a while to bounce back from a “massive earthquake” that has seen the two-party system fracture. The former chancellor George Osborne also weighed in on the Conservative party’s fortunes on Wednesday, saying the party was making a mistake focusing on culture wars and trying to ape Reform. He told LBC: “If we spoke a little bit less about transgender toilets and a bit more about taxes, then we might be on to something.”Additional reporting: Michael Goodier",

            "content": "A recording of Pink Floyd’s eerie and evocative 1972 gig in the ruins of Pompeii, entitled Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII, has become the band’s seventh UK chart-topping album.The album captures the gig that was documented by director Adrian Maben for one of rock’s most arresting concert films, which has been restored to 4K quality and rereleased in cinemas, including in Imax format. A recording of the gig was previously included as part of a larger Pink Floyd box set, but this is the first standalone version, featuring a new sound mix helmed by prog rock musician Steven Wilson.It is Pink Floyd’s first No 1 since 2014’s The Endless River, their final studio album. Atom Heart Mother (1970), Wish You Were Here (1975), The Final Cut (1983), The Division Bell (1994) and Pulse (1995) were their other UK chart-toppers.Despite going 16 times platinum and spending 578 weeks on the chart, The Dark Side of the Moon only ever reached No 2, having been held off the top in its March 1973 week of release by the forgotten compilation 20 Flash Back Greats of the Sixties. Classics such as Meddle, Animals and The Wall also placed in the Top 3 without reaching No 1, trumped by artists including Rod Stewart, the Shadows and Abba.Surprisingly, Pink Floyd at Pompeii – MCMLXXII isn’t the only new entry on this week’s chart from a British band performing amid the ruins of classical antiquity. Brit-poppers James are at No 27 this week with James (Live at the Acropolis), their July 2023 concert at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus beneath the Acropolis in Athens.Other new entries this week include Erasure’s Andy Bell, who earns his first solo entry on the chart, reaching No 4 with his third album, Ten Crowns. Sabrina Carpenter’s Short n’ Sweet spends its 37th straight week in the UK Top 5, hopping back to No 2.In the singles chart, Alex Warren’s Ordinary spends its eighth week at No 1, while at No 2 is US R&B singer Ravyn Lenae who continues to break through with her first UK hit, Love Me Not. Released in August 2024, it entered the chart in February at No 89 and has climbed every week since.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 17:59",
            "content": "Groups supporting clergy-molestation survivors say they are gravely concerned and insulted by the election of Pope Leo XIV after he overcame questions about his handling of clerical sexual abuse cases earlier in his career to become the Roman Catholic church’s first-ever US-born leader.Before Robert Prevost’s ascent to the papacy at age 69, he was leading a chapter of the Augustinian religious order in his home town of Chicago when allegations surfaced that a priest and Catholic high school principal under his jurisdiction had molested at least one student as well as kept child-abuse imagery.Prevost reportedly allowed that cleric to continue in his role despite the allegations, though the Augustinian order later paid a multimillion-dollar settlement to the abuse survivor and in December booted the priest from the order.Meanwhile, Prevost also did not impede another priest – whose ministry had been restricted in the wake of allegations that he abused minors – from living at an Augustinian residence that was near a Catholic elementary school. And, while serving as a bishop in Peru, Prevost heard from three women who accused two priests there of sexually abusing them as minors and have since claimed there is no evidence that much was done to investigate the cleric.That history prompted the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (Snap) to file a complaint against Prevost in March under church legislation implemented by the late Pope Francis that provided potential disciplinary measures against bishops who were found to have turned a blind eye to abuse of both children and adults considered vulnerable.The complaint did not prevent Leo from being elected on Thursday after a short conclave at the Vatican, which prompted Snap to quickly issue a statement expressing “grave concern about his record managing abuse cases”.“You can end the abuse crisis,” Snap’s statement said of Leo, who has not been accused of abuse himself and had previously headed the Vatican entity in charge of selecting new bishops from around the world. “The only question is: will you?”In a separate statement, the Survivors of Childhood Sex Abuse (SCSA) said Leo’s election was “an insult” given that he was produced by the same Catholic hierarchy that has failed to grapple with the scale and systemic nature of the global church’s decades-old clergy molestation scandal.“The Catholic hierarchy has not merely mishandled abuse allegations – it industrialized the process,” the SCSA’s statement said. “Pope Leo XIV … was in the rooms for all of it.”Both organizations urged Leo to implement a true zero-tolerance policy with respect to taking action against clergy abuse claims as well as to provide victims of the scandal with reparations from church assets, among other demands.Mitchell Garabedian, the Boston attorney who represented abuse survivors amid the clergy molestation scandal depicted in the Oscar-winning movie Spotlight, added: “The Catholic church has to understand that the safety of innocent children cannot be sacrificed for an outdated and inexcusable need to protect the reputation of the Catholic church.”The Vatican’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the statements from Snap and SCSA. It has generally maintained that Prevost is free of any wrongdoing or followed canonical norms in the clergy abuse cases he has confronted.Some of the scrutiny surrounding Prevost’s handling of those cases dates back to his 11-year tenure leading the Augustinian order’s midwest chapter in Chicago beginning in 1999. During that time, claims reportedly surged that the principal of Providence Catholic high school in New Lenox, Illinois, which was part of Prevost’s territory, had molested a student and possessed images of child abuse on his phone.Prevost – who was also the Augustinians’ worldwide leader for 12 years beginning in 2001 – left the principal, an Augustinian priest named Richard McGrath, in his post, a decision he has not explained, as the Chicago Sun-Times has previously reported.McGrath retired in 2017 after being faced with an investigation into the claims against him.The abused student, Robert Krankvich, then sued in 2018. And in late 2023 the church agreed to pay him $2m – before Krankvich died in April at age 43.“Money doesn’t bring happiness,” Krankvich’s father, also named Robert, said to the Sun-Times. “It gave him no closure.”During Krankvich’s lawsuit, McGrath declined to answer whether or not he possessed child abuse images, invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the Sun-Times reported. Yet McGrath denied molesting Krankvich and was kept off a list of alleged Augustinian abusers published in 2024, though he resigned in light of the claims against him.Nonetheless, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the Augustinians confirmed McGrath had been expelled from their order, according to New Lenox’s Patch news website.The Augustinians reportedly did not disclose the factors behind McGrath’s dismissal, which occurred in December but was first reported on the eve of the start of the two-day conclave that vaulted Prevost to the papacy.Separately, in 2000 and still early in Prevost’s stint as the midwestern US Augustinian chapter, the order stationed a member priest named James Ray in its St John Stone Friary in Chicago. The friary was adjacent to an elementary school, and since 1991, Ray was restricted from working around children because of accusations that he had molested minors. Survivors groups say those moves are not indicative of an organization doing everything it can to protect children. The Vatican has reportedly countered that Prevost was not the one who authorized Ray’s living arrangements at the friary.Prevost subsequently spent eight years as the bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, beginning in 2015. According to a statement that they issued, three women told Prevost directly that they had allegedly been abused as minors by local priests named Eleuterio Vásquez González and Ricardo Yesquén.But the women said they had no evidence any meaningful investigation into their claims ensued, and at one point they published several images showing Vásquez publicly celebrating mass on important occasions such as Easter despite purported assurances to them that he was suspended from such ministry, as the National Catholic Reporter noted in reporting on a case rife with conflicting claims.Chiclayo’s diocese reportedly said the Vatican agency which investigates clerical sexual abuse cases found insufficient evidence to substantiate the accusers’ allegations – and that local law enforcement authorities reached a similar conclusion, in part citing the lapse of an applicable statute of limitations.One of the accusers, Ana María Quispe, lamented in Spanish to the Peruvian television news program Cuarto Poder: “They have always told us the church is our mother – but a mother protects.”For its part, Chiclayo’s diocese reportedly said “it is not true” that Prevost and the church “turned its back on the alleged victims”. The diocese reportedly said the accusers remained free to pursue complaints in civil court and have a standing offer of church-provided “psychological help if they required it”.Francis, who died on 21 April, made Prevost a cardinal in September 2023. A reputation as a “moderating influence” among the ideologically disparate bishops in Peru evidently helped Leo clinch the papacy – somewhat unexpectedly – on Thursday.",

            "content": "There’s a great deal of warmth both in and out of the kitchen in Netflix’s remarkably charming new food comedy Nonnas, a simple yet satisfying fact-based crowd-pleaser landing just in time for Mother’s Day across many countries in the world. It’ll make for an easy post-lunch choice for families gathering this weekend, providing the sort of mechanically proficient pleasures that used to be far more common back in the 80s or 90s. The platform has tried, and mostly failed, to resurrect the kind of endlessly played, easily rewatchable cable movie favourite and while this still might not be quite as fondly remembered in the decades to come, it’s a better simulation than most.To those with less of an Italian component to their family, a nonna is a grandmother, the stereotype of which spends a great deal of time in the kitchen, preparing food with equal parts garlic and love. For Joe (Vince Vaughn, in reliable been-around-the-block mode), the death of both his nonna and then his mother has left him feeling unmoored, questioning what to do with himself and his life going forward. We’ve seen a great deal of stories based around sons and their fathers but it’s uncommon to explore what a mother means to a man in the same serious way, a strangely untapped relationship on screen. For Joe, the loss has led to a pervading chill and his unlikely solution is to use the money from her life insurance to open a restaurant in Staten Island.He’s a decent cook, having watched and learned in the kitchen for most of his life, but he needs help. His idea is to rely on the wisdom and experience of nonnas, first his mother’s stern longtime best friend (Lorraine Bracco) and then, through an ad on Craigslist, he finds two more (Brenda Vaccaro and Talia Shire). After he completes the kitchen with another of his mother’s friends (Susan Sarandon), they go to work.The beats that make up the renovation and opening of a restaurant are what we have mostly come to expect from watching easily consumed reality television and there’s an obvious, hard-to-resist pull to watching it all come together. While director Stephen Chbosky might have tripped up with his execrable adaptation of the cursed musical Dear Evan Hansen, he showed in The Perks of Being a Wallflower and Wonder that he understands how to deal with the often exaggerated rhythms of feelgood fare such as this. It’s a plainly sentimental movie but it’s never a cloying one, Liz Maccie’s script also guiding us toward big emotions in a way that doesn’t force us to feel. It’s surprising how delicate some of the moments end up playing despite the territory.These moments come not just from Vaughn feeling the presence of family once again but also from these four older women being given the opportunity to feel useful and active again. The post-Book Club stream of films giving women over the age of 60 lead roles again has been mostly a bust, wasting actors such as Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Jacki Weaver, Sally Field and Sarandon herself in silly slop that they should have the choice and freedom to turn down. Nonnas offers these women something far less patronising and mostly less juvenile (for once, no accidentally-does-drugs-at-awkward-moment sequence – hurrah – although some slapstick kitchen sparring wears a little thin) and while more depth could inevitably be afforded to each character (a scene of the quartet getting tipsy on limoncello while sharing their regrets is so effective that we crave more), there’s something unusually more human about how the women are treated. We’re used to seeing Sarandon giving us her best (although she’s far better suited to playing the glamorous pastry chef here than she was as Crazy Cat Lady in The Fabulous Four) but reuniting us with Shire, Bracco and Vaccaro feels like a treat, actors who haven’t had quite the same boost from the slight uptick in older women on screen, old friends rejoining us at the table.While I wasn’t expecting it to come near the unreachably high bar set by the recent cookery classic The Taste of Things, I could have done with perhaps a little more of the process of preparing the dishes. There’s just about enough of the sensual pleasures of food to make us hungry but not quite as much detail as I would have liked. Most importantly though, Chbosky makes us genuinely care what happens to the business as the last act comes around because as formulaic as the film might be, there’s a refreshing lack of unnecessary added conflict. It remains grounded and focused (and one would imagine, mostly true to life) and so when the wins come, they’re far easier to cheer for. Nonnas has a straightforward sincerity that makes it go down easily.Nonnas is now available on Netflix",

            "content": "Mexico has sued Google for changing the Gulf of Mexico’s name to “Gulf of America” for Google Maps users in the United States, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said on Friday.“The lawsuit has already been filed,” Sheinbaum said at her morning news conference, without saying where and when it was submitted.On Thursday, Republicans in the House of Representatives approved legislation to codify Donald Trump’s policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”.The measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene and passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of vulnerable Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favor.The bill would make the name change official for federal agencies, but it’s unlikely to attract the Democratic support needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, other countries have no obligation to use the new name.Sheinbaum had warned Google, which is part of tech giant Alphabet, in February that she was considering legal action unless the company reversed its decision.Her government argues that Trump’s executive order on the subject only applies to the part of the continental shelf belonging to the United States.“All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,” Sheinbaum said.“The US government only calls the portion of the US continental shelf the Gulf of America, not the entire gulf, because it wouldn’t have the authority to name the entire gulf,” she added.In response to Trump, Sheinbaum has cheekily suggested calling the United States “América Mexicana” – Mexican America, pointing to a map dating back to before 1848, when one-third of her country was seized by the United States.The neighboring countries are in talks to defuse tensions over Trump’s global trade war, which has included a series of tariff announcements targeting Mexico.With reporting by Agence France-Press",

            "content": "The England and Wales Cricket Board is open to hosting the remainder of the Indian Premier League in September after escalating cross-border tension between India and Pakistan prompted the suspension of the world’s most lucrative Twenty20 tournament on Friday.In a chaotic 24 hours matches in both the IPL and the Pakistan Super League were cancelled or abandoned, schedules torn up and foreign players told to start packing and book flights home. The Pakistan Cricket Board announced that the last eight fixtures of its tournament were being relocated to the United Arab Emirates, only for the Emirates Cricket Board apparently to reconsider its decision to host because it was “wary of being perceived as an ally of the PCB”, leading to that tournament also being suspended.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has so far confirmed only that the IPL has been paused for a week. But with 16 games remaining and overseas players now in the process of flying respective home, its resumption is shrouded in doubt.The Guardian understands that Richard Gould, the ECB’s chief executive, has already reached out to his equivalents at the BCCI offering his support. Should India be unable to restart the IPL after this week-long hiatus, one suggestion is for England to host the remaining fixtures later in the year.A senior ECB source has confirmed this could be possible in September, albeit adding that no “active discussions” are currently taking place. A similar offer from English cricket came in 2021 when the IPL was paused by the Covid-19 pandemic, though the UAE eventually served as stand-in hosts.The decision to halt the IPL followed the abandonment of Thursday’s fixture between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala midway through its first innings after a military base in Pathankot, about 80km away, was targeted by what Indian officials described as “missiles and drones”. Floodlights were turned off and fans asked to leave while the players and staff of the two teams were rushed away from the ground, some still wearing their pads. Dharamsala is one of 27 Indian airports now closed because of security concerns, forcing the teams to stay until Friday morning before travelling to Delhi by train.“Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” Devajit Saikia, the BCCI secretary, said in a statement, adding the decision had been taken “following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans”.With 58 games played and 12 group-stage fixtures remaining, plus four playoff ties, the BCCI must now decide if and how to complete the competition. IPL seasons have been fully or partially relocated on four previous occasions: in 2009 it was played in South Africa because of a clash with Indian elections; in 2014 a similar issue meant the first 20 matches were played in the UAE; in 2020 Indian lockdown rules pushed it back to the UAE and in 2021 the second half of the tournament was also played there, again because of Covid.The option of relocating to the UAE appeared to be off the table following the PCB’s announcement that its tournament was to conclude there. The PSL’s suspension came after Thursday’s match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings was postponed amid claims that an Indian drone missile had damaged the area around the stadium in Rawalpindi where it was to be played, an attack that was described by Mohsin Naqvi, chair of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), as “extremely irresponsible” and “reckless”.Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotionBut on Friday night the Indian news agency PTI reported the Emirates Cricket Board had decided not to endanger local security, or its relationship with the BCCI, by appearing to favour Pakistan. “The UAE has a diverse South Asian population which enjoys cricket. Hosting a tournament like the PSL in the midst of such tense circumstances could vitiate harmony, pose security risks and stir unnecessary friction between communities,” a source told PTI.Hours after the PCB announced that the tournament would move to the UAE it released a fresh statement saying that following advice from the country’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, it would instead be paused. “National attention and sentiments are rightly focused on the courageous efforts of the armed forces who are vociferously upholding the sovereignty of our beloved Pakistan,” it wrote. “We also have sincere regard for the mental wellbeing of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign playersand wWe respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home.”Seven English players are involved in the PSL and 10 in the IPL, all of whom are expected to return home over the weekend.",

            "content": "“Most black people went overboard and tried hard to make sure that they did their best for Britain,” says Prince Albert Jacob, a 99-year-old veteran from Trinidad who joined the RAF in 1943.In a London hotel lobby, after a busy week of VE Day celebrations, Jacob describes feeling disappointed at findings from a recent survey that showed British people remained largely unaware of the black and Asian contribution to the second world war.“That was my experience. Most of us tried our best to do our best for the country. I don’t want to upset anyone, but I think it shows ignorance. How can you not know? Especially today with what’s going on in this world,” he says.Jacob, who grew up in Port of Spain, Trinidad, left life as he knew at 17 to join the Royal Air Force, travelling to the US and Britain to repair planes. He still remembers the day the allies formally accepted Germany’s surrender in 1945.“I was stationed in Carlisle at the time,” says Jacob. “It was a shock. I wouldn’t say you couldn’t believe it, but it was a shock. It was a fantastic experience in the sense the first thing that comes to mind is going home. I’m going where it’s warm again.”After the war, Jacob went on to represent the GB team in running, before establishing a 30-year career as postmaster of Acocks Green post office in Birmingham.For 80 years, however, missing from his jackets were the war medals he was told he would receive. Jacob was unaware at the time that you had to apply for the medals to receive them. That all changed two years ago when he got talking to a neighbour.“We had [Jacob and his wife] been living in Knowle for nearly 50 years and one day, one of my neighbours mentioned to me about the Royal Air Force. I told her that I used to be in the air force during the war and she couldn’t believe it. I gave her my details and she got in touch with the military about my medals.”His face beams as he remembers the day the war medal, defence medal and a veteran’s badge arrived in the post. “I never want to take them off. Is it the right thing or the wrong thing? I don’t know. I’m just thankful that people realise the contribution and appreciate what we did,” says Jacob.Sign up to Headlines UKGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningafter newsletter promotionOn receiving the medals, the veteran was quickly thrown into the spotlight. The organisation Why Are West Indians, which works to promote 500 years of Caribbean contribution to British heritage, got in contact with Jacob to share his story.Reflecting on his experience in the war, Jacob remembers various instances where he experienced racism. Yet that did not take away away from what he describes as a thrilling period of his life. “Parts of it were definitely exciting. Part of it was new experience. We got to attend lots of dances. We definitely knew more about the English than the English knew about us.”The best day of his life, however, came two months before his 100th birthday. To round off a week of VE celebrations, Jacob found himself sat one row behind the king at Horse Guards Parade on Thursday.“I had the opportunity of the king shaking my hand and wishing me well,” he said. “It’s a dream, I’m in heaven. It’s something I will never forget – the most exciting day of my life, I would say.”Celebrating VE Day will always remain important for Jacob. “Its a chance to appreciate those [who fought in the war] that are still alive. For those who have left us, we can’t thank them but we can remember them for what they have done.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 17:32",
            "content": "Donald Trump wanted Thursday, like every day, to be all about him. He thought the news cycle would be dominated by his sealing of the first US trade deal since he blew a hole in the world economy with the dynamite of tariffs. He gathered his vice-president and several cabinet members in the Oval Office to announce the new agreement – with the UK, as it happens – only for the gaze of the world to be diverted. All eyes were on Rome, where Trump was upstaged by one of the few global players who can outdo him when it comes to putting on a show.Don’t think Trump is not simultaneously wondering how he can use that whole white-smoke thing – perhaps to signal his winning of a constitutionally prohibited third term in 2028 – and worrying that Leo XIV is a serious rival for the commodity he craves more than any other: attention. There now lives an American with more global followers than he has, and it happened in an instant.None of this will concern the other party to the outline agreement unveiled in the White House. For Keir Starmer, this is a welcome fillip. A week ago, he was reeling from sweeping electoral losses to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party. Seven days later, he can toast trade deals with both the US and India, as well as a timely gift from the Bank of England, in the form of a cut in interest rates.The mere fact of getting those agreements done is an achievement. Griping from the Conservatives and their press allies is laughable: this was precisely the prize the Brexiters promised, sought and failed to deliver. Had a Tory prime minister pulled it off, they would be hailing it as the dawn of a new golden age.Even the nature of the agreement can be cast as a win for Starmer – and yet more proof that Trump, the self-proclaimed maestro of the deal, is, in fact, a terrible negotiator. Panicked by the crisis his tariffs have created – pushing up prices, slowing the US economy and alarming the stock and bond markets – the US president has been craving anything that can be cast as a breakthrough. As Paul Ashworth, economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to investors: “This rush to demonstrate progress on ‘deals’ reveals a rising desperation within the administration to roll back tariffs before they hit GDP growth and inflation.”The result is that Trump ceded to Starmer most of what Britain wanted, while accepting the mere promise of later discussion on the things the US sought in return. Duties on Range Rovers and Aston Martins sold to the US will now fall from 27.5% to 10%, while levies on imported British steel fall to zero. Yes, UK barriers to US beef and ethanol imports are lowered, but Trump’s bigger demands – above all, for a cut in the digital service tax that Britain slaps on the US tech giants – have been kicked into the long grass of potentially endless negotiation. The UK gets the gain now, with the pain delayed. For the US, it’s not far off the other way around.What’s more, Starmer held to his red line on food imports. Any wobbling on that could have doubly cost him, first by angering UK consumers with the prospect of supermarket shelves brimming with US chlorinated chicken and, second, by jeopardising the trade in food with the EU. Even after this deal with Trump, the UK and EU markets remain compatible.All told, along with the agreement struck with India, the week could almost be a showcase for Starmerism: the steady, unflashy grinding out of incremental progress. It may not be the buccaneering, globe-bestriding future promised by Boris Johnson and the leave crowd. That was always a delusion. But it’s something, and a demonstration of what the Europe minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, calls the “ruthless pragmatism” that may well define Starmer.Even so, we should not get carried away. As Ashworth advised his clients: “The ‘full and comprehensive’ trade deal between the US and the UK announced in a rush today ... is no such thing.” Trade expert David Henig says that the stats Trump trumpeted on Thursday were “mostly invented” and that the likely gains for the UK will be “microscopic”, compared with the 4% of GDP lost through Brexit. To state the obvious, getting a tariff down to 10% still leaves in place a tariff that was not there a matter of weeks ago. Henig gives credit to the government for getting something across the line, noting that Starmer has secured for Britain terms as good as anyone else has got. But, he told me, what has been done is essentially a “nothing burger”, with “incredibly modest” benefits.And a reminder: this is Donald Trump we’re talking about. There is no guarantee he will stick to this framework of an agreement, any more than he keeps his word on anything else. Trump has spoken warmly of the art of renegotiation. That prospect is especially tempting when the party across the table seems happy: if they feel like winners, in his mind that makes him a loser. Not for nothing do plenty of trade analysts counsel that the UK’s best hope now is that Trump’s focus shifts to other countries, with phase two of US-UK talks indefinitely postponed.Here it’s instructive to learn the lesson of the major US universities, on whom Trump has declared war, slashing their funding and seeking to control their teaching. Facing the loss of $400m, Columbia tried to be emollient and accommodate Trump’s demands. He just came back for more.Harvard took a different approach, refusing to accept government intrusion and suing the administration over threats to its funding. Within hours, more than 150 other colleges joined together to denounce Trump, uniting to prevent an “unprecedented” attack on their independence. Before long, the White House was spluttering that the list of demands issued to Harvard had been sent by mistake.These, then, are the two strategies available when the Trump juggernaut comes for you. You can seek to cut a separate deal, to protect yourself, as Columbia tried to do. Or you can stand together with all those similarly under attack, seeking to repel the entire Trump offensive, which is what happened after Harvard made its move. So far it is collective action that has got the best results.Applied to world trade, that would mean a shift away from the every-man-for-himself approach that led to Thursday’s handshakes in the Oval Office, and towards a combined endeavour in which the UK joins forces with, say, Canada and Australia and, obviously, its nearest and biggest trading partner, the EU, to oppose Trump and his prosperity-destroying, self-harming tariffs. More Harvard, less Columbia.Now, clearly, Starmer’s duty is to protect Britain from a US currently wrecking the global trading system. He took a step in that direction this week. But the greater, more lasting protection will surely come only when the free nations of the world don’t merely try to save their own skins, but instead come together to resist an American president bent on destroying so much that we all value – and not only on trade. Who knows, there may even be another American leader anointed this very week who would give such an effort his blessing.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist",

            "content": "Denmark’s former world champion Mads Pedersen edged out Wout van Aert in a bunch sprint to win the opening stage of the Giro d’Italia in Tirana, but Mikel Landa was forced to abandon the race after a crash five kilometres from the finish.Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) was positioned perfectly by his teammates for the climax in the Albanian capital and held off Belgium’s Van Aert to become the first rider this year – and the first Dane – to wear the overall leader’s pink jersey. Venezuela’s Orluis Aular (Movistar) was third across the line.“To win the stage and go into the pink jersey is absolutely amazing, especially after teamwork like this,” said Pedersen, who won the world road title in England in 2019.“You always have to be afraid of Wout, he’s a really good bike rider. It’s not a given to win when he’s in the group, and you have to handle that with respect and a bit of fear as well. But today I had the legs to finish it off for the team.”Van Aert was left frustrated that he could not mark his Giro d’Italia debut by winning the first stage. “There are only a few opportunities to take the pink jersey. So that’s why I really wanted to try – on the last climb, I suffered so much to just hang on,” he said. “So it’s a pity to finish second, but it’s still better than expected.”Landa, a three-time stage winner in the Giro who came third overall in 2015 and 2022, crashed on the outskirts of Tirana as the peloton wound up the pace towards the finish. The 35-year-old Soudal Quick-Step rider was taken from the course on a stretcher.“Our rider has been taken to the hospital for investigations after the crash that put an end to his dreams at the Giro,” said his team on X.His crash was among several on the opening day, with Juan Ayuso of UAE Team Emirates, one of the leading contenders for the race, crashing early at a roundabout. The Spaniard was unhurt and finished safely in the pack alongside the race favourite, Primoz Roglic.Two other riders expected to challenge for the maglia rosa – Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) and Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) – lost time on a punishing day.

            "content": "Part of a Soviet spacecraft is expected to crash back down to Earth this weekend, with experts still unsure of where it will land.Kosmos 482 was launched in March 1972 on a Soyuz rocket a few days after the Venera 8 atmospheric probe, and was thought to have a similar purpose. Intended to reach Venus, it failed to escape low Earth orbit and instead broke into four pieces.Now, Kosmos 482’s lander probe is expected to come down to Earth with a bump. Marek Ziebart, professor of space geodesy at University College London, said the situation was unusual, noting de-orbited satellites tended to burn up in the planet’s atmosphere owing to drag.However, that is unlikely to be the case for Kosmos 482 – a spacecraft that was designed to withstand Venus’s extreme conditions, such as its acidic atmosphere and extreme heat. “Anything we try to send Venus has to be armour plated,” said Ziebart.As a result, the lander probe is expected to be robust enough to pass through the Earth’s atmosphere. “Because this thing is basically 500kg, and it’s only about a metre across, then it will probably survive,” he added.It is not the first part of Kosmos 482 to do so: some components landed in New Zealand soon after the launch. According to Nasa, the lander probe contained a heat shield and a parachute to help it land. However, experts said these may have been compromised over time.While the altitude of Kosmos 482 has gradually decreased, quite when it will crash to Earth remains unclear. Nasa said it was expected to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere some time from 9 to 10 May.The location of where it will crash remains a mystery. At present, Nasa said it thought the landing probe could end up anywhere between the latitudes of 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south – a broad band that includes parts of Europe, the UK and the Americas as well as Africa and Australia, among other countries and regions. “It’s not going to end up de-orbiting at the poles,” said Ziebart.While Nasa said the time and location at which it would re-enter Earth’s atmosphere should be known more accurately over the next day or so, uncertainty would be significant right up to re-entry.“Because this is uncontrolled, that is the important thing here, we can’t do anything to influence where it comes down, but we can track it with telescopes and with radar,” said Ziebart, although he noted that depended on the area in question having sufficient radar coverage.He added that with the lander probe not only heavy but likely to be travelling at speed, “it would have some destructive capability”.But while the probe could hit a populated area, Ziebert said as water covered about 72% of the Earth’s surface, “it’s more than likely going to hit water”.",

            "content": "Twelve years ago, in the words of the late Pope Francis, the Catholic church went “to the ends of the Earth” in its search for a new pontiff. On Thursday, after surprisingly brisk discussions, the most geographically diverse conclave in history went to the heart of a superpower to find his successor.The election of the first American pope is a remarkable moment. In part the cardinals’ choice of the Chicago-born Robert Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV, can be seen as a robust progressive response to the signs of the times. While senior Catholic figures around Donald Trump prosecute an insular Maga agenda, the new pope is as at home in Latin America, having spent two decades working in one of the poorest regions of Peru. Previous posts on a social media account under his name suggest he shared Francis’s withering views on the Trump administration’s draconian immigration policies.In an era when the rise of nationalism risks undermining global responses to challenges such as migration and the climate emergency, the cardinals have chosen a pope who can, like Francis, act as a countervailing force. In choosing his papal name, Cardinal Prevost signalled an affinity with another forerunner, Leo XIII, who made social justice a key Catholic priority at the end of the 19th century. That such a voice should speak with an American accent, in the age of Trump, will send its own powerful and vital message to the world.Within the church itself, traditionalist hopes of a post-Francis return to a more doctrinally rigid, hierarchical way of doing things appear to have been scotched. Though more moderate and diplomatic in manner, the new pontiff seems likely to stick to the reforming direction of travel set by his predecessor. In his previous job as head of the Vatican’s department for choosing bishops, Cardinal Prevost echoed Francis’s calls for clerical humility, observing that “the bishop is not supposed to be a little prince sitting in his kingdom”. Similarly, the deliberately inclusive language of his Thursday evening address in St Peter’s Square suggested that he will continue Francis’s “synodal” mission to open up ecclesiastical structures to greater lay influence.For women in the church, that will hopefully mean a further rise in influence after the incremental gains of the last papacy. But amid ongoing divisions, there will be battles to come. As frustration mounts over the seemingly immovable veto on women’s ordination, Pope Leo is likely to find himself under pressure to speed up what he has described as the “slow process” of expanding female roles. And although he has expressed support for same-sex blessings, past denunciations of ‘“gender ideology” will generate unease among those won over by the warmth of Francis’s inclusive approach to LGBTQ+ people.For progressive Catholics, how far and how fast Pope Leo is prepared to move on such matters – and on toughening up procedures for dealing with clerical sexual abuse – will be crucial. But despite fears that this conclave could take its own Trumpian turn and choose an inward-looking arch-conservative as the 267th pope, it opted instead for broad continuity with the compassionate, world-facing spirit of Francis’s groundbreaking papacy. For a world increasingly riven by great-power rivalry, and scarred by war and inequality, that is very welcome news.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "Barbieland, the Emerald City and a galaxy far, far away were all built – at least in part – at film studios just outside London. Now the UK film industry has come crashing down to earth with Donald Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on all movies “produced in foreign lands”. “Hollywood is being destroyed,” Mr Trump announced, like an action hero on a mission. “Other nations have stolen our movie industry.” In the UK the news was met with warnings that the British film sector would be “wiped out” by such a “knock-out blow”. Brian Cox, the Succession star, called the proposed tariffs “an absolute disaster”. Roll the opening credits.Mr Trump has a point. New instalments of Marvel’s Avengers and Spider-Man are filming around London this summer. No wonder the president wants “MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” The UK’s generous tax incentives, skills base and state-of-the-art facilities have helped make it “the Hollywood of Europe”. Now it is under threat. Without these blockbusters, Britain would be left with more than a superhero deficit.Like the British TV industry, UK film is already in a precarious state. Covid, the US screenwriters’ and actors’ strike, streaming platforms, a reduction in public spending alongside rising production costs, not to mention the dangers of AI, have all taken their toll.It hasn’t been entirely bad news: on the face of it, film-making is flourishing. Since 2019, stage space in the UK has doubled, with expansions at Leavesden and Pinewood, alongside the creation of a new studio in Liverpool. If Trump’s tariffs go ahead, and if they are extended to include TV production, these vast buildings could be left empty.The biggest impact would be on the nearly 200,000 people who work in film and TV. According to one chief executive, without American movies the thousands of freelancers on which the sector depends would be “jobless”.Today’s film industry is a complex and globalised one, albeit one in which the US retains much power. Determining the nationality of a film is a bit like asking which parts of a cow your hamburger comes from. Even quintessentially British franchises are usually co-productions with American companies: James Bond now reports to Amazon; Harry Potter is Warner Bros. This is not new: Mary Poppins floated into Cherry Tree Lane via Burbank, California. The Brooklyn scenes in Captain America were shot in Manchester. Last year, the French streaming company that owns the Paddington franchise promised not to change “this very British bear” to appeal to American audiences. “I’m a little bit of everything,” our bear observes at the end of Paddington in Peru.Film is at the heart of the UK’s cultural sector, soft power and identity. As Philippa Childs, head of the creative industries union Bectu, says: “It is a matter of essential national economic interest.” The greatest risk is that smaller movies might not be made at all. More than ever, help must be given to bolster Britain’s independent film industry.How – or even if – these levies will be imposed is far from clear. The government appears to be advising a policy of keep calm and carry on. Maybe Sir Keir Starmer could follow Mr Trump, who has appointed Sylvester Stallone, Mel Gibson and Jon Voight as screen tsars, by recruiting a trio of British film “special ambassadors” – Sir Michael Caine, Idris Elba and Dame Judi Dench, perhaps? M would surely have had something to say about relocating from Pinewood to Atlanta.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/09/nhs-england-chief-rules-out-big-rise-in-health-service-funding",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 17:25",
            "content": "Ministers have “maxed out” the amount of money they can give the NHS and it must learn to live with smaller annual budget rises, the health service’s new boss in England has said.The parlous state of the country’s finances means the government can no longer afford to hand the service big uplifts every year, despite the huge pressures it is under, Jim Mackey added.“We are pretty much maxed out on what’s affordable. It is really now about [the NHS] delivering better value for money, getting more change, delivering on getting back to reasonable productivity levels,” said Mackey, who replaced Amanda Pritchard last month.Speaking at an event in London on Thursday organised by the Medical Journalists’ Association (MJA), Mackey played down the prospect of the health service receiving significant extra cash in June’s comprehensive spending review.Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will publish the review – setting out government spending between 2026-27 and 2029-30 – on 11 June. In her first budget last October she gave the NHS in England an extra £22bn for 2024-25 and 2025-26.Warning of tough choices ahead for the NHS, Mackey added: “In the end, it will be about how we get better value for money for the money that we’ve got. And we’ll get some growth in the spending review, but it’s never enough.”The Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, which is close to Labour, said Mackey’s remarks showed that England’s 215 care trusts were facing a “painful new reality”.Sebastian Rees, the IPPR’s head of health, said: “Clearly, the very difficult state of the public finances confronting the government mean the days of the NHS getting almost automatic significant increases in its budget every year are over, for now at least.“Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting just do not have the financial flexibility to give the NHS the 6% and 7% annual rises it got under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.”But Rees added: “Spending on high-quality NHS services is ultimately an investment in the health and prosperity of the nation. We know that solving many of the Treasury’s fiscal woes, such as tackling economic inactivity and reducing the social security bill, will require spending  more on healthcare, not less.”Mackey’s remarks come as the government is drawing up its promised 10-year health plan. The document is being put together by a team of advisers to Streeting, the health secretary, and is expected to be published in early July, close to the 77th anniversary of the creation of the NHS in 1948 by the post-second world war Labour government.Mackey also defended budget cuts that trusts are making this year, which senior figures warned on Friday were “eye-watering” and would lead to service closures and cuts to staffing. They are the result of a brutal “financial reset” for the service that he ordered in March.Without such tough action the NHS was on course to overspend by £6.6bn this year, despite its budget being about £200bn, Mackey told the MJA. “[There was] the shock that that was creating [in Whitehall], the worry that was creating, [and] the anxiety about what that meant for the economy, and [with] the international instability that we’ve got, what it meant for broader society.”He also warned NHS leaders that, while he understood their concerns about having to operate within financial restraints, the huge fall in public satisfaction with the service over recent years should be their main concern. Only 21% of people are satisfied with the NHS, the latest British Social Attitudes survey revealed last month.Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionMackey added: “The thing we should all really bother about is the British Social Attitudes survey in all of this. It was really terrible last year [when satisfaction was 23%]. We all thought we’d bottomed out, and then it got worse in the latest one. So that was a really big shock; a really big sign that we’re in danger of losing that connection with the public. [That] we’ll lose that properly. We are in really serious trouble.”The Department of Health and Social Care endorsed the chief executive’s views on funding. “The stark financial reality outlined by Jim Mackey reflects the scale of the challenge we inherited,” a spokesperson said. “The prime minister and secretary of state have been clear that the NHS must reform to deliver better value for taxpayers’ money.”In January Streeting criticised  what he called the NHS’s “culture of routine overspending without consequences”. The service had to “learn to live within its means”, he told the Health Service Journal.In other remarks to the MJA, in his first public appearance since starting his role, Mackey:Promised to tackle “completely unacceptable” variation in the quality of care patients receive, depending on which part of the NHS treats them.Voiced alarm that situations that previously would not have been tolerated, such as “old ladies being on corridors next to an emergency department for hours on end”, have become “normalised”.Said ministers had come to see the existence and independence of NHS England as “a complication”, because of “tension” and “frustration” over not being able to order it to do what they wanted, before they decided to abolish it.",

            "content": "The University of North Carolina on Friday denied reports that Jordon Hudson, the girlfriend of head football coach Bill Belichick, has been banned from its football facilities.“While Jordon Hudson is not an employee at the University or Carolina Athletics, she is welcome to the Carolina Football facilities,” an athletic department spokesperson said in a statement. “Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick’s personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University.”The statement was released hours after journalist Pablo Torre reported on his podcast that Hudson had been barred from UNC’s football operations. Torre cited 11 sources, including two who claimed Hudson was specifically told she was “no longer allowed in the football building”.Torre stood by his reporting, posting on X that the information “came from the highest levels of the football program” and criticizing UNC for not fulfilling Freedom of Information Act requests related to Hudson’s involvement. “UNC can now choose to describe or change its position on Jordon Hudson’s involvement however it wishes, following the publication of our episode,” Torre wrote.P.S. UNC can now choose to describe or change its position on Jordon Hudson’s involvement however it wishes, following the publication of our episode. We requested comment and filed dozens of FOIA requests that were not satisfied. And we stand by the specific reporting in our… https://t.co/O9rZSPW5K3Hudson, 24, has been a prominent figure around Belichick since his arrival at UNC last December. The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach, who was fired by the New England Patriots following a 4-13 season in 2023, took over the Tar Heels’ program on a $10m annual salary, making him the highest-paid public employee in North Carolina.Hudson’s influence on Belichick’s media presence became a flashpoint during an April interview with CBS Sunday Morning. While promoting his new book, The Art of Winning, Belichick was asked about how he and Hudson met. Hudson, off-camera, interjected, saying, “We’re not talking about that.”Belichick later accused CBS of breaking an agreement to keep the interview focused on football, stating, “Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview.” He defended Hudson’s intervention, saying she “stepped in to help refocus the discussion”.Hudson is scheduled to compete in the Miss Maine pageant this weekend. She and Belichick began dating in 2023 after reportedly meeting on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. Hudson has since played a role in Belichick’s branding efforts, including stints with ESPN and Underdog Fantasy during his year away from coaching.Her involvement has drawn scrutiny at UNC and beyond. Last month, the university reportedly ended discussions with NFL Films about featuring the Tar Heels on Hard Knocks, with sources indicating Hudson’s influence was a factor.",

            "content": "I’m so pleased that paternity leave is getting some air time and there is a campaign to increase it (The Guardian view on paternity leave: campaigners are right to demand more, 5 May). Probably in part because I follow the Pregnant Then Screwed campaigns, my husband and I have discussed this in depth. He is now due to be taking a full six months of shared parental leave from his workplace this year.With our first baby, he was at home but working self‑employed, so had no benefits. I suffered with postnatal depression, and struggled with breastfeeding and the anxiety of trying to do it all right.This time, we are so looking forward to having six months off together as a family. My husband will be able to bond with the baby and be the supportive father to our toddler, with no mental pressure to have to be doing something else. It’s going to be so different!We know we are the outliers – none of our friends have done this or seem inclined to. A big part is the women still want 12 months and worry that they have to go back early if they share the time. The men also maybe haven’t understood all their rights.I will be taking 12 months, but it is a matter of juggling workplace policies and is not very easy to navigate. I just wanted to share that this is possible. You can have it all. You can take 12 months as the woman, and you can have your partner with you for longer than two weeks. And it could be wonderful for you both.Leila FroudBath I’m so very sorry to hear that fathers are finding it unattractive to take two weeks of paternity leave when compensated at the statutory £187.18 a week. Do let me remind you that this is the same country which pays a woman a mere £6.38 an hour (six weeks of pay at 90% of her salary, which on average in the UK is roughly £700 a week, plus 33 weeks of maternity pay at that princely £187.18/week), half of the national minimum wage, for giving up her career for 39 weeks to instead work at delivering and nurturing a future taxpayer.This is not to mention the physical and emotional cost of working “as normal” through the previous 40 weeks of her pregnancy, the soft impact on her career of taking nine months of leave, and the financial cost to the family of putting that child into nursery at eight or nine months old so the mother can return to her £700-a-week job. And this is before we factor in the weeks of unpaid leave or holiday she will take to cover illnesses, and the impact on her career of needing the flexibility to work around inflexible nursery hours.Perhaps if we paid women properly for their labour, men would find it easier to sacrifice their full earnings for two short weeks in order to become more fully engaged parents.Alison SmithLondon I read your article on the proposed “dad strike” regarding the pathetic paternity entitlement in the UK while visiting my son, partner and kids in Oslo (British men urged to join ‘Dad strike’ calling for more paternity leave, 1 May). My son is on four months’ paid paternity leave and his partner has recently returned to work after eight months’ paid maternity leave. Yes, let me repeat, four months, paid.On taking one of my grandchildren to the barnehage (nursery), I am struck by the number of young men having responsibility for their young kids. This is how it should be. It’s really wonderful and it also enables many women to work full time.The Labour government is clearly unpopular, as confirmed by the local elections, and a second term is unlikely unless a radical change of direction occurs. This should include significant improvements in paternity rights.Jol MiskinSheffield Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

            "content": "Re your editorial (The Guardian view on Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza: hunger as a weapon of war, 4 May), what we are witnessing in Gaza is the collective punishment of a civilian population, mostly refugees, who were already living in highly vulnerable conditions following 18 months of what the international court of justice found to be a plausible risk of genocide and 18 years of an Israeli blockade.That blockade has been tightened further for the past two months, during which hunger has been weaponised, with the apparent aim of ethnically cleansing Gaza. The author Omar El Akkad describes the term “genocide” as a “mechanic of forewarning”, not some “after‑the-fact resolution”. The world should consider itself warned that the genocide in Gaza has entered a new phase of mass starvation with hunger, thirst and disease stalking 2 million people.The path to de-escalation lies in implementing the second phase of the ceasefire abandoned by Israel on 18 March. Israel has instead threatened to intensify its operations in Gaza, which will be catastrophic for Palestinians with two-thirds of Gaza already designated as either “no-go areas” or “under active displacement orders”. Only external pressure on Israel and the governments complicit in its occupation will prevent this outrage.The American academic activist Angela Davis has described Palestine as “a moral litmus test for the world” and we as citizens need to act accordingly.Stephen McCloskeyDirector, Centre for Global Education, Belfast So much about the situation in Gaza is “shameful” and, as your excellent editorial concludes, that it has “been allowed to happen” is most shameful of all. It is clearly the case that as long as Netanyahu goes unpunished by the world, he will carry on the genocide of Palestinians (Netanyahu says new offensive in Gaza focused on consolidating seizure of territory, 5 May).Sadly, the crisis for Palestinians in Gaza is one of the many things Keir Starmer doesn’t appear to “get”, but that doesn’t mean Labour MPs should show similar spinelessness: at the very least they should force an emergency debate and vote on action to be taken. Aren’t they ashamed to be abetting the slaughter with arms sales, ashamed that their government hasn’t demanded sanctions against Israelis similar to the ones imposed on Russia, and determined to steer a government that is lost in at least one right direction? Failing that, they should be forcing a leadership contest. Bernie EvansLiverpool Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

But GPs are also employers, and the vast majority of their expenses are on staff. They are not exempt from national insurance contribution rises, and in fact the recent increase in funding will just about cover the NIC increase – this is unfortunately a case of the government giving with one hand and taking with the other.Improved premises are absolutely essential, but they come with increased service charges for practices. These are not paid centrally, but out of the same budget that pays staff salaries and that ultimately provides appointments. The result is that shiny new buildings mean less money to provide appointments for patients rather than more.If we really want to increase the number of appointments, we need a really significant injection of money into frontline general practice to cover these hidden increases in expenses.Funding has fallen so much over the last 10 years, but a big increase is what is required if we are to create a health service that functions well and efficiently. GPs desperately want to do more and see more patients (this is why we trained for all those years), but our hands are tied if we don’t have sufficient funds to provide these services.Name and address supplied Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

            "content": "Joe Louis Walker was a remarkable singer, guitarist and songwriter, but above all he was a serious bluesman. If you were looking for a lively blues night out, Walker would not have been your best bet. From the first, he stood out as a composer of ingenious, intelligent songs, which he made sound blue regardless of their musical form. His allegiance was to the inner character of the blues rather than to its external structure.The survival of the blues has always depended on its stock of known stories and familiar expressions. Walker, who has died aged 75, was deeply conscious of this tradition and drew on it with discrimination and skill, but often took the harder path of telling stories in freshly made language, his images drawn not from the ghost world of the blues’ past, but from life around him. “I swore I was gonna stay single – when I leave out and come back is up to me,” he sang in Personal Baby, “but I got to take a real good look at that Playboy philosophy.”He grew up in San Francisco, where his parents had moved from Arkansas, bringing with them a profound love of the blues. “My father would come home from work in construction and have his dinner and he’d have his record player right here. He’d put on Amos Milburn, Rosco Gordon, Howlin’ Wolf. And then, when he wasn’t playin’ it, my mother was – BB King, always BB King.”Hanging out with older teenagers who had bands, he picked up the elements of guitar. When he was about 20 he fell in with the guitarist Mike Bloomfield and some of his colleagues who had left Chicago for the west coast. He played with this band and that, and had the chance to open a concert for Fred McDowell and spend time absorbing the older man’s slide guitar playing. But the market for blues and R&B covers bands was overstocked, and in 1975 Walker jumped genre to play guitar for a gospel group, the Spiritual Corinthians.A decade on, he landed a place in the Mississippi Delta Blues Band, a group thrown together for a European tour. Back home, he pitched an audition tape to all the blues companies he knew of, and was signed by the Oakland label HighTone. Working with the production team of Bruce Bromberg and Dennis Walker – who had recently launched the recording career of Robert Cray – he achieved an impressive debut with Cold Is the Night (1986), its mostly original songs energised by spiky guitar. The album was voted the best blues recording of 1987 by the French Académie du Jazz, and its successors The Gift (1988) and Blue Soul (1989) helped Walker to winning contemporary artist of the year in the WC Handy blues awards three years running. Couched in more elaborate arrangements than its predecessors, Blue Soul set a standard by which his subsequent work would be measured.And there was a lot of it. Between frequent tours of the UK and mainland Europe, he made six albums in seven years from 1993 for Verve, among them Great Guitars, a conclave of blues guitarists including Steve Cropper, Robert Lockwood Jr and Otis Rush, and Silvertone Blues, which found him turning his gaze backwards and drawing inspiration from blues duos such as Muddy Waters and Little Walter, not recreating but reshaping them.That contract completed, he became a freelancing butterfly, flitting between labels including Telarc, Provogue and Stony Plain, but never, stylistically speaking, staying in one place long. He told me: “I don’t have this allegiance to Chicago blues – rah! rah! – or west coast blues – rah! rah! … Like my ex-ex-old lady said, I’m sort of all over the place … and it shows in my music.”Take Pasa Tiempo (2001), with its covers of Van Morrison and Otis Redding songs, and Latin-tinged jazz instrumentals: clever music, if somewhat impersonal. But in the same year’s Guitar Brothers, the tension is sometimes so tight it is painful, as he stared bleakly at the collapse of a relationship: “Our bodies, they live together, but our hearts, they live apart.” A newcomer to Walker’s work, hearing those two records in succession, might not have guessed they were by the same man.A bluesman so aware of the music’s history was obviously well suited to commemorative projects, and in the early 2000s Walker participated in tributes to Robert Johnson and Charley Patton, and contributed to albums celebrating the blues connections of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. Then, in 2012, he was signed by Alligator, the leading blues indie label – 26 years after it had turned him down. Of his three albums for the company, the most surprising was Journeys to the Heart of the Blues (2018). Turning his back on every prevailing blues fashion, Walker assembled a setlist of blues from the 1930s, 40s and 50s and arranged them for an acoustic trio: himself on guitar, the keyboardist Bruce Katz and the English harmonica player Giles Robson. It was as if men like Big Bill Broonzy had been brought back to life and given quality studio time. Nobody was better equipped for such affectionate and accurate reanimation than Walker.He is survived by his wife, Robin Poritzky-Walker, whom he married in 2009, two daughters from earlier relationships, Lena and Berniece, a sister, a brother, and two grandchildren. An earlier marriage ended in divorce. Joe Louis (Louis Joseph) Walker, born 25 December 1949; died 30 April 2025",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 17:17",
            "content": "Russian troops fighting in Ukraine have marched with Chinese forces on Moscow’s Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s defeat in a Victory Day celebration marked by greater spectacle than in recent years.After several scaled-back Victory Days – with reduced military displays and few foreign guests – Vladimir Putin on Friday addressed the largest parade since his 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.“The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,” the Russian president said of the victory over Nazi Germany, before turning to his invasion of Ukraine. “Truth and justice are on our side. The entire country, society and people support the participants of the special military operation,” Putin said, using the Kremlin’s preferred term to describe the war.While Putin was presiding over the parade, EU foreign ministers and Britain’s David Lammy travelled to Lviv in Ukraine where they announced the establishment of a tribunal for Russian war crimes. “Russia’s aggression cannot go unpunished and therefore establishing this tribunal is extremely important,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said during the visit.Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he expected European leaders to visit Kyiv on Saturday, while European allies said at a meeting in Oslo that they supported an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the war in Ukraine, something Moscow has been reluctant to agree to.Moscow welcomed at least 27 foreign heads to the annual military parade, the highest number since 2015, including the leaders of Brazil, Slovakia and Serbia. The Kremlin presented the turnout as proof that it is not isolated, even four years into its war in Ukraine.Other guests included leaders from fellow autocracies and pariah regimes, such as the military juntas from Myanmar and Burkina Faso.Putin also thanked a visiting North Korean military delegation – a sign of deepening ties and new geopolitical realities after recent admissions from both sides that North Korean troops have been fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine.Presiding over the parade, Putin sat beside the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and was seen in frequent conversation with his most powerful ally. The two men held extensive talks before the parade, and their joint statement went further than previous statements in directly condemning the US.The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was also in Moscow for the parade, and later on Friday met Putin. He criticised Donald Trump’s tariffs and pitched an expanded partnership with Moscow. “We have the chance at this historic moment to make our commercial relationship grow a lot,” he said.This year’s parade featured an expanded military presence, with a fleet of tanks rolling across Red Square alongside rocket launchers, TOS-2 Tosochka heavy flamethrower systems and Iskander ballistic missiles – all weapons used in the war in Ukraine. For the first time, several types of modern Russian-made drones were also on display, underscoring their role as a defining feature of the conflict.The showcase of weaponry marked a stark contrast to 2024’s toned-down parade, when a single Soviet-era tank rolled through Red Square. The shift is likely to resonate in European capitals, where officials have grown increasingly concerned about Moscow’s ability to replenish its military stockpiles and increase weapons production.Over his two-and-a-half decades in power, Victory Day has emerged as the centrepiece of Putin’s vision of Russian identity. But since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the Kremlin’s mass propaganda machine has given it new meaning, with Putin using the celebrations to justify the current war.Seated not far from Putin were several high-profile veterans of the war in Ukraine, while Russian media reported that more than 1,500 troops who took part in the invasion participated in the march.Putin has weaponised the legacy of the second world war to mobilise support for his invasion, falsely portraying Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, as a leader resurrecting nazism in Ukraine.Andrei Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based political analyst, said: “Victory Day is by far the most important celebration for Putin – it’s an ideological event designed to rally the nation around him. The central message to the public is that the current ‘special military operation’ is a logical continuation of the Great Patriotic War.”In a speech a day earlier, Zelenskyy condemned what he called Russia’s attempt to “appropriate Ukraine and distort history”, accusing the Kremlin of twisting the legacy of the second world war for propaganda purposes.“Tomorrow, the organiser of the mass graves in Bucha will speak of Nazi atrocities. The architects of the Mariupol siege will invoke the siege of Leningrad. It will be a parade of cynicism, bile, and lies,” Zelenskyy said.Despite the show of might on Red Square on Friday, there was widespread nervousness among Moscow’s political elite before the celebrations.At the end of April, Putin announced a three-day unilateral ceasefire in Ukraine, starting on 8 May to coincide with the commemorations. Zelenskyy dismissed the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless it was extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far rejected.In the lead-up to Victory Day, Ukraine significantly increased its drone attacks on Moscow and surrounding regions, causing airport closures and logistical chaos.Zelenskyy also warned that Ukraine would provide no security guarantees to foreign guests attending the parade in Moscow. As many observers had predicted, Kyiv appeared to refrain from targeting Moscow on the day of the parade, probably owing to the presence of high-profile international dignitaries.Still, fighting continued near the frontlines, with Moscow accusing Ukrainian forces of attempting to breach the border in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions.This year’s parade comes at what many see as a crossroads moment for Moscow, as the Trump administration steps up its efforts to persuade Putin to end the war. There appears to be a growing recognition in the White House that the Kremlin is not ready to back down from its maximalist demands, including territorial claims over parts of Ukraine it does not control.The US vice-president, JD Vance, echoed that frustration earlier this week, saying Russia was asking for “too much” in the talks, in the latest sign of Washington’s impatience with the negotiations.Britain, France and a group of north European nations met in Oslo to discuss a route to a lasting peace in Ukraine. The Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, said that during a dinner on Thursday the leaders had phone contact with Trump and Zelenskyy, and were pushing for a full ceasefire. “That needs to be monitored and respected before you can move into the negotiations on the big issues to reach a lasting peace,” he said.Kolesnikov said Putin appeared undecided about whether to enter into serious negotiations or continue the war in Ukraine, where Russian forces are making slow, grinding progress at a high human cost. “For now, he is stalling for time,” he said.",

            "content": "Supporters hoping to travel to the all-English Europa League final in Bilbao could end up paying thousands of pounds for the privilege. There are ways to drive that cost down, however, especially for those willing to spend two days on a ferry.After Tottenham and Manchester United confirmed their places at the San Mamés on 21 May via their respective semi-final second leg victories over Bodø/Glimt and Athletic Bilbao on Thursday, eyes immediately turned to the prospect of attending a game both Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim described as “massive”. Uefa has allocated 15,000 tickets to each club, with a further 11,000 tickets on general sale, out of a total capacity of 49,000. Tickets reserved for official allocations start at €40 (£34), the same price as last year, but general admission has risen in price, with the most expensive Category 1 ticket costing €240 (£203), up from €150 last year.United had already communicated their travel plans to supporters before the second leg against Athletic, with a 24-hour return trip to the Basque city costing £899 for those who secure a ticket in a lottery. Spurs, meanwhile, are set to confirm their official travel plans shortly.Fans planning to travel independently face pricing pinch points on tickets, travel and accommodation. With a number of general sale tickets expected to have been bought by Athletic fans, there is the prospect of a substantial resale market. Even though selling on is expressly prohibited by Uefa’s rules, second-hand ticket sites had prices starting from £950 on Friday. Hotel rooms, meanwhile, were in short supply, with Booking.com saying 97% of venues are already sold out, with its cheapest available offering for the night of the final starting at £1,300. Direct air travel for one person is coming in at around the same price.“Football fans are being exploited by airlines and hotels and Airbnb owners in the same way that people applying for Oasis tickets are when there’s surge pricing,” said Stephen Cavalier of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust. “Not all fans can afford to pay those sort of exorbitant prices and there are people going from a variety of different routes.”Both United’s and Spurs’ supporters trusts say fans are choosing to save money by flying indirectly to the venue, taking the train or driving down to the Basque Country. That return journey on the 48-hour ferry from Portsmouth to Bilbao, meanwhile, comes in at just under £400.According to Tom Hall, an editor and writer for Lonely Planet, being more imaginative in your travel plans might cost you time but will also save you money as well as lead to a more enjoyable experience. “If people are prepared to take on a bit of overland travel through Spain, they can have the most brilliant trip,” he said. “Flying into Barcelona, for example, means you’ve got the option to break the journey pretty much anywhere, which means you can box and cox on the cost.”He also recommends searching for rail-based options or driving down through France, with camper vans offering the possibility to save on accommodation too. “As a first choice look at overland options, consider driving and constructing a bit of a holiday out of it. I think all of those things are a ton of fun,” he said.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionHall does, however, warn against some of the more complicated flying options which involve changing flights in third countries. “You’re going a long way out your way,” he says, “and if something goes wrong with that then you’re in Istanbul and you’re not in Bilbao.”",

            "content": "John Textor is attempting an audacious takeover of Crystal Palace but faces competition from the New York Jets owner Woody Johnson as the battle for control at Selhurst Park heats up before the club’s appearance in the FA Cup final next Saturday.It is understood that Textor, who failed in his bid to buy Everton last year, has held talks with his fellow American shareholders David Blitzer and Josh Harris about buying their shares in Palace, which constitute about 36% of the club. That would take Textor’s stake to more than 80% and mean he would be able to complete a full takeover, a situation that could threaten the future of the long-serving chairman, Steve Parish.Parish and Textor fell out in 2023 when the American, who also owns the French club Lyon, the Brazilian side Botafogo and RWD Molenbeek in Belgium, increased his stake in Palace to 45%. It is understood they remain distant, with Parish believed to have held preliminary talks with Johnson about potentially buying out Textor and the other shareholders. The 78-year-old Johnson, who was the US ambassador to the UK, was seen with Parish at Palace’s game against Nottingham Forest on Monday.Parish owns just over 10% of the club he helped to save from administration in 2010 but effectively retains overall control. He is the executive chairman of the managing company that is in charge of Palace, with the four partners – Parish, Textor, Blitzer and Harris – having equal voting rights on the board but Parish has the casting vote.Textor previously signalled his intention to sell his stake in Palace after growing frustrated at his lack of influence in recruitment and other areas. In January he signed an exclusivity agreement with Sportsbank – a group of investors fronted by two Palace supporters – for it to invest in his company Eagle Football Holdings with a view to potentially taking his place on Palace’s board. But it is understood he would now prefer to push ahead with a takeover of the club where he is estimated to have invested about £150m since 2021.Harris and Blitzer, who bought their stake in 2015 and have portfolios of investments across a number of sports, are believed to be willing to sell owing to concerns about the ballooning costs of building a new main stand at Selhurst Park, which some sources are predicting could reach up to £240m. Palace remain committed to the project, which would increase the capacity to more than 34,000, and planning permission was granted in 2022, although work has yet to begin.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionDespite Palace’s success under their manager, Oliver Glasner, including reaching their third FA Cup final, it has been a turbulent few months behind the scenes. The highly regarded sporting director Dougie Freedman left to join the Saudi Arabian club Al-Diriyah in March and is believed to have been frustrated with having a limited budget during the January transfer window. The chief financial officer Sean O’Loughlin departed this week and the long-serving chief operating officer Sharon Lacey has joined the US club Fort Lauderdale United.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/09/mandelson-uk-ambassador-rides-crest-of-a-trade-deal",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 17:08",
            "content": "Peter Mandelson, with his elegant suits, smooth patter and high-end lifestyle, has always had a dark secret: an interest in the minutiae of trade deals, left over from his period as EU trade commissioner, a period when he could bore for Europe on the virtues of the Mercosur trade deal. Alongside his networking skills, and political antennae, it was his knowledge of trade that possibly persuaded Keir Starmer to take the political risk of appointing him ambassador to Washington.A pro-European social democrat with a full record of insulting remarks about Donald Trump’s racism, Lord Mandelson might not have been the obvious man to open previously closed doors in the US administration.So on Thursday in the White House Oval Office, as the US and UK announced the first trade deal of the post-“Liberation Day” era, Mandelson could be forgiven for feeling pleased with himself. For an hour, poker-faced, he stood to the left behind the president seated at his desk. On the right was the vice-president, JD Vance, alongside the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the US ambassador to the UK, Warren Stephens.Adopting 60 minutes’ worth of rapt poses, as he listened to Trump range across the waterfront and field media questions, he looked cast in the role of a fawning member of the Trump administration rather than an envoy from a foreign power.He smiled wanly as the president described Chuck Schumer as a Palestinian, but laughed when Trump complained the Democrats in Congress were blocking legislation only because they suffered from Trump derangement syndrome. “If they had some normal person, some stiff, sitting here they would be fine,” Trump said.Mandelson diplomatically praised Ambassador Stephens, a former banker, for getting the deal over the line, only for Trump to interject: “He has got plenty of cash,” prompting Mandelson to admit: “We need some big spenders.” When Trump extolled the virtues of the Rolls-Royce, the ambassador offered to sell him one “at a very modest discount”. Trump replied he had a Tesla.As a founder member of the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign, Mandelson looked suitably chastened when Trump praised Brexit as “a very smart decision”. The president said without Brexit they would not have been able to make a deal.Mandelson gave two brief panegyrics about the deal’s content. Aware that the small print is terra incognita to the president, Mandelson pitched his description of the deal at a high level, describing the deal as a movie and not a painting. Trump nodded approvingly, held the ambassador’s hand and told him what a beautiful accent he had, leading Mandelson to admit his mother would be proud.In what probably did not make great TV – the true yardstick for success in the Trump mindset – the president, struggling against sleep, listened to Starmer on speakerphone drawing a link between the lowering of tariffs on aluminium with how the UK and the US stood together in liberating Europe 80 years ago. The deal had been signed 80 years later almost to the hour, he said.But both sides probably knew this was a mutual rescue job. Starmer could claim the deal was the first signed since Trump – as the president himself described it – blew up the world trading system. It was proof of the endurance of the ailing special relationship, and a boon to the UK car industry. Trump, for his part, could finally show his tariff war was reaping results, and not just a stock market crash and plummeting polls. Lutnick duly ladled on the praise: “They thought it impossible until Donald Trump came along. We have the best dealmaker. He is the closer. He gets deals that no one else can.”The special relationship had got both sides out of a hole.For Trump what matters now is whether this deal can be an overture to the serious discussions ahead with China. With imports from China down by a fifth, he needed to show he can seal deals. For the UK and for Mandelson personally, it sets him up in Washington for the first time as a top player. More work will be done on the technology deal, and a lot of details were left incomplete. The truer test for Mandelson now is whether he can use the goodwill he has acquired in that one unique hour, and in the prior negotiations, to persuade Trump’s team to change course on the defence of Ukraine.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/09/scarlett-johansson-kristen-stewart-harris-dickinson-directorial-debuts-cannes",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 17:06",
            "content": "First-time directors with films premiering at Cannes next week would be forgiven for feeling nervous. But three of the directors who are unveiling their debut features in France are less likely than their peers to be quaking as they approach the red carpet.Actors Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and Harris Dickinson are all among the film-makers with movies screening in Cannes’ prestigious sidebar Un Certain Regard over the next 10 days.Now 35 and 40, Stewart and Johansson have had careers forged on the Croisette and have attended for many years. Stewart also served on the competition jury in 2018 while Johansson stars this year in a film in the main competition – Wes Anderson’s The Phoenician Scheme. Twenty-eight-year old Dickinson, meanwhile, made his critical breakthrough in Ruben Östlund’s Triangle of Sadness, which won the Palme d’Or in 2022, before finding worldwide fame opposite Nicole Kidman in Babygirl.Actors broadening their portfolio by dabbling in directing is nothing new, and Cannes has energetically indulged talents such as Sean Penn, Tommy Lee Jones and Clint Eastwood – as well as myriad domestic stars including Mathieu Amalric and Louis Garrell – who have attempted it.But the films of Stewart, Johansson and Dickinson are unusual in that none feature the famous name that is behind the camera in front of it. This may suggest financiers have been emboldened by the likes of Barbie director Greta Gerwig, who has resisted the temptation to do double duty on her own movies, with no noticeable impact on box office returns.In the cases of Johansson – one of Hollywood’s highest paid female actors – and Stewart, it is likely they would have had the resources to bypass conventional revenue streams and fund their own films. Dickinson’s debut, Urchin, is low budget and backed by BBC Films.Urchin stars Frank Dillane as a rough sleeper struggling with drug abuse, and was inspired by its writer-director’s experiences working at a shelter for homeless people in east London. “Around 2019-20 I was becoming disillusioned with politics and wanted to take action on a more local level,” says Dickinson. “So I began to lend a helping hand with very small localised things. It’s where I really started to understand how many people in that community were incredibly vulnerable and in need of support – let down by society and the system.”Dickinson’s cinematic heroes are Cannes darlings Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. “That’s been my bread and butter,” he says. “They’re incredibly political film-makers who hold a huge importance in film.”The Chronology of Water, Kristen Stewart’s adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir detailing multiple traumas, is also a passion project. Stewart first announced the movie, which stars Imogen Poots, in 2018, and became so disillusioned by the false starts that in January 2024 she declared: “I’m going to make this movie before I ever work for someone else. I will quit the fucking business. I won’t make a-fucking-nother movie until I make this movie. I will tell you that, for sure. I think that will get things going.”Six months later, she was shooting in Latvia. “Lidia’s memoir honours corporeal experience, radically,” Stewart has said. “To make that experience physical feels vital to me.”Sign up to Film WeeklyTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersafter newsletter promotionJohansson’s movie, Eleanor the Great, is perhaps the one with the strongest commercial prospects, having already sold to Sony Pictures and now drumming up Oscar buzz for its star, June Squibb, who plays an elderly woman who relocates from Florida to New York.“Premiering in Cannes, I don’t know how I will be able to process the hugeness of it,” said Johansson earlier this month. “It makes me nervous, but I’m excited as well.”She told a producing partner on the film: “If I do my job well and do what I’m supposed to do, I can imagine June walking the Croisette at age 95, starring in this incredible dramatic role.”Previous Un Certain Regard prizewinners include early works by Östlund, Yorgos Lanthimos and Sinners director Ryan Coogler. However, there are less happy precedents for actor-directors. In 2014, Ryan Gosling premiered his first film as director, Lost River, in the sidebar, fresh from high-profile Cannes smashes such as Drive and Only God Forgives. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw, one of the kinder critics at the time, called it “colossally indulgent, shapeless, often fantastically and unthinkingly offensive and at all times insufferably conceited”. Gosling has not directed since.",

            "content": "It’s time for another instalment of A Show for Every Streamer, where we recommend a TV series to watch on each of the approximately 3,082 streaming services currently vying for your limited recreational time. (You can read our previous attempts here and here). As ever, we’ve focused on series that haven’t been discussed endlessly – so no Adolescence or The White Lotus. Instead, you’ll find Danish flooding sagas, football-based gastronomy and Martin Clunes attempting a Welsh accent …Apple TV+ | Dope Thief\n The “Apple paradox”, where incredibly talented people combine to make shows that no one seems to watch, is alive and well here. Despite having Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura as leads and a pilot episode directed by Ridley Scott, this crime comedy-drama about two childhood friends who pose as drug agents to rob dealers seems to have had next to no cut-through. A shame, as it builds to a tense, dark and funny climax.BBC iPlayer | Families Like Ours\n  The title screams daytime soap, but this is actually something far more intriguing: a climate-change drama from Festen director Thomas Vinterberg. Families Like Ours imagines a Denmark where citizens have to evacuate the country due to flooding. It’s a terrifying prospect that Vinterberg handles with Dogme 95 levels of naturalism, finding small personal stories amid the creeping apocalypse.Channel 4 | GBH\n We’ve flagged a new C4 release in Take Five (see below) so instead here’s a word for its cavernous archive, which contains many of its most groundbreaking dramas over the decades: A Very British Coup, Queer as Folk, This is England and GBH, an ever-timely 1991 drama from Alan Bleasdale about city council corruption, featuring a ferocious performance from Robert Lindsay.Disney+ | Suspect: The Killing of Jean Charles de Menezes\n  The politically charged new series of Andor is Disney’s water-cooler show of the moment, but that has received props elsewhere. So instead let’s spotlight this four-part drama about the notorious 2005 police shooting from socially conscious TV king Jeff Pope. It’s a meticulously researched and utterly damning piece of procedural drama, with a cast that includes Russell Tovey, Conleth Hill and Emily Mortimer.Discovery+ | Adam Richman Eats Football\n  We could flag any number of grubby true-crime dramas here: Discovery churns them out at such a rate that you wonder if they may soon run out of murders to almost solve. But let’s sidestep the slaughter and instead flag this cheerful series, which sees Man v Food star Richman piggyback on the “footy scran” trend and try matchday delicacies across the UK, from pie and mash at West Ham to haggis and whiskey pizza at Celtic.ITVX | Out There “Martin Clunes plays a vigilante farmer taking aim at county lines drug runners” sounds like the sort of pitch you might get from a malfunctioning TV commissioning chatbot. But no, this revenge thriller is real and, more remarkably, Clunes – Mr Cosy Early-Evening Drama himself – is rather good in an uncharacteristic role, even if his west Walian accent is a bit off.My5 | The Good WifeAs you might expect from a platform with a strand titled Lawless Britain, Channel 5’s free streaming service largely trades in the trashy and prurient. But there are gems to be found if you look hard enough, such as all 156 episodes of the excellent Julianna Margulies led legal drama, which is also available to stream on Paramount+ too.Netflix | Turning Point: The Vietnam War\n It was only a matter of time that, having conquered the rest of TV, Netflix would come for Ken Burns’s turf. This five-part documentary from Brian Knappenberger (The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz) relitigates Vietnam, making use of talking heads on both sides of the conflict and sifting through hours of US presidents’ Oval Office meetings and phone calls, to argue that the war paved the way for a more cynical, distrustful America.NOW | The Righteous Gemstones\n Pour one out for Danny McBride’s comedy about a family of loathsome televangelists, which has just finished the fourth and final season of an impressively consistent run. In its latest outing, the show grows loopier and more ambitious, including a stand-alone episode set in the American civil war, and Bradley Cooper guest starring. As ever, it’s Walton Goggins – man of the hour due to The White Lotus – who steals the show.Paramount+ | Mobland\n A Guy Ritchie crime drama starring Tom Hardy, Pierce Brosnan and Helen Mirren? Frankly, we didn’t know Paramount+ had that level of clout, but here we are. Written and created by Ronan Bennett (with assistance from Jez Butterworth) this London gangster series, which sees Hardy’s fixer tasked with keeping the lid on a potentially devastating mob war, does very little that’s radical but manages the familiar with an engaging slickness.PlutoTV | 21 Jump Street\n Cheerful and cheaper than cheap, this streamer seems to be mostly made up of half-remembered crime dramas from the 80s and 90s. Given that it’s free, we probably shouldn’t complain about a service that includes Prisoner Cell Block H, The Dick Van Dyke Show and the original TV version of 21 Jump Street, featuring a pre-everything Johnny Depp. It’s got a surprisingly tolerable film library too.Prime Video | Bosch: Legacy \n  While Amazon ploughs cash into costly clunkers like its Citadel universe of shows or its notorious golden handcuffs deal with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, its Bosch franchise trundles efficiently on. A fast-paced modern detective procedural, it’s marked out by Titus Welliver’s gruff anguished turn as its titular LAPD gumshoe. A spin-off from the original Bosch series, Legacy has just dropped its final season on Prime, and it sees Harry Bosch juggling a missing family investigation and a probe into his own conduct.U | Silence is Golden\n  Another Prime series we could have flagged is Last One Laughing UK, its hugely successful comedy gameshow where stand-ups staying together in a Big Brother-style house try to not laugh in each other’s company. But as you’ve almost certainly seen that, how about a similarly premised show on UKTV’s streaming service to keep you diverted while you wait for series two? In Silence is Golden, it’s the studio audience who have to avoid tittering in the presence of comics. Do so, and they’ll collectively win a cool £250,000.Each week we run down the five essential pieces of pop culture we’re watching, reading and listening toSign up to The GuideGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Fridayafter newsletter promotionALBUM – Mark Pritchard and Thom Yorke: Tall Tales The second name in this duo you will recognise; the first may be less familiar. But Mark Pritchard has been an important and slightly Zelig-ish figure in the history of British dance music, rocking up as a producer in every scene and subculture from jungle to ambient to grime. He and Thom Yorke first collaborated in 2016, but Covid allowed them to work together more extensively (if remotely). The result is Tall Tales, a jagged collection of forward-thinking dance music, not wildly dissimilar to the more electronic end of Radiohead’s output, though more playful: Gangsters imagines Yorke fronting Kraftwerk, while Happy Days somehow sounds like a techno take on a Soviet battle hymn. Rod Liddle said in the Spectator that the album made him “cry with boredom”, in case you wanted any further recommendation. Out now.Want more?

That’s despite doing episodes on the distinctly un-rewatchable likes of snuff movie horror 8mm. This week they finally rectify that oversight, with a mammoth two-parter considering the film’s massive influence, for good or ill, on movie culture, and wondering whether Chewbacca was actually good at his job.Want more?

The Surfer (pictured above) is classic Cage: a preposterous B-movie revenge thriller about a middle-aged schlub who returns with his son to the Australian bay of his birth to ride the waves, only to be thwarted by a group of local toughs who don’t take kindly to outsiders.

Its arrival, just as Trump was entering the White House for his first term, seemed eerily well timed, and its first series rode a resistance wave to Emmy and ratings glory. But some of its audience soon checked out to its overbearing mood of gloom, not to mention the slightly sketchy plotting to which the show resorted, having run out of source material. Now it enters its final season with Trump back in the White House and more unrestrained than ever: hopefully June’s ending will be happier. New episodes available Saturday, Channel 4.\n     Want more? Hurrah! Poker Face, Natasha Lyonne’s stoner take on Columbo, is back for series two. Its first three eps are available now on Now.

In her next project, a novel called Gunk, her style continues to feel fresh: tender sentences, vivid imagery, deep empathy for difficult characters. Following a nightclub manager, the novel explores different forms of love and family. “At the heart of Gunk is a profound message about the insufficiency of the nuclear family, and a suggestion of possible alternatives. It’s a radical thought, one that Sams is well placed to articulate,” writes Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett in a Guardian review. Want more?

The Atlantic’s Spencer Kornhaber meets these new cultural doomsayers.To quote Chief Wiggum, “they only come out at night or, in this case, in the daytime”: last week we asked for the scariest scenes in film, TV or literature that take place in broad daylight. Here’s what gave you nightmares in the daytime:“What’s round the back of Winkie’s? Something absolutely awful. In Mullholland Drive, David Lynch created such a sense of sweaty-palmed, I-can’t-bear-to-look dread I’ve never forgotten it, over 20 years later. A packed cinema silently cringing at what the camera might reveal, round the back of the cheery diner in sunny LA. Nobody did atmosphere like Lynch. I miss him being alive.” – Suzanne Stockton“In the modern masterpiece It Follows, the malevolent entity is a shapeshifting, slow-walking, sinister stalker, so you find yourself scouring the background of every scene, paranoid that it’s there in a new form. About halfway through the film, the camera pans agonisingly around in two full turns as the protagonist walks through a high school. You could easily miss it, but there’s a long-haired girl walking straight towards the camera, head down, reminiscent of Ringu. It’s not one of the headline horrific or jumpy scenes in the film, but the patient direction, eerie music, and obliviousness of the characters adds up to something terrifying, even while the plot advances in the foreground. Writing this out gives me the shivers.” – Theo Boardman-Pretty“Jaws. When ‘he’ jumps up right next to boat.

            "content": "Take the emotion out of it. It is easier said than done. Tottenham Hotspur are not in the business of hoarding silverware and there will be a temptation to stick with Ange Postecoglou if they beat Manchester United in the Europa League final. The pressure on Daniel Levy to give Postecoglou another chance would be intense. It is not hard to see which way a chair with a history of populist moves would go.Yet there is rarely much to gain from the impulsiveness of judging a manager on the basis of a one-off game that could be won on penalties or with a lucky late goal. The obvious cautionary tale is provided by United keeping Erik ten Hag after last season’s triumph in the FA Cup, only for the Dutchman to be sacked five months later. Serious clubs are supposed to be clinical. The mistake is often to look for wider meaning in a weird and illogical cup run.Look at Chelsea. Would they have been right to give Avram Grant another season if John Terry had scored his penalty in the Champions League final in 2008? Obviously not. Four years later, though, Chelsea were swept away by the romance of becoming European champions after appointing Roberto Di Matteo as caretaker manager. Giving Di Matteo the job on a permanent basis was a mistake. It was not a surprise when he was sacked three months into the following season. There are also parallels with David Moyes leaving West Ham a year after guiding them to Conference League glory. It was West Ham’s first trophy in 43 years but it did not stop supporters grumbling about Moyes’s tactics and their team’s uneven league form.Maintaining a sense of perspective is the challenge. Juande Ramos was the last Spurs manager to lift a trophy but beating Chelsea in the 2008 League Cup final was not the start of a dynasty. Ramos was gone before the turn of the year. Tottenham acted quickly after a disastrous start to the 2008-09 campaign. Any outrage at Ramos’s treatment was forgotten when the Spaniard’s replacement, Harry Redknapp, led the club into the Champions League 18 months later.Yet there will be a case for Levy to give Postecoglou another chance if the Australian wins the club’s first trophy in 17 years. It would be a major achievement. Spurs are the lovable losers. They play nice football but wilt under pressure. The smart money is on United overcoming their awfulness and tapping into their greater knowhow in the final. Spurs cannot match that experience. The challenge for Postecoglou is as much mental as tactical; he has to ensure that his players are not overcome by the size of the occasion. Do that and letting him go would feel harsh.Equally Spurs have to calculate whether success in Europe would demonstrate that Postecoglou is capable of succeeding in English football. An uncomfortable reality for Uefa is that the financial dominance of the Premier League is starting to tell in the Europa League and Conference League.For all their domestic struggles, Spurs and United reaching the final is a predictable turn of events. Spurs are richer than every team they have faced in the knockout phase. They saw off AZ in the last 16, recovering from a first-leg defeat to beat the sixth-best side in the Eredivisie. Eintracht Frankfurt, their quarter-final opponents, sold their star forward Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January and are third in a mundane Bundesliga. A semi-final against the first Norwegian side to go this deep in Europe was even more inviting.Where Postecoglou deserves credit is in how he has adapted his tactics in this competition. He put pragmatism over principles in the second leg against Frankfurt, ensuring that Tottenham won a game many expected them to lose, and a direct approach proved similarly effective against Bodø/Glimt. Spurs were calm, professional and deserving of their 2-0 win on the plastic pitch at the Aspmyra Stadium on Thursday.Yet that flexibility has rarely been seen in the Premier League. Spurs have been chaotic at the back and careless with leads. Nineteen defeats says it all. Postecoglou finished fifth last season but a strong start to the campaign papered over a lot of cracks. It is hard to overlook how bad the league form has been since November 2023.Injuries have been a factor this season. Then again Spurs were not convincing when everyone was available at the start of the campaign. The pressure grew when they squandered a 2-0 lead against Brighton in October. They were close to full strength when they lost at home to Ipswich. There have also been suggestions that Postecoglou’s gung-ho style has contributed to the fitness issues. It is unclear whether Spurs’ cautious approach to recruitment under Levy can cope with the physical demands of Postecoglou’s system. The strain will increase if they are in the Champions League next season.Spurs need to be decisive. They need to act if they conclude that a more suitable manager is out there. The physical and technical advantages they enjoy in Europe are not as pronounced in the Premier League. There is also the question of whether Postecoglou’s relationship with supporters is salvageable. Fans will not easily forget last month’s ear-cupping episode against Chelsea. It adds to the sense that Postecoglou’s best move could be leaving on a high.",

            "content": "Do you know what really stuck out as Maro Itoje sat chatting in the O2 Arena after the British & Irish Lions squad announcement? His biceps. This year’s Lions jersey is tight enough on the shoulders and sufficiently short on the arms to make their already well-muscled captain look like Popeye on steroids. Say what you like about the Lions squad but they have chosen a strong leader.It has worked for them in the past. Who can forget the pipe‑smoking Willie John McBride and his classic response – “Do you think there will be many of them?” – when an angry hotel manager in South Africa threatened to call the police to arrest a number of 1974 Lions who had been enthusiastically “rearranging” the furniture. Legend also has it that Ian McGeechan picked the hulking Martin Johnson as his skipper in 1997 partly because of the intimidating effect he might have on the Springboks – and the referee – when he entered their changing room.A bit of presence, particularly when paired with sharp intelligence, can certainly go a long way in a Lions context. But all successful teams need brain as well as brawn. Which was something Itoje himself was suitably reminded of on Wednesday evening when he dined with illustrious Lions skippers from tours past. Imagine sitting there surrounded by Johnson, Alun Wyn Jones, Sam Warburton and the rest of the chiselled-jaw immortals from rugby’s Mount Rushmore.Maro’s last supper before officially entering the pantheon sounded quite an experience, because all the veterans had nuggets of advice for him. Johnson, no stranger to lifting trophies in Australia, was particularly keen to emphasise just how swiftly circumstances can change, citing the 1993 tour of New Zealand when he was catapulted into the Test team just weeks after arriving as a replacement for Wade Dooley.Seeing Warburton and Jones also reminded Itoje of what made both of them such great captains to play under. “Sam wasn’t necessarily the biggest talker but he led through his actions,” said Itoje. “He was always among the best players and putting his body on the line. Alun Wyn was all pride, passion and Welsh energy. He’s incredibly professional, too, but he also speaks well. They’re both smart, selfless guys.”Which, you suspect, is how Itoje will look to be perceived in Australia. He could – and probably should – have been made England’s captain much earlier and has shown every sign of relishing the responsibility since Steve Borthwick lobbed him the armband at the start of the year. Now 30, he is about to get married – a two-legged fixture taking place in England and, after the tour, Nigeria – and has long had a keen interest in issues far beyond the next lineout.Only the other week he was holding court in Downing Street, discussing his mixed heritage and looking as comfortable doing so as if he were previewing Saracens’ next game. “I’m a rugby player, I’m an athlete,” he said. “But that’s what I do, that’s not who I am. I have other interests, whether it’s philanthropy, whether it’s art, whether it’s politics.” He even joked to Sir Keir Starmer that he was enjoying himself so much at the lectern that he might not leave No 10. “It was a very cool experience. The prime minister is quite a busy man with a few things on his plate – but he was very grateful I was there and he was enjoying the jokes I was cracking.”It must now be hoped he can strike up a similarly good rapport with Andy Farrell, who might have preferred Ireland’s Caelan Doris had the latter not unfortunately been injured last weekend. The two alpha males may appear polar opposites on paper – not many Old Harrovians played for Wigan in Farrell’s playing days – but what they do share is a relentless competitive edge.“I want this Lions squad to be tough,” Itoje said. “I look at that forward pack and I see a group of tough men. I want us to be an incredibly tight group of players that have each other’s back. And I want us to play with the passion, energy and zeal you would expect of a Lions squad. Regardless of who plays, I think that’s what the fans would expect of us.”Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionQuite so. Stir it all together, with a sprinkling of good fortune on top, and you have the basic recipe upon which all successful Lions tours are based. Make no mistake, though, the 2025 Lions will have to be clever as well as energetic to defeat Joe Schmidt’s Wallabies. Itoje, for one, is wary. “The Wallabies now are completely different to the Wallabies two years ago,” he said. “They’re a talented team … talent has never been their issue. Now they have a coaching group who have got them organised, sharp and firing. They’ve got a big, powerful pack and dynamic backs; they’re definitely going to be a challenge.”Will Skelton, Rob Valetini, Taniela Tupou … Itoje is not wrong to suggest Australia have some seriously heavy artillery, with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii also posing a huge aerial threat wider out. But if the touring team can keep their best players fit and foster the necessary esprit de corps on the other side of the world, Itoje could yet join that most distinguished subset of Lions captains, namely those who have returned home victorious.Strip away the team’s glorious heritage and it has happened only once since Johnson’s 1997 squad famously overturned the Boks. The ultimate accolade, consequently, comes laden with responsibility. “The overarching message from all the captains was: one, enjoy it and two, trust yourself,” Itoje said. “Lean on the quality people you will have around you. I am very fortunate that when you look at the squad there is a whole load of talent, quality and leadership there. I think between all of us we can do something special.”",

            "content": "Robert Francis Prevost has been elected as the first pope from the US and is the new leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. Taking the name Leo XIV, the 69-year-old Augustinian friar, spent more than 20 years as a missionary in Peru. Having held senior roles in the Vatican, he is seen as a moderate who people hope will continue the work of his predecessor, Pope Francis.Here, people from around the world share their views on the new pope and their hopes for his papacy.It couldn’t be a better choice. As someone who is from Ecuador and used to live in Peru for several years, I’m happy that the new pope has strong ties with Latin America and Peru, specifically, which is a country that I love dearly and still miss. I was concerned that some extremist from the right or traditionalist could be chosen. I feel relieved that that didn’t happen. Whether people are Catholic or not, the pope’s influence is real – it’s a force for change. I’m happy that someone could even further the reforms that Pope Francis started; the church needs to keep getting closer to reality and help pushing for equality. Carol, 55, homemaker, USI am so excited that Pope Leo XIV is the first American pope! I met with him in October 2023 at a dinner party with his friends from Villanova [University]. I was nervous to speak with him, but being from Chicago I decided I would approach him. He was the friendliest priest I had ever met, conscientious and told us to call him Father Bob. I am still shaking knowing I shook hands and had dinner with him. He will be a wonderful pope. Jan, Pennsylvania, USPope Leo XIV follows in the footsteps of Pope Francis with this spirit of openness towards all peoples. At a time when some want to build walls, he is a good reminder that man must instead build bridges between men so that peace among peoples may prevail. Br Yohann, 52, Christian hermit, French PyreneesSince Trump’s election I’ve been in a pretty big funk. I used to be a hardcore Catholic but I have a gay son and now consider myself to have ‘semi fallen away’. Seeing Pope Leo XIV’s open, warm and very moved face for the first time I got so emotional and prayed along as I listened on the radio. My mom was born right outside of Chicago in Elgin, and I know she’s cheering up in heaven. I loved Pope Francis – his humility and love for the poorest and most marginalized. I was very concerned that the new pontiff would be along the lines of Pope Benedict. What I have glimpsed is hope not only for Catholics but for the world. Mary Lee, Minnesota, USI’m evangelical, so I see the pope as a head of state, first of all, and only afterwards a spiritual leader. Being blind, I’m not influenced by a person’s appearance, but I rely a lot on the tone of voice. Pope Leo conveyed a sense of firmness, gentleness and, above all, honesty. I felt an immediate bond with him. Olga, ItalyI immediately looked up Leo XIII, as popes choose names very cannily, and I was pleased to be reminded he gave us Rerum Novarum, a quite significant encyclical which was part of his attempt to push the church into the modern world. That he is American but also Peruvian, and Chicagoan? He’s Paddington Bear with a Chicago-style hotdog rather than a marmalade sandwich. I’m not a practicing Catholic now but with this choice the movement slowly forward will continue. Samadhi, USI think he is an inspired choice but he is most definitely not the first American pope – Pope Francis has that honour. Pope Leo is certainly the first North American pope and the first from the US, but that country cannot define all of us who live in the rest of the Americas. Lynda Mair, 70, attorney, Kingston, JamaicaAs a gay man and atheist living in Brazil, I found myself strangely drowned and concerned by the election of a new pope. Prevost’s election is undeniably symbolic. His familiarity with Latin America’s struggles, such as poverty, corruption, violence against LGBTQ+ people, could position him as a pragmatic leader.From where I stand, an American pope inevitably sparks concerns about a likelihood of a cultural imperialism. The US already wields outsized geopolitical influence, and a pontiff from Chicago risks perceptions of aligning with western agendas. However, Prevost’s dual Peruvian citizenship and focus on global issues such as climate change might mitigate this. For Brazil’s LGBTQ+ community, which navigates both local homophobia and global solidarity movements, his leadership could either amplify marginalised voices or reinforce Eurocentric priorities. For now, cautious optimism feels like the only rational response. Diego Onorio, 38, English teacher, BrazilI’m Jewish but know how influential the pope can be, not only with his coreligionists but in general. And learning that he’s similar to Francis in leaning liberal and being critical of Trump is a good sign. Vincent, Los Angeles, USHe was always among the second tier of papabile [candidates favoured to be pope] and so in that sense was not a complete surprise. But still, the reality of an American pope took some time to sink in.I suspect the cardinals decided they wanted someone who can communicate effectively on a global basis. Leo XIV speaks numerous languages very well, has lived in South America for many years. The fact he is a native English speaker will be a big asset for the church at this time of political turmoil and rising tensions. \n He appears pretty orthodox on most issues, which I think makes him a pragmatic compromise candidate who can build bridges inside and outside the church. Like many Catholics, at times I found Francis’s pontificate a confusing and unpredictable one. Sometimes that was refreshing; sometimes it caused problems inside the church. I hope Leo XIV provides clarity and stability. Anonymous, 43, works in the media industry, HertfordshireHappy to see a moderate succeed our departed pope. While some of his views are more in line with the older traditions of the church, his desire to confront climate change and fight for refugees is good news! I hope he has chosen the name Leo remembering that Pope Leo rode out to meet an invading force and stopped them at the gate. Lewis, AustraliaI already felt love in my heart upon seeing his face appear on the balcony. The power of his emotions so vividly in his eyes and face. His humility, spirit of service and commitment to those not in the centre very visible. Leo XIV has already stated the most crucial issue: building bridges, world peace, opening ourselves to welcoming all people, ie let us finally as a species embody our shared humanity. Ryūmon H Baldoquín, Zen Buddhist priest, 72 PortugalThroughout the conclave, I’d been really hoping for Cardinal Tagle and mostly focused on the “favourites”, so when his name was read out I was genuinely bewildered.I do have concerns: specifically as to his record on handling sex abuse cases, women’s roles in the church and culture war issues like LGBTQ+ rights. But there are also points for excitement. What drew so many people my age to Pope Francis was his pastoral approach and his rejection of consumerism, and it’s encouraging that the new pope, as an Augustinian, has also taken a vow of poverty. It feels poignant in a world where, as a young person constantly exposed to advertising and consumer culture on social media, it’s easy to feel disillusioned.I’d like to see an affirmation of fiducia supplicans [the declaration that allows priests to bless same-sex couples] because I feel like it’s been watered down. But I also think it’s wise not to alienate conservatives too much. I think most people are ambivalent to Latin mass, and if some people enjoy it then it should be up to their local parish. To be honest, if a pope who had been known mainly for hardline conservatism was elected, I’d be reluctantly considering leaving the church. But for now, I’m carefully hopeful. Ella, 22, law student, OxfordI can’t recall ever in the last 40 years feeling this type of excitement for a new pope. I was on my way to work and as Pope Leo XIV walked out I got emotional and began to cry. I’m not a devout Catholic, I’m not religious but I was so deeply moved and I felt love and hope at that moment. I truly believe that God can do wonders through men. Men who possess an open heart and an open mind, men who show compassion and kindness towards others and who want nothing but the best for all humanity. If only all the world leaders possessed such qualities. Christian, Los Angeles, US",

Barcelona have a four-point lead over Real Madrid at the top with four games left and a win would firm up their grip on the title. That said, Madrid will be eager to go out swinging in Carlo Ancelotti’s last clásico. So far it’s been a clean sweep for Hansi Flick’s side, however. Barça won 4-0 at the Bernabéu in October, then won again 5-2 in January in the Spanish Super Cup final and last month snatched the Copa del Rey 3-2 in extra time amid chaotic scenes in Seville.Best not to mention PSG, but as the champions take on an Arsenal side deflated by their midweek semi-final defeat in Paris, the stakes remain high for Mikel Arteta.

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/09/uk-woman-loses-jail-term-appeal-after-killing-man-as-he-sexually-assaulted-her",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:56",
            "content": "A woman who stabbed a man to death as he sexually assaulted her has lost an appeal against her 17-year jail term.Martyna Ogonowska was handed a life sentence aged 18 after being convicted of the 2018 murder of Filip Jaskiewicz, 23, in a Peterborough car park, using a knife she said she carried for self protection.Sentencing her at Cambridge crown court in 2019, Judge Farrell QC told Ogonowska that Jaskiewicz “undoubtedly touched you sexually and was violent to you shortly before he was killed”. But he said it did not qualify as self-defence because Ogonowska, who he accepted suffered from some mental disability and had experienced previous trauma, had taken a knife to the scene.On Friday, the court of appeal rejected Ogonowska’s appeal against her sentence. An appeal against her conviction was rejected in 2023. Her lawyers had argued that the minimum jail terms should have been 12 to 13 years rather than 17 years.In the court of appeal’s judgment, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith wrote: “However we approach it, this was still a heavy sentence for a young person with the applicant’s attributes to bear; but on the judge’s findings this was a serious crime even after all allowances and mitigation is taken into account. We are ultimately unpersuaded that the sentence imposed by the judge can be described as manifestly excessive such that we should interfere.”During the trial, the court heard that Ogonowska had suffered PTSD as a result of having been raped in 2015 when she was 14. Her alleged rapist was not prosecuted and, at her own trial, Farrell accepted the prosecution’s account – relying partly on Facebook messages between Ogonowska and her alleged attacker – that the intercourse was consensual, despite her age.Justice for Women has described Ogonowska as a “double victim of a misogynist justice system”. Harriet Wistrich, a solicitor and the director of the Centre for Women’s Justice, wrote in 2022 that the case “raises serious questions about whether prosecutors are following their own guidance on rape myths when an alleged victim becomes a defendant”.However, Stuart-Smith said Farrell was entitled to reject Ognowowska’s account of her alleged rape.“It was a tough decision for the judge to take, but he had the well-documented advantages that flow from being the trial judge and this court is neither entitled nor in a position to overturn his finding,” Stuart-Smith wrote.“That being so, the criticism that the judge failed to have regard to the impact of the rape on the applicant’s PTSD and her culpability when committing the murder falls away.“What the judge did was to acknowledge a degree of trauma which lowered her culpability for the killing while not providing the partial defence of diminished responsibility.”Farrell recognised in his sentencing that Ogonowska had suffered previous trauma but said it was “probably the combination of the effect of being moved from Poland, where you were residing as a child, to this country at the age of 12, the bullying that you suffered at school, the post-natal depression that you undoubtedly suffered following the birth of your child and the pressures of trying to integrate into this society”.The court of appeal said Farrell had rightly recognised “significant features of personal mitigation” which caused him to move the minimum term down from the starting point of 25 years.",

            "content": "It’s not often that two sets of people find themselves in the same situation on either side of one of the world’s most fractious borders.When Friday dawned, amid swirling rumours of missiles wrecking neighbourhoods and falsehoods about pilots being captured, cricketers in India and Pakistan sensed that something was about to give.The Pakistan Super League acted first, telling all its players, coaches and officials to stay in their hotel rooms, bags packed at the ready. At some point in the day the call would come, they were told, and they should be ready to head to the airport and fly to the United Arab Emirates where the last eight games of that tournament could be held.In India, the first signs of just how precarious the situation had become emerged the previous evening when a match between the Delhi Capitals and the Punjab Kings was interrupted after 10.1 overs when the floodlights went off in Dharamsala. Initially a technical failure was thought to be the problem, but when senior officials of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association walked out on to the field to urge the crowd to disperse calmly, the penny dropped.On advice of security agencies and the state government, the powers that be that run cricket were told in no uncertain terms that this show must not go on. About 200km away in Jammu drone attacks and missile strikes were foiled, air raid sirens sounded and the city was thrown into a complete blackout.In the end, the Board of Control for Cricket in India announced that the 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League was suspended for a week, and a further decision on whether the tournament would resume, be played later in the year or moved to another country would be taken then.At the same time though, logistics teams at the IPL franchises were scrambling to figure out how to get overseas players back to their countries pronto. “Look, even if it resumes in a week, the players can come back. For the moment, their safety and mental comfort is the most important thing to us,” an official from the Delhi Capitals said, declining to be named as the situation was in flux. “We are looking at charter flights, commercial airlines, all options. Ultimately the players will take the call but I’m sure they are waiting for advisories from their respective countries.”There were 12 league matches plus the playoffs and final remaining to be played in the IPL when it was suspended. While it may appear that this was the most obvious thing to do, given the insignificance of a cricket tournament in the larger scheme of things, the IPL is actually an unusually accurate barometer of the state of affairs in India.The IPL chair, Arun Singh Dhumal, is the brother of Anurag Thakur, the former BCCI secretary and politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and has served variously as union minister for sport, information and broadcasting and finance. The most recent BCCI secretary and current International Cricket Council head, Jay Shah, is the son of Amit Shah, the minister for Home Affairs.This overlap and proximity of politics and cricket ensures that the IPL is acutely aware of what the situation on the ground really is and how quickly things might escalate or de-escalate. Aside from the obvious security threats, those involved with the IPL have the pulse of the nation.Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotionThe preponderance of probabilities: the physical danger to those involved, the sentiment of the largest segment of the audience and the jitters that sponsors felt at being involved with something that could backfire badly, should something untoward happen, meant that the IPL had to be suspended.This decision shows that the IPL has learned from when it played out for far too long in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a time when there were no hospital beds to be had and crematoriums were running out of wood to burn, this garish festival of cricket and excess continued until the public could take it no more and a groundswell of negative reactions forced the hand of administrators.To halt a tournament of this scale is not a decision taken lightly, given the wide range of stakeholders. From those who directly benefit – the players, the broadcasters, the support staff – to the wider cricket ecosystem that hits its annual targets in two months of competition, there is so much riding on the IPL that even suspending it temporarily leaves thousands out of pocket.But the time had come when it was no longer a matter of inconvenience or commerce. Even the IPL does not play on when it’s a matter of life or death.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:50",
            "content": "Despite warnings from European Union officials, Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert Fico, shook hands with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin before becoming the only EU leader to attend Russia’s 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine.The Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, whose country aspires to join the 27-nation union, also accepted the Russian president’s invitation to attend the annual Victory Day celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war.The pair were the only European leaders to travel to Moscow after strong injunctions from EU officials not to do so. On Thursday, the bloc’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said: “All those who truly support peace cannot stand side-by-side with Putin. Those who truly support peace should be in Ukraine tomorrow, not Moscow.”Kallas added this week that the Russian president was “waging a war right now, not a war from history. That remains on the conscience of those attending.”Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, who later on Friday was due to sign a cooperation and friendship treaty with France including joint security and defence commitments, sharply criticised both leaders, although he did so without naming them.Tusk said: “For me it is unthinkable that one can be from this part of the world and, during Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, be in Red Square and celebrate Victory Day with those who are murdering children, civilians and attacking other countries.”It is unclear what, if any, sanctions the EU could apply to either Bratislava or Belgrade. António Costa, the president of the European Council, is due to visit the Serbian capital on Monday. An EU official in Brussels suggested he would express criticism of the visits, saying: “We don’t engage only to pass easy and good messages.”Kallas said last month that participation in the 9 May celebrations in Moscow would “not be taken lightly on the European side”. She called on representatives of EU member states and candidate countries to mark the day in Ukraine instead.The EU foreign affairs chief was one of a 17-strong delegation of EU officials and foreign ministers, which also included the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, in Lviv on Friday to honour the victims of Russia’s war and back a special tribunal to investigate alleged Russian war crimes.Fico, who last met Putin in December, said in April that “nobody will tell me where to go and where not to go”. He said he was going to “a commemorative event, that’s all”, to “pay homage to thousands of Red Army soldiers who died liberating Slovakia”.The Slovakian prime minister, who has adopted Kremlin lines and sided with Hungary’s illiberal leader, Viktor Orbán, as a pro-Russian voice in the EU, also took part in bilateral meetings and attended a wreath-laying ceremony in Moscow.Since winning re-election in 2023, he has halted Slovakia’s military aid to Ukraine, criticised EU sanctions against Russia, and vowed to block Ukraine from joining Nato. He often attacks Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a “comedian who lies as he breathes” and accusing him of “needing this war” to keep his job.He was forced, however, to take a somewhat circuitous route to Moscow on Thursday night to attend the ceremonies after the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia both closed their airspace to flights that might have carried him to the event.Fico’s Slovakian government plane took off from Bratislava airport on Thursday afternoon and was due to land in Moscow at about 9.30pm, but Lithuania said it would not allow flights carrying either him or Vučić to Moscow.Latvia similarly said it it was closing its airspace to any flights carrying guests to the parade, although did not specifically mention Fico. The Baltic bans were “exceptionally complicating our schedule”, Fico said on his Facebook page.Fico’s final flight path took him over Hungary, Romania, the Black Sea, Georgia and the Russian Federation, a journey of more than five hours compared with the two and a half it should have taken.",

            "title": "Labour ‘throwing trans people under the bus’, says transgender councillor",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/09/labour-transgender-people-dylan-tippetts-plymouth",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:44",
            "content": "One of Labour’s only transgender councillors has resigned from the party, accusing it of “throwing trans people under the bus”.In a post on X on Friday morning, Dylan Tippetts, who has represented Compton ward on Plymouth city council since 2022, wrote: “I cannot continue to represent a party that does not support my fundamental rights. I cannot as a trans person continue to support the Labour party.”Tippetts, who was the first Labour councillor to represent the area, will now sit as an independent and confirmed he would not seek re-election.He said: “The Labour party nationally has thrown transgender people under the bus and has taken us backwards decades. Everyone deserves the right to live peacefully, and the Labour party continues to deny transgender people that basic right.”Tippetts’s resignation comes after senior government figures, including Keir Starmer, welcomed the “clarity” provided by the supreme court’s ruling on biological sex.The UK supreme court ruled last month that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 referred only to “a biological woman” and to “biological sex”, with subsequent advice from the equalities watchdog, the Equality and Humans Rights Commission, amounting to a blanket ban on trans people using toilets and other services of the gender they identify as.Tippetts told the Guardian that Labour’s response to the supreme court ruling finally convinced him to quit, after growing concerns prompted by the reported shelving of plans to change the gender recognition process, and the stance of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, on access to trans healthcare.“The government had the chance to consider updating equalities legislation that is clearly out of date, but instead they simply agreed with the ruling and the EHRC guidance and started rolling back on statements like ‘trans women are women’,” said Tippetts.He added that the ruling and EHRC advice had resulted in “chaos” in terms of use of basic facilities. “I’ve been out for seven years. I’ve had no issues using the men’s toilets and now suddenly I’m getting advice from the council’s legal officers saying I should be using single cubicle toilets, the disabled toilets, which puts me in the really uncomfortable position of taking space away from a disabled person.”Responding to the judgment, which has sent shock waves through the UK’s transgender community, the prime minister said: “A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear. I actually welcome the judgment because I think it gives real clarity.”Bridget Phillipson moved to reassure trans people. The equalities minister told the Commons: “The ruling of the supreme court was clear about the importance of biological sex, but I would not want any trans person … anywhere across the country to be fearful.”Subsequently, the Guardian reported that 14 national LGBTQ+ charities had written to Starmer seeking an urgent meeting to discuss what they described as “a genuine crisis for the rights, dignity and inclusion of trans people in the UK”.On Thursday a cross-party committee of MPs wrote to the EHRC seeking assurances that its guidance on how organisations interpreted the ruling did not ignore the needs of transgender people.Tippett said he hoped Starmer’s government would take a moment to reflect. Noting a number of legal challenges being proposed around the ruling, he added: “Our prime minister is a human rights lawyer and he should be nothing short of embarrassed that people in this country feel the need to take his government to the European court of human rights over what’s happening.“I thought this level of erosion of trans rights would only happen in Trump’s America.”A spokesperson for Plymouth Labour said: “We are very disappointed that Cllr Tippetts has taken the decision to resign from the Labour party after he was informed on Thursday evening that he was being replaced as chair of the taxi licensing committee.“The residents of Compton ward deserve three committed councillors so we hope Cllr Tippetts will work hard to represent them during his final year in office.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:24",
            "content": "Pakistan has been accused of launching a fresh wave of drone strikes against India, with projectiles reported over the states of Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab.Early on Saturday morning, a spokesperson for the Pakistan army said India had fired ballistic missiles that fell in Indian territory, making the claim in an unscheduled television broadcast at 1.50am local time.“I want to give you the shocking news that India fired six ballistic missiles from Adampur. One of the ballistic missiles hit in Adampur, the rest of the five missiles hit in Indian Punjab area of Amritsar,” the spokesperson said, offering no further details.Explosions were reported in Amritsar as well as the Pakistani cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Witnesses in Indian Kashmir reported projectiles and flashes in Jammu earlier in the night. Ten blasts were heard near the airport in the Srinagar, and explosions were heard in other parts of the region. Witnesses said the drone strikes were heavier than those that took place on Thursday night.Earlier in the day, India accused Pakistan of launching an attack using up to 400 drones to target cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday night, as the Pakistani military said it would “not de-escalate with India”.India claimed to have intercepted hundreds of Pakistani drones, which it said came across the border into Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat. It said a first wave of drones came on Thursday evening and another wave hit close to dawn on Friday.India said it had launched four drone strikes at Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.In a press conference on Friday, the Indian military alleged that Pakistan’s drone attacks on Thursday had targeted a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, injuring a civilian, and that the drones had also targeted Christian churches.“The targeting of temples, gurdwaras, convents is a new low by Pakistan,” said India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri.Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, denied the drone attacks, calling the Indian army statement “baseless and misleading”, and said Pakistan had not undertaken any “offensive actions” within Indian Kashmir or beyond Pakistan’s border.However, a Pakistan security official said that Thursday night’s drone strikes were just to “heat things up” before Pakistan launched a fully fledged retaliatory attack. “When we hit back, everyone will know,” they said.Misri called Pakistan’s denial of the drone attacks “farcical” and “another example of its duplicity”.The tit-for tat allegations were yet another alarming confrontation between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed countries, since India’s missile strikes on nine sites in Pakistan on Wednesday killed 31 people. Those strikes in turn were India’s response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide.Pakistan said it considered the attack an “act of war” and vowed to retaliate.“We will not de-escalate – with the damages India did on our side, they should take a hit,” Pakistan’s military spokesperson, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said at a media briefing. “So far we have been protecting ourselves but they will get an answer in our own timing.”The Pakistani army gave new details of Wednesday’s strike in which it claimed Pakistan had deployed more than 100 planes to ward off the strikes by Indian planes that carried out the attacks from Indian airspace. It said the two sides had engaged in an hour-long aerial dogfight.Pakistan claimed it used Chinese-made weapons and ground air defences to help bring down five Indian fighter jets. India has yet to respond to allegations that Pakistan shot down its planes, but debris from at least three fighter jets, including that of at least one elite French Rafale jet, was seen in Indian-administered Kashmir and Punjab.The worst-affected area from Thursday’s drone attacks was the city of Jammu, in India-administered Kashmir, which is close to the line of control (LoC), the heavily militarised border dividing the disputed region of Kashmir between India and Pakistan.Despite decades of conflict in the region, people in the city said they had never witnessed such an aerial onslaught. They described a barrage of fiery projectiles streaking across the sky as air raid sirens wailed and the city was plunged into an enforced blackout overnight.Videos shared with the Guardian showed glowing orange dots piercing Jammu’s night sky before flashing and fading – probably drones intercepted by Indian air defence systems. Local officials confirmed debris from the projectiles had been recovered from several areas, including densely populated neighbourhoods in and around Jammu, but no casualties were reported.Ajay Lakhotra, a 24-year-old student in Kanachak, a suburban area close to the Pakistan border, said: “Skirmishes and exchanges of gunfire are nothing new to us, but what happened on Thursday night was extraordinary. We saw fiery objects launching from the Pakistani side; the barrage was so intense it looked like fireworks lighting up the sky. Flames streaked everywhere. It was terrifying to witness.”He said it had quietened down after midnight but restarted at 4am. “Most of us couldn’t sleep all night.”Lethal aggression continued along the LoC as soldiers from both sides continued to fire across the border, killing and injuring civilians. With Pakistan’s threats to retaliate still looming, Indian-administered Kashmir and states across northern India remained on high alert.The mounting aggressions and allegations have resulted in a growing information – and disinformation – war on both sides of the border.India accused Pakistan of a flood of dangerous disinformation and “grossly exaggerated claims” across its media, including reports that dozens of Indian drones had been shot down over Pakistan, calling it a “gross misrepresentation of facts”.“What should have been a moment of international reckoning against terror has instead been manipulated into a disinformation war, where truth is the first casualty,” India’s ministry of information and broadcasting said in a statement.However, mainstream Indian media has also been flooded with misinformation and fake or unsubstantiated reports, including false claims of an attack on Karachi port, reports of a military coup and the arrest of Pakistan’s army chief. Images of Turkish military personnel were broadcast as “captured Pakistani pilots”. Images of powerful bomb strikes on Gaza have been widely shared as showing India’s attack on Pakistan.As part of its alleged crackdown on misinformation, India ordered the social media platform X to block more than 8,000 accounts, including those of Pakistani politicians, celebrities and media organisations, as well as Indian independent news organisations and Indian-Kashmiri journalists.The move was confirmed by X in a statement, which said in many cases the Indian government had not provided legal justification for the blocks.However, X said it had no choice but to comply and remove the 8,000 accounts or it would face “penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees”.",

            "content": "While less dedicated or prolific writers were off boozing with their mates down the local, Roddy Doyle has spent almost a decade writing about it. From 2012-2019, he published three novels – Two Pints, Two More Pints, Two for the Road – in which two sixtysomething Irish men chatted over Guinness, their alcohol units far beyond those specified in the titles.Comprising only dialogue without even character names, the books seemed to call for dramatic form and, in 2017, Doyle premiered a play titled Two Pints in a Dublin pub, the speakers now distinguished as One and Two, tended by Raymond, an almost-silent barman. During lockdown, Doyle added six online duologues, The Zoom Pints, in which the men spoke while drinking alone at home. The collected craic packs a 432-page paperback – The Complete Two Pints.The theatrical banter is now revived in Coventry, and lightly updated to post-Covid Ireland. Summoned by bells from the Belgrade theatre bar, we double-take at a near replica – similar optics and crisp packets – though in reverse: Claire Winfield’s set puts us behind the beer pumps, facing the drinkers. One (Anthony Brophy) is wiry, sarcastic, the drink a relief after visiting his dying father at a nearby hospital. Two (Sean Kearns), often the butt of jokes, is whimsical, quieter but also, we may come to feel, wiser.The conversations tend to fantasy, often involving women they like on television. They cast and review imaginary TV series, including Celebrity Car Park Attendant, in which Nigella Lawson is their favourite ticket vigilante. Another shared passion – football – informs a reverie about which famous players they would and wouldn’t like to meet if there is an afterlife. In which conversation, the “if” is the biggie, the laddish chat gradually overtaken by questions of life and death and the sins of the Irish Catholic church, made urgent by the condition of One’s father.As proved by the easy adaptability of his novels to the screen – The Commitments, The Snapper, The Van – Doyle has an unusual facility with dialogue and gags, which the actors grace. When Brophy remembers the pub raising money “to send the under-17 girls to Korea”, Kearns, after a perfectly held pause, queries: “Did they ever come back?” A reference to Ave Maria being sung at a funeral somehow moves via the Andrews Sisters to deep family memories.Some may resist the sweariness of the banter – the two words most likely to be bleeped on TV are as common as conjunctions – or its insistent masculinity, although Doyle and director Sara Joyce aren’t necessarily endorsing this or expecting the audience to do so. But this is a masterclass in comedy writing and acting. At Belgrade theatre, Coventry, until 24 May",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:15",
            "content": "Metro Bank is at risk of a shareholder backlash after two influential shareholder advisers warned about a complex bonus scheme that could hand the bank’s chief executive a £60m windfall.ISS and Glass Lewis, prominent proxy advisory services that suggest how shareholders should vote on company policies at annual meetings, are concerned that the new long-term bonus will be linked to the bank’s share price, which may climb regardless of how well bosses run it.The reports, published before Metro Bank’s annual shareholder meeting on 20 May, suggest it could lead to excessive, and potentially unwarranted, windfalls for bosses, including the chief executive, Daniel Frumkin.Under the new plan, a bonus would be paid out after five years depending on how high the share price climbs over the long term.Metro Bank’s share price currently sits at about 110p, and would have to climb above 120p in three years’ time for the bonus to kick in. A jump to 437p during that period could earn Frumkin a one-off payment of up to £60m.That would be a major windfall for a chief executive, who last year earned a total of £1.15m, thanks in part to a £153k bonus.Metro was the first high street bank to open in the UK in more than 100 years when it was launched by the US billionaire Vernon Hill in 2010, attracted a wave of customers with dog-friendly branches and seven-day opening hours.But the bank suffered in the years that followed. Its share price was all but wiped out in 2019 after a devastating accounting error led to the resignation of it top executives and founder. It took a further dive in 2023 when it emerged the bank would need more cash from investors after it failed to convince regulators that Metro could be trusted to assess its own risks.Metro was forced into the hands of the Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal as part of a £925m rescue deal in 2023, leading to a massive turnaround plan that has involved more than 1,000 job cuts and a decision to close branches on Sundays.ISS said Metro Bank had “not put forward a convincing case” to support the new bonus plan, while Glass Lewis said it had “severe reservations about recommending shareholders support the remuneration policy at this time”.“Participants may be eligible for extremely high payouts based largely on market forces,” Glass Lewis said. “We generally prefer that incentive awards reflect underlying performance measures that correlate to long-term growth, with appropriate limits.“We recommend that shareholders vote against this proposal,” Glass Lewis added.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionBoth proxy advisers recommended that shareholders reject a special resolution related to the new bonus scheme, as well as the wider remuneration policy. The remuneration policy, which is being overhauled outside the normal three-year cycle, also proposes a jump in annual bonuses that can now be worth up to 150% of salary, compared with 100% previously.The proposed change is likely to be voted through, given the bank is now 53% owned by Bacal, who also sits on its board. However, it could still result in an embarrassing rebellion from remaining shareholders.Metro Bank said in a statement: “The remuneration committee’s approach is based on the delivery of long-term growth generation and the continued turnaround of the bank. The proposed policy is fully aligned with shareholder’s interests and the creation of shareholder value over a sustained period.”Metro has also been called out for falling short on gender diversity, as women account for just 27% of its board. That is shy of the 33% target set for the FTSE 350 firms in line with the Hampton-Alexander review and 40% targets set by the FTSE Women Leaders review. ISS said it had given “qualified support” for the Metro Bank chair, Robert Sharpe, as a result.Metro Bank pointed to a comment from its annual report stating: “We recognise the benefits of having a balanced and diverse board which represents the views, experiences and backgrounds of our customers and colleagues. We are committed to increasing the diversity of our board over time and in line with our board succession plan.”",

            "content": "The final phase of jury selection for the racketeering and sex-trafficking trial of the hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been postponed to Monday.In a ruling on Friday morning, Judge Arun Subramanian, who is presiding over the case in New York, decided that jury selection will now wrap up on Monday morning due to concerns that jurors might drop out over the weekend if the panel was finalized on Friday as originally planned.Combs’s defense team had requested the delay, but prosecutors had opposed the postponement.When the jury selection resumes on Monday morning, a pool of 45 prospective jurors will be narrowed to 12 jurors and six alternates. This final phase is expected to last less than an hour, with opening statements set to follow afterward.Jury selection began on Monday, and nearly 100 potential jurors were questioned this week to assess their ability to be fair and impartial.Combs, 55, was arrested in September and faces charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has been in custody since his arrest, and has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has denied all allegations against him.If convicted on all counts, Combs faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison, and could remain behind bars for life.Prosecutors allege that Combs used his fame, power and expansive business empire, with help of aides and associates, to engage in or attempt to engage in a variety of crimes over several decades including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice.The indictment alleges that Combs directed so-called “freak offs”, which are described as drugged-up orgies allegedly arranged with help from Combs’s associates, in which women were allegedly forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.Combs’s lawyers have said that the prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults, asserting that any group sex was consensual.The trial is expected to feature testimony from at least three, possibly four, accusers, according to Reuters.However, earlier this week, prosecutors informed the court that one of the alleged victims, referred to as “Victim-3” in court documents, may not testify after all, due to difficulties reaching her lawyer.As of Friday morning, it remained uncertain whether “Victim-3” will take the stand.On Friday, Combs’s defense attorneys informed the judge of their plan to show that there was mutual violence between Combs and his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, who is expected to be a key witness in the upcoming trial, Reuters reported.The judge appeared disinclined to allow the defense to introduce evidence of alleged violence by Ventura, but said that he would rule on the matter on Monday.The Associated Press contributed reporting",

            "content": "Modern slavery victims are choosing to stay with their exploiters rather than access government support designed to protect them for fear of immigration enforcement, research has found.The independent anti-slavery commissioner, Eleanor Lyons, said the system was “deeply broken”.Two pieces of research shared exclusively with the Guardian found that, a decade after the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act, the landmark piece of legislation designed to protect trafficking victims and apprehend their perpetrators was failing.The first study, from Nottingham University’s Rights Lab and commissioned by Lyons’ office, will be published next Wednesday.The report, titled Refusal to Consent, found refusals to access help from the government’s support system for trafficking victims, were at record levels.Potential victims who come into contact with the authorities but do not want to use the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) are recorded in statistics known as duty to notify. These reports have soared by more than 630% since 2016 – from 762 in 2016 to 5,598 in 2024 – a sign victims are losing trust in the system.Fear of deportation is the primary reason victims are rejecting support, according to the report, which questioned professionals working with victims and analysed government and academic data.Many victims believe the NRM is a trap that leads to immigration enforcement rather than protection. Hostile immigration policies and inflammatory language from the government is scaring victims away from the systems supposed to protect them, it found.Some traffickers use government rhetoric about the hostile environment and the threat of deportation to keep their victims in a position of exploitation, according to the research.Government return agreements with Albania and Vietnam, which have high numbers of trafficking victims, have increased fear of coming forward among victims from those countries. In 2024 victims of trafficking were among people being issued with notices of intent that they were going to be forcibly removed to Rwanda.The second report, Barriers to Prosecutions and Convictions under the Modern Slavery Act 2015, is from the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre at the University of Oxford. It commissioned research from the Wilberforce Institute at the University of Hull, which analysed prosecution data since the act was introduced and found it remained low, with prosecutions as a percentage of potential trafficking victims referred to the NRM at just 1.8%.Between July 2023 and June 2024 17,120 potential modern slavery victims were referred to the NRM while over the same period 58 people in England and Wales were convicted of offences linked to modern slavery.Alicia Heys, an academic at the University of Hull who authored the study for the PEC, said: “Part of the intention behind the Modern Slavery Act was to ensure that perpetrators receive suitably severe punishments, yet 10 years after the introduction of the act, conviction rates remain low. Sometimes, offenders are pursued under different legislation, for example relating to drugs or controlling prostitution, which misrepresents survivors’ experiences.”Lyons said: “It’s heartbreaking but not surprising that more and more potential victims of modern slavery are saying no to help.“When fear of deportation outweighs the promise of protection, when there are few consequences for criminal perpetrators and people feel safer staying in exploitation than entering the system that’s meant to help them, something is deeply broken.“This report is a wake-up call: the national referral mechanism, the government’s framework of support, isn’t just misunderstood, it’s mistrusted, mishandled, and in urgent need of reform.”The Home Office has been approached for comment.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:00",
            "content": "Retired supreme court Justice David H Souter, the ascetic bachelor and New Hampshire Republican who became a darling of liberals during his nearly 20 years on the bench, has died. He was 85.Souter died on Thursday at his home in New Hampshire, the court said in a statement Friday. John Roberts, the chief justice, said Souter, who retired from the court in 2009, “brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service”.Souter’s retirement gave Barack Obama his first supreme court vacancy to fill. Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s first Latina justice.Souter was appointed by George HW Bush in 1990, and quickly dashed the expectations of the conservative right that had cheered his elevation. He was a reliably liberal vote on abortion, church-state relations, freedom of expression and the accessibility of federal courts.In 1992, he joined Justices Anthony M Kennedy and Sandra Day O’Connor, also appointed by Republican presidents, in a three-member affirmation of women’s federally protected right to abortion.Reversing the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling, Souter wrote, would be a “surrender to political pressure. To overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the court’s legitimacy beyond any serious question.”A subsequent conservative supreme court majority, including three Donald Trump picks, overturned Roe v Wade in 2022.Souter was the 105th supreme court justice, and only its sixth bachelor.In retirement, Souter warned that ignorance of how government works could undermine American democracy, words that appear almost prescient today following Trump’s accession to the White House and attacks on the judicial system.“What I worry about is that when problems are not addressed, people will not know who is responsible. And when the problems get bad enough … some one person will come forward and say: ‘Give me total power and I will solve this problem.’ That is how the Roman republic fell,” Souter said in a 2012 interview.\n His lifestyle was simple and frugal. His lunch, eaten at his desk, was typically a yogurt and apple. He distanced himself from Washington DC’s social scene, and every June, as soon as supreme court work was finished, he drove his Volkswagen Jetta back to the aged farmhouse in Weare, New Hampshire, where his family moved when he was 11.He enjoyed nature, and would spend the summer recess hiking in the mountains, and reading. \n For all his reserve, Souter was beloved by colleagues, court employees and friends. He was a noted storyteller and generous with his time.\n Roberts wrote: “Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly 20 years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service”. Roberts noted that Souter continued hearing cases on the first US circuit court of appeals for more than a decade after he retired from the supreme court.\n When Bush plucked Souter from obscurity in 1990, liberal interest groups feared he would be the pivotal vote that would undo Roe v Wade, with some observers calling him a stealth nominee, and the White House aide John Sununu, the former conservative governor of New Hampshire, calling the choice a “home run”.Souter’s conservatism, however, was moderate, and hardliners were dismayed by his 1992 Roe v Wade affirmation. According to the Washington Post, conservatives who were disappointed in his performance looked at subsequent supreme court vacancies with an attitude of “no more Souters”.He asked precise questions during argument sessions, sometimes with a fierceness that belied his low-key manner. “He had an unerring knack of finding the weakest link in your argument,” the veteran supreme court advocate Carter Phillips said.\n Although he became to be seen as a liberal justice, some of Souter’s rulings were not. In 2008 he sided with Exxon Mobil Corp in slashing the punitive damages the company owed Alaskan victims of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.He was hailed by the Post as the capital city’s most prominently eligible single man when he moved from New Hampshire in 1990 at the age of 51, but Souter resolutely resisted social engagements.\n “I wasn’t that kind of person before I moved to Washington, and, at this age, I don’t see any reason to change,” he told an acquaintance.\n He worked seven days a week through most of the court’s term from October to early summer, staying at his office for more than 12 hours a day. He said he underwent an annual “intellectual lobotomy” at the start of each term because he had so little time to read for pleasure.Before serving as a New Hampshire judge, Souter was his state’s attorney general for two years. He worked on the attorney general’s staff the eight previous years, after a brief stint in private practice.\n Souter earned his undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard University, and a master’s degree from Oxford as a Rhodes scholar Washington DC.The Associated Press contributed to this report",

            "content": "Over the last decade, Dean has amassed a healthy collection of video games, from smash hits to cult classics. His digital library is like a modern day Blockbuster, all readily accessible with just a click or two. But his son, Sam, has eyes for only one video game: Roblox, the behemoth virtual universe-slash-video game that’s among the most popular on the planet.The company reports that more than 97 million people log on to Roblox every day. Around 40% of those are, like Sam, under 13 years of age. In 2024, Roblox generated around A$5.6bn (US$3.6bn) in revenue, largely through purchases of “Robux”, its virtual currency, with the average user dropping around A$25 per month.While much attention has been paid to children’s use of Roblox in terms of exposure to bullying, inappropriate and even abusive content, a new report has raised concerns about the impact of video game monetisation on children.Meanwhile, some experts claim Australia’s current classification system does not go far enough in helping child video game players and their parents navigate confusing monetisation systems.Dark design patterns – which aim to steer player behaviour – have come under scrutiny in two new reports by Australian researchers. Such features encourage users to spend money, often obfuscating their value or using confusing virtual currencies and can be difficult for children to fully comprehend.One recent report by Monash University and think tank the Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC), which focused on players aged 18 years and older, highlighted that games designed with dark patterns are almost unavoidable. Of 800 survey respondents, 83% had experienced “negative impacts” of these patterns and 46% had experienced some kind of financial detriment; more than a quarter said they felt pressured to buy something, and 30% had spent more on a game than they had intended.A separate new study, by researchers at the University of Sydney, has attempted to examine how children – who make up one-fifth of the gaming population – perceive these mechanisms and how to ensure video games are more appropriately designed for them.“There’s a tendency for issues around children’s digital media use to become media-panicky and lead to policy decisions which haven’t taken children’s actual experiences into account,” says Taylor Hardwick, the lead author of the study.Hardwick and her team conducted interviews with 22 children, aged between 7 and 14 years of age, as well as their parents. Each child was given a $20 debit card and told they could spend it however they like – they just needed to explain what they were buying and why.Eighteen of the 22 children in the cohort played Roblox and 12 decided to spend their entire $20 in the game, buying up Robux. Another five children used it in other digital games such as Call of Duty, Fallout 76 and Minecraft.Children in the study reported being most concerned about feeing misled, frustrated or regretful of their purchases, particularly when they lose access to accounts or items without warning or recourse.Sam’s father says Sam has spent around $400 on Roblox annually over the last four years. A few months ago, one of his purchases left him feeling dejected.Sam had used some of his Robux to buy a “skin” – essentially a digital costume — of Godzilla in an extremely popular Roblox game called Kaiju Universe. But when he signed into the game, the skin had disappeared without warning. Toho, the copyright holder for the Godzilla licence, had shut down the game, leaving Sam without the digital skin. He did not receive a refund from Roblox.But it is children’s engagement with “random reward mechanisms” (RRMs) that the Sydney University researchers highlighted as one of the major problems. RRMs such as loot boxes provide players a chance to score a mystery item in a lottery or lucky-dip style “draw”.While the children in the study “accepted” that RRMs were part of the gaming experience, many did not like it.“Children do not possess sufficient understanding of probability as well as risk to effectively navigate these aspects of their digital play, even if they are able to speak in the game’s percentage-laden vernacular,” the authors wrote. “RRMs and similar gambling-like mechanics are harmful and not appropriate in games for children.”They recommend removing RRMs entirely, easier access to refunds, stronger protections on children’s accounts and greater transparency and flexibility with virtual currencies.Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist at Stetson University, said the study is interesting but pointed out it uses a small sample size. He was not convinced by the researchers’ definition of “harm” either; although children might feel scammed or tricked, he suggests the monetisation aspects they are encountering may be more an annoyance than a harm.“I’m glad that researchers are actually asking kids what they think about the experience,” he says, “but I think we ought to be a little bit more cautious about the word ‘harmful’.”Sign up to Pushing ButtonsKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingafter newsletter promotionAustralia has attempted to keep children from monetised RRMs by implementing a new classification scheme which came into force in September 2024. Now, any game containing RRMs or loot boxes must be rated M and not recommended for children under 15 years of age.But the new rules only apply to newly classified games, and older games were not required to update their classification – unless the developer updates the game.Leon Xiao, a researcher at City University Hong Kong who studies the regulation of loot boxes, says that Australia has “an implementation issue, rather than a problem with the law itself.” He claims some video games have been incorrectly rated after the new legislation kicked in and suggests the intent of the law to better educate consumers has failed.Preliminary research by Marcus Carter, a co-author on the University of Sydney study, suggests around 20% of the Top 100 grossing mobile games in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store do not comply with Australian regulations. Hardwick and Carter recently wrote Australia’s new guidelines are “not fit for purpose.”Roblox, with its mountains of user-generated content, is a prime example of the confusion in the ratings. Xiao argues “Roblox most certainly should now be rated M or not recommended for players under 15.” But the game is rated PG on the Google Play Store.Meanwhile on Apple’s App Store, the regional age rating is 15+. The latter also contains a global age rating, provided by Apple, of 12+.A Roblox spokesperson told Guardian Australia that creators must use its PolicyService API to ensure they are compliant in all jurisdictions and this ensures “paid random items are accessible only to eligible users”. An update sent to developers in September 2024 would make paid random items unavailable to Australian users.“As a user-generated content platform, we provide our developer community with tools, information and guidelines that apply to aspects of gameplay within their games and experiences, including the recent classification update in Australia relating to paid random items,” a Roblox spokesperson said.“We take action on reports of content not following guidelines or not using our tools properly to meet local compliance requirements in Australia.”The company says it gives parents information about their children’s purchasing behaviour, does not store billing information as default and issues warnings – at the first transaction – that users are spending real money. Parents are also alerted in email about high spending behaviour.“Our parental controls feature enables parents and caretakers to receive spending notifications for their child’s spending in Roblox and set monthly limits on their child’s account,” the spokesperson said.Hardwick says monetisation is difficult for “busy, underinformed and under-resourced” parents to navigate. She says they are not being given the tools to understand and approach their kids’ in-game spending.Dean is doing his best to buck that trend with Sam, discussing with his son what Sam’s spending his Robux on and why. He says Sam is still sore about the Godzilla skin, but has moved on to a gardening game, where he can spend Robux on buying new seeds – and where Sam assures him there’s no loot boxes involved.* names have been changed",

            "content": "Ian Wilkinson sat in the witness box, a crucifix within an ichthys pinned over his heart, and told the supreme court about four people he shared lunch with on 29 July 2023.Three of those people are dead, and the other is accused of killing them.Wilkinson gave evidence this week in Erin Patterson’s triple murder trial. She has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges, and to the attempted murder of Wilkinson.A cheerful man, who laughed freely and a little nervously throughout his evidence, Wilkinson is a pastor at the Korumburra Baptist church, about 70km away from the Latrobe Valley law courts in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria.Wilkinson had just finished a sermon on 16 July 2023 when Patterson approached Heather Wilkinson, his wife, and Gail Patterson, Erin’s mother-in-law, in church.“Just the two I was looking for,” Patterson said to them, the court heard.Patterson went on to invite the sisters and their husbands to lunch. Wilkinson told the court he was happy and excited, if not somewhat puzzled, to be invited.He said Patterson was an acquaintance but there was little depth to their relationship. Heather spoke to her more, though neither considered themselves close to Patterson. They had never dined at her house before.A fortnight later, the group sat down in Patterson’s open-plan dining area to a meal of beef wellington with mashed potato and green beans. The Wilkinsons brought fruit for dessert, and the Pattersons an orange cake.After they ate, Wilkinson finally understood why they had been invited: Patterson, he told the court, informed her guests she had cancer.Wilkinson said Patterson wanted advice on how to tell the two children she shared with Simon Patterson, her estranged husband.The group were in agreement that she should be honest with the children, Wilkinson said. The conversation occurred around the dining table, Wilkinson sitting at the head of the table, with Don Patterson next to Gail, to his right, and Erin opposite Don to his left.Simon had also planned to attend, but told Patterson the night before he would not be coming.One of the group noticed, during the conversation about cancer, that Patterson’s son was returning home with a friend, Wilkinson told the court.“I realised we weren’t going to be able to continue [the conversation], that we hadn’t prayed about it, so I suggested that we pray,” Wilkinson said.“I prayed a prayer asking God’s blessing on Erin, that she would get the treatment that she needed, that the kids would be OK, that she’d have wisdom in how she told the kids and then the prayer concluded as the boys arrived in the room.”But a written statement read to the court this week from Danielle Romane, of the Victorian Department of Health, said a search of the state’s cancer registry found no record of Patterson having received a cancer diagnosis.Wilkinson left soon after the cancer conversation so he could meet the church secretary and treasurer at his home, ahead of a congregation meeting scheduled for the following day.Later that night, Ian heard Heather leave bed and vomit in the laundry sink. He felt alright at that point, he told the court, but soon after had to vomit too.The Wilkinsons were admitted to Leongatha hospital within hours. Heather never made it home.Ian told the court this week that he had no memory of his treatment after being given a charcoal substance to drink in a bid to overcome death cap mushroom poisoning. He was placed in a coma soon after.He was eventually discharged from hospital almost two months after the lunch, in September 2023.Patterson’s time in hospital was far shorter, the court heard. She discharged herself after only five minutes on her first visit to hospital on 31 July 2023, two days after the lunch.Two doctors and a nurse spoke with her during these five minutes to implore her to stay, saying that her heart rate and blood pressure readings indicated she could also have been poisoned, and that the effectiveness of her treatment relied on it starting as soon as possible.Patterson said she was not prepared to be admitted, but would come back in 20 minutes.Dr Christopher Webster told the court he was surprised when a nurse told him that Patterson had left. “I had just informed her that she’d been exposed to a potential deadly death cap mushroom poisoning and I thought that being in hospital would be a better place for her to be,” he said.He tried to call her three times, and when she didn’t answer he phoned the hospital’s CEO and director of medical services to get clearance to phone the police.“When you have to consider treating a patient against their will, it becomes quite a serious situation and I wanted … them to be informed before I did that,” Webster said.Erin Patterson hosts lunch for estranged husband Simon’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt and uncle Heather and Ian Wilkinson. Patterson serves beef wellington.All four lunch guests are admitted to hospital with gastro-like symptoms. Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson die in hospital. Don Patterson dies in hospital. Victoria police search Erin Patterson’s home and interview her. Ian Wilkinson is discharged from hospital after weeks in intensive care.Police again search Erin Patterson’s home, and she is arrested and interviewed. She is charged with three counts of murder relating to the deaths of Don and Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson. Jury is sworn in. Murder trial begins. Jury hears that charges of attempting to murder her estranged husband Simon are dropped.Patterson returned to hospital about 90 minutes later, before police arrived at her house.Cindy Munro, a nurse who treated the Wilkinsons earlier that day, noted the difference between them and Patterson after she was admitted: she was sitting up and “didn’t look unwell”, whereas Ian “could barely lift his head off the pillow”.Patterson was transferred to the Monash hospital later that day, and discharged home on 1 August.“The prosecution says that Erin Patterson was pretending to be sick and that’s an issue in this trial,” Colin Mandy SC, Patterson’s defence barrister, told the court in his opening statement.“The defence case is that she was not feigning illness, she wasn’t pretending to be sick … she was sick too, just not as sick.“And the defence case is that she was unwell because she’d eaten some of the meal.”The prosecution says that the day after Patterson returned home, she drove to a local tip and dumped a food dehydrator that a forensic examination revealed contained her fingerprints, and traces of death cap mushrooms. They allege she also conducted a factory reset on one of her mobile phones.Evidence from Simon and Erin Patterson’s children was also heard in court this week. Both children were separately interviewed by police on 16 August 2023, and footage of these interviews was played to the jury.Patterson’s son and daughter were fed leftovers of the meal for dinner on 30 July, despite Patterson telling them she felt unwell earlier.At the start of their evidence, both of the children were asked to define what was the truth and what was a lie.A lie, the Pattersons’ son said, was “something that is wrong, something that you know didn’t happen, something that you know is wrong”.Mandy says that Patterson, in a panic that she had accidentally poisoned her lunch guests, lied to police after the lunch by telling them she had never before foraged for mushrooms, nor owned a food dehydrator.The relationship between Simon and Erin Patterson was again unpicked in detail during the trial this week.Their son described it as “very negative”, and said his father “does a lot of things to try and hurt mum”. He said Simon contacted his school to be included on billing records, so that he could be informed of his children’s activities and school reports, but did this without contacting Patterson.Three Facebook friends outlined Patterson’s concerns about Simon and his family’s faith, with one saying Patterson described his behaviour as controlling and coercive.More messages exchanged between the estranged couple, including in a group chat involving Don and Gail, were also shown to the court.It painted a clearer picture of the animosity that developed in late 2022 amid a dispute about child support payments.“I foolishly trusted him to do right by me and the kids when it came to the crunch,” Patterson wrote in one long message posted in a group chat between her, Simon and Don and Gail.There have now been 27 witnesses called in the case, and Justice Christopher Beale told the jury this week that the trial could finish sooner than expected.But there has been no shifting from the message he gave them before any witness had been heard – the two key questions being: did Patterson intend to poison her guests with death cap mushrooms, and did she mean to kill or cause serious injury to them when she did so?The trial continues.",

            "content": "Days after Labor won a decisive victory with a mandate to fix housing affordability, those in charge of handing out mortgages poured cold water on it coming to pass.Andrew Irvine, the chief executive of National Australia Bank, said the country “may not get the outcome we want” as the gulf between homeowners and everybody else threatens to expand in the coming months.The long-serving ANZ chief executive, Shayne Elliott, was even more forthright when addressing media on Thursday.“I don’t know we are dealing with it. I mean, things are getting worse,” said Elliott, who stepped down from his role on Friday after almost a decade leading the bank.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“I know there’s really well-meaning, really thoughtful policies on both sides of politics … but the reality is, as we sit here today, I’m not sure there’s confidence that we are going to see any material change any time soon.”The bank bosses pointed to a lack of housing supply for their dour outlook.There are also other factors, such as the need to improve transport networks and infrastructure to ignite that supply, resolve unnecessary planning impediments, tackle high building costs and labour constraints.The affordability problem has built up over decades, and Australia’s banking CEOs don’t believe the issue will be resolved any time soon.“The Australian dream is owning a home, and you want younger people to have a chance to do that, you want new Australians to have a chance to do that,” said Irvine.“The only way we’re going to address this is to fix supply. It’s still the case that too much of the discourse on housing is on the demand side.”The lack of reformist housing policies – economists criticised both sides of politics for their competing election platforms – is fuelling an expectation that home prices will just keep rising, putting home ownership even further out of reach for younger generations.Many housing reform advocates gave up on expecting federal governments to help resolve the issue after Labor’s ill-fated 2019 campaign to overhaul negative gearing and capital gains tax, both of which would have represented robust reforms.Advocates are now focusing their attention on rental rights, which are a state issue. The thinking is that improving tenancy rights may lower the value of rental properties, easing affordability at the expense of landlords.Those already on the property ladder don’t want to get off it.Even the banks were surprised how many of those who scrambled to get a mortgage in recent years – and then faced a string of interest rate increases and sharp rise in living costs – kept up with repayments.“The resilience of customers who have navigated significant cost-of-living challenges over the past few years is impressive,” Westpac chief executive Anthony Miller said on Monday, after delivering the bank’s half-year results.Part of the reason people clung on to their mortgages so tightly is that there are no good alternatives, given the tight rental market.Mortgage arrears at the major banks have tended to plateau, or even drop, over the past six months, hovering well below pre-pandemic levels. The number of households requesting hardship packages from their lenders has generally been falling.For those able to hang on to their mortgages, relief is in sight.After the Reserve Bank reduced borrowing rates in February, a quarter-of-a-percentage point cut in the cash rate on 20 May is deemed a sure thing, and would lower the key rate to 3.85%, from 4.1%.From there, financial markets are pricing in a further three cuts to 3.1% by December. Experts are a little less bullish, with a general consensus that the cash rate will end 2025 at 3.35%.Either way, mortgage holders are set to receive substantial relief on their interest payments.The monthly repayment on a $500,000 loan at an interest rate of 6.01% is $3,225.\n Every cut of 0.25 percentage points lowers the interest bill by $76 a month. A further four rate cuts this year would deliver a $304 boost to monthly household budgets.While existing homeowners will be cheering falling rates, the picture is more complicated for those hoping to break into the property market, or upgrade towards a family home.Lower interest rates boosts borrowing capacity – meaning buyers can afford to pay more. But cheaper money will also lift prices and potentially widen the deposit gap, and worsen the affordability crisis.AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said he expected a rate cut on 20 May followed by another in August. He then expects a cut in November and then again early next year.Oliver said the combination of cheaper loans and Labor’s election housing policy to help first home buyers buy with a smaller deposit would ultimately push property prices higher.“Lower rates and 5% deposits may feel like a good thing, and if you get in early it will be, because they can borrow more and it will be easier to service your loan,” he said.“For those who get in later (after prices have started climbing faster), it’s not so good – and the ultimate winners are existing homeowners.”Louis Christopher, the founder of SQM Research, said rate cuts – if they happen – will have a progressively greater impact on house prices as the year passes.Still, with the election and April holidays out of the way, Christopher expects a busy winter of property auctions.“We expect housing prices across the country to climb by 6-10% in 2025,” he said.",

            "content": "“If we’re going to see koalas today, it will be in the next few hundred metres,” my guide calls to me as we tackle stage two of the Clare Valley wine and wilderness trail.So far, flame robins have licked the trees just in front of us, galahs have shrieked to mark our arrival in otherwise serene clearings, and roos have skipped away, barely snapping a twig.There are no koalas but, before long, we have managed to sneak up on a winery. It comes with barely a warning, out of the bush, and before we know it we’ve been relieved of our packs and are enjoying Jeanneret’s finest riesling from the deck.There will come a time on the trail, perhaps after a sip of riesling or a bite of something particularly delicious, when you will question if it only tastes that satisfying because you had to walk to get it. After all, even a squashed muesli bar and a swig from a water bottle is sumptuous after a decent trek. But the answer to this question is mostly no; what you are consuming really is that good, walking or not.The Clare Valley trail was completed last year. A Covid project led by Michael Nugent and Tim Grigg, it was driven by a wider community group who maintain the path on a voluntary basis.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIt loops about 100km around the perimeter of the valley, as well as taking in other valleys running parallel to the Clare. Along the track, there’s not just wine but breweries, distilleries and towns, the largest of which is Clare. It takes six days to walk its length.The walking is mostly moderate – I had hiking boots but trail shoes or even runners would also be OK – with a few tougher climbs. It is also wonderfully quiet. I only saw one other group of five my entire three mornings on the track, although the wineries I visited almost all hummed with people in the school holidays (and the week after AFL gather round).After walking to Jeanneret on stage two – taking in South Australia’s only stand of red stringybark, the westernmost in the country – we continued a little longer for lunch at Skillogalee.This walk of less than 2km between vineyards is one of several shorter walks that can be cleaved off from the trail, for those keen for a taste without committing to an entire morning, or more, of hiking.The next day I tackled part of stage six, walking from just outside the Sevenhill hotel to Pikes cellar door.The track covers both public and private land, including fire trails and road reservations. It involves clambering over iron-red stiles – many of them made by a local men’s shed.Walking through other people’s properties and climbing over fences can give the sense you are being a little naughty; are you going to taste this wine or steal it?On foot, it is easier to appreciate the landscape that makes Clare Valley wines highly awarded. You can sense how the valley’s shape creates pockets of microclimate, and how the geology can change markedly from slate to limestone and quartz, over short distances.This helps when you settle in somewhere like Pikes cellar door. With a dizzying list of wines to try, you can limit it to vineyards you’ve just walked past.As I walk, there is no escaping that the Clare is experiencing a severe drought. Several people apologise to me for how dry it is.Tim Adams, who has made wine in the region for 50 years, reckons he’s never seen it drier. I spent my final day walking a slightly modified part of stage one, which took in Adams’ cellar door and lunch at his restaurant in Clare, Mr Micks. In between, we trek through Hill River Station, and along a ridge which affords views across Clare Valley. It may be dry, but it is still majestic.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe region is especially known for riesling and cabernet sauvignon, and most wineries will have multiple versions of both.My standouts were Jeanneret, Pikes and Tim Adams (for tastings, all three require bookings). Pauletts and Skillogalee also had great wine, and dégustation and à la carte menus. The Penobscot Restaurant at the Watervale hotel is the fanciest dining option in the valley but there are great cheap places too, including at the Clare Rise and Little Red Grape bakeries in Clare and Sevenhill. Sevenhill hotel also serves excellent pub food (try to get a table in the cellar). Most wineries will happily help you arrange freight of your wine, as will Clare’s tourist information centre.Clare is the biggest town in the region and there are multiple options here, from the caravan park (from $30 for a powered tent site and $148 for a one-bedroom cabin) to self-contained apartments (from $330 a night). There are other options in semi-rural settings, including Neagles Retreat Villas (from $360 a night) and tiny homes at CABN Clare Valley ($330 a night) . There’s also free camping in the car park across from the Watervale.Clare Valley Walk offers multiple packages for people keen to do the full hike, either guided or by themselves, including accommodation and dining options. A three-day, two-night package including food, transit and accommodation starts at $670 a person. I set out between 9am and 10am each morning and reached each winery in time for lunch but in warmer months you could start earlier, leaving more time for wine.To do the multi-day hike without a guide service, you will need a car or alternative transport arrangements (taxis are available in the region, with Uber also expected to launch soon). The cheapest way to do it would be with a companion, by parking a car at the end of each day’s leg, then travelling together to the start in a second car.A camping ground on the trail is expected to open soon, with more to follow.All six stages of the walk are achievable in a day each but there are lots of ways to shorten stages, or to get a taste of the walk without forgoing too much wine time.You could modify stage one by starting near Farrell Flat Road, walking along the ridge, down to Tim Adams Wines, and then on to the newly opened Clare Valley Distillery (making it closer to 7km than 21km).I also loved the modified stage six walk, which almost halves the length by leaving from Sevenhill hotel and ending at Pauletts (you can extend further by also detouring to Pikes), and the final third of stage two, which went through the Spring Gully conservation park after starting at the Blue Gum lookout, and ended at Skillogalee via Jeanneret.Guardian Australia travelled to Clare Valley courtesy of South Australian Tourism Commission",

            "content": "On the Saturday after he called the federal election, Anthony Albanese hosted members of the travelling media pack for an informal drink at the Lodge. There was light rain in Canberra, forcing an event that would usually have taken place in the garden to be held inside in a relaxed sitting room with Jeffrey Smart paintings and Albanese’s record player in the corner.For a man facing a tough re-election fight, the prime minister appeared confident and relaxed. Mixing with his partner, Jodie Hayden, and senior ministers including Katy Gallagher and Mark Butler, Albanese told sceptical journalists that Labor was not only on track to hold its majority, but would win Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson on 3 May.Labor had been working for weeks on understanding the Queensland electorate and preparing to back in third-time candidate Ali France to beat the opposition leader on his home turf. In retrospect, Albanese’s confidence was well placed, but five weeks out from election day it sounded a lot like bluster.But, after he convened a packed caucus meeting at Parliament House on Friday, the scale of the government’s re-election is clear for the first time.Instead of slipping into minority, Albanese defied history and defied the commentators. Labor is on track to hold more than 90 seats in the lower house, and with the Coalition smashed, on the numbers alone Albanese could have the next election in the bag already.The result means the man who came to Canberra to fight Tories now has the opportunity to live up to the records of previous residents of the Lodge. Albanese told voters he needed multiple terms in office to achieve a lasting legacy, and now he has the chance to deliver.“We don’t seek power for its own sake,” Albanese said on Friday. “We seek power in order to deliver for the people who need Labor to be in government, and to develop a better nation. That is our objective, each and every day.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailHe nominated stronger healthcare and education, a properly functioning disability system, improved economic and social outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and respect for the immigrants who have woven the country’s multicultural fabric, as the government’s business-as-usual work.Albanese himself has easily stepped back into the work of being prime minister, holding calls with world leaders and preparing to return to the international stage in a visit to Indonesia on Tuesday next week. He plans to bring MPs back to parliament in late July, when the work of legislating Labor’s election promises gets under way. Late next month he will travel to the G7 summit in Canada, a trip that could include a visit to the White House to see the US president, Donald Trump.Proud to point out that he has been often underestimated throughout his career, Albanese will need ambition for a series of urgent challenges.One is to finish the job on Australia’s transition to renewable energy and reduce emissions in line with yet-to-be decided 2035 targets. Labor’s own environmental network this week pushed for a target of 70% of 2005 levels, and for the government’s stalled “nature positive” laws to be passed by parliament in full by this time next year.The prime minister overruled the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, on a plan to pass the legislation before Christmas, delaying the establishment of a national environment protection agency to avoid being seen to be making deals with the Greens so close to an election. He has promised a whole new model. Plibersek’s future in the portfolio has been the subject of speculation ahead of the ministerial reshuffle due on Monday.On closing the Indigenous disadvantage gap, Albanese has pointed to Labor’s promise of a comprehensive economic policy as a sign of his intentions. Announced at last year’s Garma festival in Arnhem Land, the plan is designed to boost outside investment and allow developers and job creators to work alongside traditional owners to improve communities in northern Australia and in regional centres. Every government has failed to achieve improvements in Indigenous affairs. Labor has promised to be different.Another difficult but pressing challenge is slowing out-of-control growth in the NDIS, in part by shifting early intervention services for children with autism and developmental conditions back to state and territory government budgets.Growing at about 20% per year, the scheme has become one of the single largest budgetary challenges for Labor, alongside paying interest on government debt. Just a decade old, the $50bn NDIS already costs more to run per year than aged care, Medicare, federal hospitals funding and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.State premiers and disability ministers are unlikely to take on the so-called “foundational support” services without another budget injection from Albanese and Jim Chalmers.Even a casual observer knows that will be difficult. The budget faces long-term structural challenges and federal government debt is due to hit $1tn as soon as September, putting real pressure on the AAA credit rating. Albanese showed no appetite for major reform of the tax or superannuation systems in Canberra this week.Privately, some in Canberra are warning Labor against falling into the trap of hubris from the scale of the election victory. Others note the fragmentation of the primary vote across the country and wild new funding sources slicing and dicing voters at elections means almost anything could happen the next time voters go to the polls.Paul Keating, a past resident of the Lodge, famously said “when you change the government you change the country”. But the reverse can be true as well: keeping the same government gives Labor opportunity to deliver on its promises of long-term reform. But if misunderstood, the election outcome also brings landmark risk.Albanese’s hardest task has only just started.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:00",
            "content": "On a balmy afternoon last month, Amy Tran unboxed a delivery at Yue Wa Market, a small grocery and herbal medicine shop in Los Angeles’s Chinatown that she opened 17 years ago.The package contained two dozen units of Shou Wu Chih, a Chinese herbal concoction known to rebuild kidney function and promote hair health. The shipment arrived two weeks after the US implemented new tariffs on Chinese imports, so her distributor charged her $115, a $35 markup from her previous order.Tran said she had no choice but to increase the retail price from $6 to $7. It’s a steep up-charge for her customers, who are primarily Chinese seniors living off food stamps, some barely able to afford to buy a piece of fresh fruit or vegetable.The tariffs have exacerbated her already dire financial situation. For the past three years, Tran said she had netted no profit, some months not even generating enough sales to cover rent. And she may soon have to raise prices on the dozens of other imported products on her shelves, she said, including an abundance of Asian sauces, dry noodles, ginseng and ointments.But at 58, she sees few other options. “At my age, it’s hard to find work anywhere else,” Tran said in Mandarin. “I’m just taking it day by day.”Donald Trump’s bruising trade war with China poses an existential threat to immigrant-run businesses in Los Angeles’ Chinatown – as well as historic Chinatowns across the country, from New York City to San Francisco – many of which rely heavily on Chinese imports that have few alternatives in the US. As duties on Chinese products rose to 145%, longtime shop owners, who sell everything from jade stones to traditional medicine, say they are bracing for a financial fallout that could compound losses they have been accumulating since the early days of the pandemic.Robert Lee is the third-generation owner of Jin Hing Company, a small jewelry and antiques shop cloistered on Bamboo Lane, a remnant of Old Chinatown. Lee’s father and grandfather opened the shop in 1933, selling imported valuables like jade bracelets and rings, and antiques dating back to the Qing dynasty, such as porcelain snuff bottles and clay teapots.Jin Hing imports jewelry from a Chinese supplier once a quarter, and Lee said there was enough inventory for the next few months. But if the current tariffs hold until the fall, Lee said he’ll have to start sourcing jewelry elsewhere – which will be more cumbersome and expensive.“If we didn’t own the building, we’d be in a lot of trouble,” he said.The tariffs also affect his business on the export end, as US customers often shop for antiques to bring back to China. Since China retaliated with duties of up to 125% on US goods, Lee said demand has dropped.For Lee, 79, the trade war brought back memories of the store’s earlier years. Before President Richard Nixon’s historic China trip in 1972, tariffs were high and trade between the two countries had been very limited. “We couldn’t get anything from China then,” he said, adding that his father could import only from Hong Kong.Community-serving businesses like grocery stores and herbal shops are integral to Chinatown, providing basic goods at low prices to its sizable population of families and seniors, said Laureen Hom, the author of The Power of Chinatown, a close study of the politics that shaped the neighborhood in the early 21st century.“Chinatowns are an ecosystem with a residential, commercial and institutional component that is defined by and serves the Chinese American community,” Hom said. “When one of those components changes, it has a ripple effect on the others.”The business component has been in decline for much of the past decade, with Chinatown’s last full-service grocery store, Ai Hoa Market, shuttering in 2019 after 30 years in operation. The closure of longtime institutions like Empress Pavilion, a banquet hall that drew mammoth lines for its dim sum, drove down foot traffic, which smaller businesses depended on for survival.In addition to a loss of heritage and history, Hom said, the diminishing influence of Chinatown further shrinks housing and employment opportunities for working-class Asian immigrants in LA, an increasingly unaffordable city to live in.“The tariffs add on to the current uncertainties that Chinatown business owners were already facing for several decades,” Hom said, such as “suburban growth, gentrification pressures from downtown and neighboring areas, and the economic downturn and anti-Asian sentiment spurred by the pandemic”.Some 12,000 people live in LA’s Chinatown, about half of whom are Asian. The median household income is roughly $36,000, less than half the countywide average. The Chinese community, though smaller than some other enclaves around LA like Monterey Park and Alhambra, is disproportionately working class and elderly.At the same time, Chinatown has undergone significant demographic changes in recent years, said Eugene Moy, a community historian and member of the Chinese historical society of southern California.As the neighborhood gentrified, Moy said, more affluent residents have moved in, enticed by market-rate apartments and newer, upscale businesses and restaurants that are largely inaccessible to working-class tenants.“There will always be lower-income folks whose incomes cannot keep up with this market economic growth,” Moy said.For Mary Lu Wang, owner of the gift shop Jadetime e-Gifts, these broader demographic changes and continued decline in tourism poses a more immediate threat to her business than the tariffs.Wang, 74, said she used to order new products every month from her brother’s factory in China, but now does it just once a year due to a lack of business. More than a decade ago, she owned three gift shops in Chinatown.She said her shop carries traditional gift items that can’t be found at the dozen other gift shops in Chinatown, like the hand-painted oil paper umbrellas, constructed with bamboo and wood, that are manufactured only at her brother’s factory. She sells them at wholesale prices, but still few are buying.Last Tuesday, Wang made $27 off a couple of umbrellas; the following day, she made $58. A few years ago, she said she often pocketed $400 to $500 a day. If the tariffs stay at their current rate when her inventory runs low, she said she’ll surely have to raise prices – though she’s not losing sleep over it.“What’s the point of fretting about what might happen in the future?” Wang said in Mandarin. “No one’s buying anything now.”",

            "content": "The legality of Queensland’s ban on puberty blockers has been questioned after it was revealed the state government undertook 21 minutes of internal consultation at the same time as a press conference announcing the decision.According to one administrative law expert, an alleged failure to conduct “genuine” consultation could lead to it being overturned in a legal challenge launched this week.Under section 48 of the Hospital and Health Boards Act 2011, the director general of Queensland Health must consult with a service “in developing a health service directive” that applies to it.According to a response by the health minister, Tim Nicholls, to a parliamentary question on notice, that consultation took place from about 10am on 28 January, finishing at 10.21am.The minister announced the government’s decision to implement the directive at a press conference that started at 10.06am.Nicholls announced “an immediate pause on new public patients receiving hormone therapy”.“The government has made these four decisions that I’m announcing today [including the directive],” he said, about 11 minutes into the 24-minute press conference.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe directive bans public facilities from prescribing stage one or stage two hormone therapies. It applies only to transgender children; puberty blockers can still be prescribed for precocious puberty and other conditions.Prof Anthony Cassimatis, the deputy director of the centre for public, international and comparative law at the University of Queensland, said similar decisions had been quashed in the past for lack of genuine consultation because the time involved was so short.He pointed to the case of Carrascalao v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. In that case, the decision maker cancelled a visa after about four hours’ consideration. “The federal court didn’t like that,” Cassimatis said. “They thought that that can’t have been genuine consideration to have happened so quickly.”The circumstances relating to the health directive “would appear to be even more dramatic than that”, he said.“Parliament has required the decision maker to consider [the advice provided during the consultation] and that needs to be consideration in some meaningful sense,” Cassimatis said.The health minister revealed the consultation timeline on 1 May, in a response to a parliamentary question on notice by Greens MP Michael Berkman.“Prior to issuing the directive, the chief executive formally consulted with all hospital and health service chief executives,” Nicholls said in his response.“A meeting was scheduled from 10:00am on Tuesday 28 January 2025 and I am advised that it concluded at 10:21am. The health service directive was shared, read through in detail and discussed collectively at the meeting.”Sign up to Morning MailOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionAccording to documents obtained by Guardian Australia under right to information laws, the minister was sent a version of a press release announcing the decision the previous day, Monday 27 January, at 4.34pm.Berkman said the governmenthad clearly made its decision before the 21-minute consultation was finished.A legal challenge against the decision by the mother of a transgender child was launched this week by the LGBTI Legal Service.Matilda Alexander, a spokesperson for the service, said the timing of the consultation meeting would become part of its lawsuit.A spokesperson for Nicholls said: “As the matter is the subject of a legal action currently in the supreme court, it is inappropriate to comment further.”The director general of health was also asked for comment, and responded: “As the matter is the subject of a legal action currently in the supreme court, it is inappropriate to comment further.”According to his statement of reasons filed in the case, the Queensland health director general, David Rosengren, made two “minor refinements” to the directive as a result of the consultation.The directive was issued at 11.07am on January 28 and published online.The ban on puberty blockers will remain in effect until the completion of a study by psychiatrist Dr Ruth Vine. It is due to be completed by 30 November.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 16:00",
            "content": "They might not produce Gershwin hits, but chimpanzees have got rhythm, researchers have found in a study they say sheds light on the evolutionary origins of music.Scientists have previously found chimpanzees drum on the buttress roots of trees to send information to each other, with each individual having their own signature style.However, it remained unclear whether the chimpanzees drummed rhythmically.Now researchers say they have not only found chimpanzees drum with non-random timing, but that the rhythms differ between subspecies.The team said the revelations shed light on the evolutionary origins of a feature that sits at the heart of human social behaviour, from conversation to music-making.“[The findings] are a strong suggester that those building blocks [of rhythm] that we have then used in all of our social behaviour and all of our music were present way back in our last common ancestor,” said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a senior author of the work from the University of St Andrews.The study, published in the journal Current Biology and led by PhD student Vesta Eleuteri, reveals how the team studied 371 drumming bouts produced by 47 chimpanzees acrosssix populations from two subspecies – eastern and western chimpanzees.The team compared the drumming with random patterns of beats, revealing all the chimpanzees showed non-random timing.“It had a predictability to it. And when you’ve got predictability, you’ve got a really strong indicator that there’s rhythm there,” said Hobaiter.The researchers then compared the drumming of the two subspecies, finding western chimpanzees drummed with evenly spaced intervals between beats – like the tick of a clock – while eastern chimpanzees alternated between shorter and longer intervals, resulting in a swing-like beat.However, western chimpanzees use more hits in their drumming than eastern chimpanzees, despite the bouts lasting for the same duration, suggesting they drum with a faster tempo.In addition, the eastern and western chimpanzees drummed at different points when making what are known as “pant-hoot” calls.The researchers say it is unclear why the subspecies drum with different rhythms, noting it does not appear to be down to ecological factors.“If you’ve got an itty bitty root or an amazing rainforest tree and you’re from west Africa, you’ll drum more similarly to each other than a chimp from west Africa in the rainforest and a chimp from east Africa in a rainforest,” said Hobaiter.Instead, she said it might be associated with societal differences, noting eastern chimpanzees are more violent towards each other – or that chimpanzees in east Africa need to share more detailed information with each other.“When you’ve got more variable intervals – those long, short, long shorts – you might be able to encode a bit more information in there, in the same way as you could with morse code rather than if you had only a sort of ticking clock sound,” Hobaiter said.Hobaiter added that while chimpanzees were not producing human-like musical rhythms, their drumming shared some of its fundamental properties, pushing back the evolutionary origins of music by several million years.“Before humans were human – six, seven million years ago – the apes that were roaming around that eventually would evolve into chimpanzees and humans probably had some basic building blocks of rhythm,” she said.",

            "content": "The loss of Adam Bandt’s seat of Melbourne is a disaster for the Greens, but not for the reasons you might think.In his 15 years in parliament, Bandt showed how the Greens could break into the House of Representatives, and that achievement in itself distinguished the party from forerunners the Democrats.Bandt built on that achievement as leader of the parliamentary party over the last five years, overseeing the historic 2022 result in which the Greens had 12 senators and four MPs.It was always something of an aberration for the Greens to suddenly jag three seats in inner Brisbane in 2022. Historically, Queensland has been the toughest of all states for the Greens. So it was always possible or even likely that there would be some form of correction at the federal level in 2025. The loss of the state seat of South Brisbane in October’s poll signalled a swing against the party was on the cards.At a national level, it was easy to imagine that there might be a backlash against the Greens this election. Under Bandt’s leadership, and through the last parliamentary term, the party has veered left and played hardball with Labor on a string of controversial policy positions.Courting controversy is unsurprising for a protest party, and very often the Greens’ positions (if not their tactics) were principled and defensible. What is unarguable is that this year the Greens have been the focus of a determined and effective campaign from Advance Australia and other third-party lobby groups in part on their views on Gaza.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailSo it was easy to see how the Greens vote might soften, nationally, and how they might lose ground in Brisbane. I saw no suggestion, anywhere in the lead-up to the campaign, that Bandt’s own seat was vulnerable.True, an adverse redistribution last year made Melbourne harder for Bandt to win, shaving his margin by more than 3%. If not for the redistribution, Bandt may well have won.But that’s no excuse: with his personal standing and knowledge of the electorate, Bandt should have been able to win Melbourne a sixth time. Big picture, my understanding is that the Greens felt Labor was on the nose in Victoria. As it happens, as Bandt said in his concession speech on Thursday, Melbourne voters swung overwhelmingly to Labor, determined to “keep Dutton out”.Bandt’s loss in Melbourne has ushered in a rush of commentary that the 2025 election shows his leadership has been a disaster for the party, and the Greens should go back to being a party of the environment focused on winning the balance of power in the Senate. That’s a gross misread.In my 2019 book Inside the Greens, I tried to show how the Greens represented the coming together of different activist strands – the environment movement in Tasmania, the nuclear disarmament movement in WA, the socialist left in New South Wales – around a policy platform based on the four pillars established by Germany’s Die Gruenen in the early 1980s: ecological sustainability, social justice, peace and disarmament, and grassroots democracy.The party’s foundational and spiritual leader, Bob Brown, kicked off his political career as a No Dams campaigner for the Wilderness Society but doubled the Greens vote in 2001 by taking a principled stand on the Tampa affair, and fought tirelessly against the Iraq war, and for gay rights. The party may have been environment-first, but it has never been environment-only.Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotionBrown was effectively leader of the Greens for 20 years, until he retired in 2012. But he was aware that in winning the balance of power in the Senate, the Greens were only replicating the strategy of the Democrats, whose mantra was to “keep the bastards honest”.Brown believed the Greens were not just there to keep the bastards honest, “we’re there to replace the bastards”. That hasn’t happened, and it may never happen, but given the party’s track record and level of representation at the local, state and territory, and federal level – making it the most successful third party in Australian political history (if you count the Coalition as one) – it is unlikely that the Greens are going to give up.Winning 10% of the vote to gain 10% of the seats under proportional representation is fine for politicians content to shout at the government in the Senate. It takes a different type of politics to win lower house seats, and the Greens now have a taste of it. Up against both major parties, winning lower house seats means aiming to win more than 50% of voters in your own right and that’s a lot harder.When I interviewed Bandt in 2016 for Inside the Greens, he explained why winning lower house seats meant embracing a different approach to politics, and how he had pioneered it in Melbourne. If you want action on climate change, Bandt said, rather than lecturing voters on climate, Greens politicians should do more listening, and take on board their concerns about unaffordable housing, the high cost of university degrees, and insecure work.“It’s time to take those issues and treat them with the respect that they deserve … And then you work out a way of linking those various campaigns, to the point where people are more willing to hear your message about climate change because they know that you’re fighting for affordable housing. We’ve done a micro version of that in Melbourne over the last six years, to the point where people who never would have thought about voting for the Greens now see us as the people that are there campaigning with them and so they’re more prepared to trust us or work with us come election time.”Bandt succeeded for many years, but has lost out now. That’s a disaster if the party genuinely aspires to be a party of government, alongside Labor, as it has become a junior partner in coalitions with social democratic parties in other countries like New Zealand and Germany, and here in the ACT and Tasmania.There is more at stake for the Greens, in Bandt’s defeat, than just one seat, and in time – after a well-earned break – perhaps the best way for Bandt to prove his point is to try to win Melbourne back.Paddy Manning is an independent journalist and author of Inside the Greens: The Origins and Future of the Party, the People and the Politics (Black Inc, 2019)",

            "content": "TV advertising continues to rack up large bills for political parties during federal election campaigns but third-party interest groups are increasingly using social media to deliver targeted messages to voters.With multiple seats determined by very fine margins, targeted messaging can sway just enough to influence a third-party group’s preferred outcome.At least, that’s what some campaigners tell their financial backers.A Guardian Australia analysis of social media advertising of 15 interest groups across the political spectrum showed more than $7m was spent on ads on YouTube, Meta and Google search over the five-week campaign.Of that figure, at least $1.6m was spent on 30 of the most hotly-contested seats.The marketing professor Andrew Hughes said third-party ads could subtly influence voters but success varies wildly.Voter attitudes toward both the brand and the ad’s content matter, Hughes said.“Third-party advertising is really handy for a major party because they add credibility and authenticity to a message,” he said. “But if you don’t like the brand, it doesn’t work.”While unions have long been a part of the election campaign advertising fabric, they no longer occupy the space alone.The rightwing activist group Advance has emerged in recent years as a powerful fundraising force, banking $15.6m in donations during the 2023-24 financial year.Analysis of data collected by the Populares ad tracker showed Advance spent $1.7m in social media advertising across its various Facebook pages and $239,300 of that was targeted at its key seats.Its efforts focused most intensely on seats where the Greens had a chance at winning, including Brisbane, Macnamara, Griffith, Ryan and Wills.“We have destroyed the Greens,” an Advance spokesperson told Guardian Australia.“In every seat we targeted, the Greens have suffered terminal declines in their primary votes.”The Greens’ primary vote in Brisbane, Macnamara, Griffith and Ryan did fall slightly in the 2025 poll. However, it increased by 2% in Wills.Despite Advance’s claims to have played a role in unseating the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, the data showed no social media advertising was targeted specifically at his Melbourne seat.A number of other right-leaning groups joined the fray in recent months, including Better Australia and J-United, which both targeted Greens and teal independents.Ad tracking data showed Better Australia spent $373,209 on social media advertising during the campaign. Almost $33,000 was spent on geo-targeted ads focused on Goldstein, Bradfield, Curtin, Brisbane, Ryan and Wills.Another new entrant was the anti-Greens and anti-teals group Australians for Prosperity, which spent $414,903 on online ads.The group’s spokesperson, Jason Falinski, said its campaign focus was economic issues and to target inner-city seats previously dominated by the Liberals.Falinski, a former Liberal MP who was unseated by the teal independent Sophie Scamps, said he didn’t want to “waste” money on Anthony Albanese’s seat in Sydney’s inner west.Its targeted ads hit the Greens seat of Brisbane as well as Bradfield and Bennelong in Sydney, and Bruce, McEwen and Aston in Victoria.The Australian Taxpayers’ Alliance spent $597,758 on ads, targeting marginal Labor seats in Aston, Dobell, Dunkley, Gilmore and Roberston along with Deakin, where shadow minister Michael Sukkar lost his seat to Labor.Left-leaning groups also racked up big social media advertising bills.The Australian Unions and United Workers Union together spent $1.85m with $826,597 going toward geo-targeted social media ads on YouTube and Meta.The Australian Unions spent more than $50,000 per seat on geo-targeted ads in some electorates, including Bruce, Dunkley, McEwen, Chisholm, Hawke, Blair, Bennelong and Tangney.A little-known climate change interest group, Hothouse Magazine, spent close to a $500,000 on social media advertising.Focusing on seats such as Goldstein, Curtin, Bradfield, Dickson and Cowper, where it spent around $36,000 on targeted ads, a spokesperson said “the election was the perfect opportunity to fire up the engine and have a crack at making an impact”.The new entrant gained notoriety for linking Peter Dutton to Donald Trump, including corflutes depicting the opposition leader with Trump’s signature blonde combover.Other pro-climate groups, such as Solutions for Climate Australia, It’s Not a Race and Clean Energy Council, spent more than $200,000 on social media ads.Still, the numbers fall well short of the major parties, who collectively spent more than $29m across the sites.Labor took the lead with $17.6m in spending, with the Liberals trailing on $10.8m and the Nationals on $650,000.While the data shows third-party interest groups aren’t afraid to spend millions online to influence voters, does it actually shift the dial?The campaigners say yes.Advance’s spokesperson described its campaign as a success after the Greens’ lower house losses.“We ran the biggest third-party campaign ever seen at an Australian election against the Greens,” they said.“For more than a year, we delivered millions of ads across TV, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram as well as millions of flyers distributed in target electorates. We ran ads on billboards, bus shelters, mobile trucks and delivered an on-the-ground field campaign during the election.”Similarly, Hothouse said its messaging was “impressively influential” in taking aim at their right-leaning counterparts.“Sure, money can buy people’s attention, and if you slap them in the face enough with a message it’ll stick,” a spokesperson said.“But our content actually had some personality with a priority to inform rather than manipulate – a novel concept in this space that helped us punch above our weight.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFalinski also said Australians for Prosperity would take credit if Gisele Kapterian is successful in overcoming her teal challenger, Nicolette Boele, in Bradfield.“The one thing I have learned is never, never be shy about claiming something,” Falinski joked.But claiming a win directly off the back of online campaigns is dubious, Hughes said.“I think it’s very dubious to claim that you’ve got that correlation effect happening. You say ‘they didn’t get elected, therefore the advertising worked’. Well, maybe yes and maybe no, because unless you do the real causation studies, which are things like recall, it’s very, very hard to discern,” he said.With thousands of online ads fighting for eyeballs, Hughes said voter fatigue would have limited the success of most ads unless they could capture a voter’s attention for at least two seconds.The quality and simplicity of the content was key, he said, but the brand associated with it mattered too. For example, Hughes said, Advance has more visibility as an anti-Labor and anti-Greens group and therefore its messages were unlikely to resonate with progressive or left-leaning voters.Given Hothouse’s relatively low-level brand recognition, Hughes said its ads linking Dutton to Trump would likely have planted the seed in some audiences. And it did that with less than a third of Advance’s budget.“That’s the power of social media, really. In a nutshell, it’s a subtle effect, it’s a lag effect. And it’s an effect based on your [perception] of the content,” Hughes said.While the money third-party campaign groups spent on social media advertising paled in comparison to major parties, Hughes said their impact in future elections shouldn’t be written off just yet.“When you feel part of a group, you’re more likely to conform to the group’s behaviours and vote for the way the group is leaning towards, and that’s where the impact is,” he said.",

            "content": "The Vaucluse foreshore is the sort of place you go to forget your problems. In this quiet pocket of Sydney’s eastern suburbs, trees form a protective canopy overhead, tiny beaches interrupt the bush, and the harbour unfurls across the horizon in all its glory. It is here, on a dazzlingly bright blue day, that Sarah Wilson is telling me there can be no hope for the future.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.For the last three years, Wilson has been researching and writing a book on systems collapse, the first chapter of which is called Hope – about “how there is no hope, and we need to face this”.As we make our way along the walking track here, Wilson takes me through what she has learned. In short: every single – “every single, without exception” – complex civilisation from the Roman and Maya empires to Easter Island, ends up collapsing, generally within 250 to 300 years. Our post-industrial civilisation is now at 270 years and that, coupled with the escalating climate crisis and a host of other factors, suggests, she thinks, that our own collapse is imminent. The interconnected nature of the globalised world means that once one of the systems starts to fail, the rest will domino.“It’s not a matter of may or may not happen,” she says. “It will happen. It’s just a matter of the speed at which it’ll happen.”Despite the nature of the topic she’s here to talk about, Wilson is peppy and upbeat, still bearing the sunny disposition that made her a TV host in a past life. She’s dressed in colourful activewear, appropriate for our walk but also one of the few outfits she had in her suitcase during her return visit to Australia. Wilson moved to Paris two years ago on an artist’s visa to work on her book. The topic of collapsology is one the French are “really on top of” – collapse experts there do morning TV, and books on the subject top bestseller charts, making it a more fitting place to get to work than Sydney. “It’s a topic that I would say Australians are just not alive to yet,” she sighs.Wilson has taken something of a roundabout path to the topic of systems collapse. In the 2000s she spent nearly five years as the editor of women’s magazine Cosmopolitan, before becoming a wellness columnist and the host of a show called Eat Yourself Sexy. In 2013 she wrote a recipe book called I Quit Sugar that became a cultural phenomenon and grew into a business employing over 20 staff – only for Wilson to walk away from it all five years later. She sold I Quit Sugar, gave the proceeds to charity and wrote two very contemplative books, one about her lifelong struggle with anxiety and the other about living hopefully amid the climate crisis.Going from diet to mental health to climate and collapse “makes sense” to Wilson, because she feels she has always delved into spaces that hadn’t been properly investigated, which at the time included the sugar industry. Now, though, she regards her stint as an accidental wellness hero with a shrug.“I did it and I wanted to get out, so that’s why I sold it and gave all the money away: I didn’t want to keep doing it,” she says. “That’s not my thing. I don’t like making money.”And she’s not fond of where wellness culture has gone since her departure.“It’s narcissism,” she says with the roll of an eye. “Worrying about your gut biome when the world’s burning is too indulgent … I think it’s particularly rampant in Australia, where the opulence is such that that’s what people now spend their time doing.”Today, Wilson says, she doesn’t own furniture or a car, doesn’t “buy stuff” and largely lives out of a suitcase. Anxiety remains something she has to actively manage, including by regularly getting into nature on hikes like the one we’re on today. Perhaps paradoxically, what’s most helped her anxiety is delving into the subject of systems collapse. Anxious people, she says, feel at a visceral level “that something’s not quite right”. Researching this topic has been a salve that’s proven, well, something isn’t right – and has brought her its own kind of peace.Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningWilson found her way to the field of collapse after she finished her 2020 book on climate – and then watched in growing horror at the continued inaction on the crisis. Then came the failed voice referendum, the acceleration of AI, dialled-up nuclear threat, the Doomsday Clock ticking ever closer to midnight and, later, the return of Donald Trump. She realised “the problem was way bigger than climate” and began reading about systems collapse. “Once I dug into that, I couldn’t unsee it,” Wilson says.\n  While it may be at the extreme end of the spectrum, collapse theory – and it is, at this point, just a theory – is not out of step with growing global concern about what the future holds for the planet. The precarious position of our global systems is an alarm academics and scientists have been sounding in recent years – one analysis of population sustainability from 2020 put the chance of catastrophic collapse at 90% or more – but it is a topic that’s often communicated about in complex, inaccessible terms. Wilson wanted to write a book that would help everyday people navigate impending collapse, “while being really clear that there’s no fix for this”.To get her words out there as quickly as possible, she opted to eschew traditional publishing and instead serialised the book chapter by chapter on her Substack, where she now has 60,000 subscribers (the actor Liam Neeson, who likes Wilson’s ideas, is one of them). All 100,000 words are available there now. After Trump’s re-election, Penguin US bought the world rights and will publish it in a “hold-in-your-hands” format – “but I guess it remains to be seen whether there’ll be bookshops left by the time it comes out,” Wilson shrugs matter-of-factly.But despite being about the end of the world as we know it, the book is not all doom and gloom. Wilson thinks that breaking up with hope, as she has, can actually be an invitation to live in the here and now.“Really, nothing changes, because none of us know when we’re gonna die. And that’s the absolute absurdity of our existence,” she says, as casually as one might recount the weather. “So it’s really an invitation to live fully – not narcissistically, and not nihilistically – but as beautifully and as fully human as we can, because that is what brings us our greatest happiness.”With Wilson leading the charge, we have now power-walked our way back to her hire car (the “most economical” way of getting around while she’s in town, despite her misgivings about its environmental impact), which is parked opposite a school. Before she has to dart off to her next appointment, I’m eager to find out where Wilson sees the world in 50 years.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotion“Oh boy,” she exhales. “I’m very careful not to put predictions on this, and I’m very careful to say to people, anyone who says they know what’s going to happen, don’t believe it, because the point – we are in abject uncertainty. That’s the actual nub of all of this.”But basically, she says, it will be “the shittification of life. Things are going to get more and more shitty.”A best-case scenario, Wilson feels, would be massive population decline and an extreme gap between the haves and have-nots. “The billionaire set will probably be in bunkers”, and the rest of us will have to learn to use remaining resources in cooperative ways. To that end, Wilson recommends what she calls pro-social prepping. “Form communities. Get to know your neighbours – you are going to have to rely on them. Going forward, you’re going to have to share things.”You don’t need to hoard canned corn, she says, but it might pay to try to get used to a life without technology.“It brings me no joy to say this,” Wilson adds. “I’m devastated. I accept it, and I’m prepared for it … But I’m devastated for young people. It’s not their fault.”As if on cue, the moment these words leave her mouth, the school opposite us begins playing a sombre piece of music over its PA system, before a choir of students join in song. It is a too-perfect, movie-scene moment and Wilson can respond only by laughing. “Hilarious!” she says, throwing her hands in the air.But Wilson is keen to point out that she doesn’t think all this means we should stop having children. That’s for the same reason she thinks we should keep being climate activists, keep standing up for Gaza, and keep creating art: we must keep being human.“We are going to be forced into grounding into our full humanity, because it’s the only thing we’re going to have left,” she says, the choir of schoolchildren still singing behind her, and the bright blue sky taunting with its beauty.“We should be fighting for humanity and for human values, because the dispiritedness, the moral injury of not doing that, will destroy us faster than any other kind of thing. It’ll produce massive unrest and despair at a level that we can’t fathom.“So, yes. We fight because this is what we do.”Sarah Wilson will be appearing as part of the Melbourne writers festival on 10 May. The festival runs until 11 May",

            "content": "Success for Western United’s ambitious part-football, part-real estate project will not be determined for a decade or more, but powerful young striker Noah Botić showed he is a man of the present with a hat-trick in a 3-2 A-League Men elimination final victory over Adelaide on Friday.Financial uncertainty has swirled around the club in recent weeks, and the visiting Reds shocked the small yet passionate crowd of 3,080 at Ironbark Fields with an early goal through Luka Jovanović.But in front of Socceroos assistant Hayden Foxe, Botić scored twice in the first half and once in the second to keep Western United’s season alive and make his case for Australian selection.The 23-year-old said he was just focusing on playing for Western United at the moment, but it would be “special” to receive a call-up. “If that call comes, then obviously I’m going to be extremely happy and proud to represent my country,” he said.Botić’s three goals take him to 15, two more than the next highest scorer in the A-League Men. His coach and former Socceroos striker John Aloisi said a senior call-up is inevitable if he keeps improving.“I keep on saying that eventually Noah will become a Socceroo but we know, and I think Noah knows, there’s still a lot of improvement, so he just needs to keep on improving like he’s going and then eventually the call-up will come.”The resounding victory sets up a two-legged semi-final against crosstown rivals Melbourne City, with both legs to be held at AAMI Park. Botić picked up a knock to the quad on Friday, but was confident he would take part next week.The prolific youngster remains unsigned next season and is almost certain to move overseas, meaning Friday was likely to be his final game at Ironbark Fields. “I’m not going to say too much, but if it was, it’s been a pleasure playing here, especially in front of these fans,” he said.Like that of their star striker, Western United’s future is far from certain. There is much to like about the long-term strategy of basing a club in the booming suburbs to the west of Melbourne.But there are fears that the footballing entity – which is part of a larger property development working with Wyndham city council – might not last until the promise that secured one of the A-League’s expansion berths in 2018 can be realised.Supporters still dream of a privately-owned stadium, filled with those from Melbourne’s multicultural west watching local talent dominate the A-League, but that vision remains some way off.The club’s cash-flow challenges are obvious. Crowds this season are the lowest in the league at 3,644 on average, and players were late in getting paid last month.Western United is subject to a winding up application from the Australian Taxation Office and other creditors, including the commissioner of state revenue, a web design company and the local licence-holder of Kappa, the manufacturer of the team’s playing strips. That matter is due to be heard later this month.In this context, the announcement a week ago of investment by the KAM Sports group of Maciek Kaminski and his son Mikhail – Americans who have built wealth in real estate – is significant. The level of investment reportedly is around $100m, which would help meet Western United’s debts.But the deal – as noted by APL chair Stephen Conroy in the release – remains “pending”, and is subject to “successful completion of the necessary approval processes by Wyndham city, the APL and regulatory processes by Football Australia”.While many in the football community have hailed the announcement as good news, others have been more cautious. The Kaminskis were reportedly set to buy Belgian club KV Kortrijk in 2023, but the deal never eventuated.Professional Footballers Association chief executive, Beau Busch, is hopeful the investment secures Western United’s future, but wants to ensure it is “subject to a thorough and transparent due diligence process” – including by his own organisation – to ensure the best interests of the players, and the integrity of the competition, are upheld.“Our clubs are operating in arguably the world’s toughest and most competitive sports market in the world, as such we need to be clear on the fundamentals that are required to succeed,” he said.Busch cited clubs such as Western Sydney, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Auckland who have strong backing, a clear market demand, the right match day infrastructure, and ambition to grow and build something for the local community.“We’ve seen it time and again over the past 20 years,” he said. “Clubs that fail on one or more of these fundamentals have been unable to succeed and have dragged the league down as well.”Of these four clubs, all but Sydney are taking part in the A-League Men finals, which continue on Saturday with another elimination clash between Western Sydney Wanderers and Melbourne Victory. The winner of that match meets premiers Auckland in a two-legged semi-final.",

            "content": "Late-night hosts reacted to Donald Trump’s trade deal with the UK getting upstaged by the announcement of the first American pope, Leo XIV.Thursday was an “exciting day for Catholics and for America”, said Jimmy Kimmel that evening, as Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost was elected the new pope. “Against all odds, he is one of us. An American pope,” Kimmel marveled. “The pope-mobile is now a Ford F-250 with truck nuts.”“I’m actually surprised at how excited I was when I heard this,” he continued. “An American who grew up here, watched all the shows we watched, rooted for teams is now in Rome at the head of the church. Italy and America – this must’ve been what it felt like when they opened the first Olive Garden.”While Trump said publicly that he looked forward to meeting the new pope, who took the name Leo XIV, Kimmel was dubious. “Wait till he finds out how many times this pope has criticized him,” he said. “Rightwing media is losing its collective mind because the new pope cares for the poor and the sick and the plight of immigrants, and they don’t like that at all.”Rightwing outrage aside, “what a historic era we are in,” Kimmel said. “We have an American pope and a Russian president. Isn’t it incredible?”Meanwhile, in Washington, Trump boasted about a trade deal with the UK after the chaos from his tariffs. “Only 180 countries to go,” Kimmel laughed. “He is very proud of himself for making a trade agreement with a country we were trading with just fine until he screwed it all up.”“The Vatican’s got that new pope smell!” cheered Stephen Colbert on the Late Show just hours after the news that Robert Francis Prevost would become the first American pope. “The thing about becoming pope is that you also have to leave your old name behind,” said Colbert, “which works out great for him, because I’m pretty sure Prevost is also the name of a weight loss medication.”Prevost chose the name Pope Leo XIV, “in honor of t Leonardo of Caprio”, Colbert quipped.Colbert was especially excited that Prevost was raised in Chicago, “which means I can no longer imitate the pope using an Italian accent”, he explained, shifting course to a midwest accent. “From now on, the pope is going to sound like this: ‘Hey there, it’s your buddy Leo. The deep dish Papa. Just talked to God, and not even he can help the White Sox, sorry. First order of business, I’ll be canonizing Michael Jordan. Now, let’s end by saying daaaaaaa prayers.’”Hours before the Vatican announcement, there was a false alarm when, on the second vote, the smoke briefly appeared white but two seconds later, was very clearly black. “I’m just going to say it: that system is too ambiguous for the modern world,” said Colbert. “Don’t reveal the pope via smoke. It’s 2025. You reveal him via cake. It’s a pope reveal party – if it’s a blue cake, it’s a boy pope, and if it’s a pink cake, it’s also a boy pope. It’s always going to be a boy pope.”And Colbert was most excited about the fact that Prevost once criticized JD Vance, the vice-president, on Twitter, posting: “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”“Holy Father, you had me at JD Vance is wrong,” said Colbert.“You know Trump is going to try to claim credit for this,” said Seth Meyers of the first American pope. “‘The tariffs are working! We’re picking our own popes now right in America. We’re going to reopen the pope factories.’”The Vatican’s announcement occurred just after Trump tried to claim the spotlight with his new UK trade deal. “Not only was Trump upstaged by a new pope, but he was upstaged by a new pope who has amplified criticisms of Trump’s immigration policies on Twitter,” the Late Night host explained.In February, Prevost responded to Vance, a practicing Catholic, for using Catholicism to justify deportations. Prevost reposted an article with the caption: “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”“JD Vance is zero for two on popes,” Meyers laughed. “He grim-reapered the last one, he got dunked on by this one. That’s how you know the new pope is from Chicago. You know, the pope is supposed to love everyone, but even this guy is like, ‘Hey, JD can kiss my ass.’”The Vatican chooses the first American pope, and as an American, Desi wonders: Are you sure about this? pic.twitter.com/tnDPpV8DxuAnd on the Daily Show, Desi Lydic was skeptical about the first American pope. “As an American, are you sure about this?” she warned. “We don’t really have the gravitas that you associate with pope-iness. We’re less somber procession and more monster truck rally.“I just think it’s a little bit weird that the holiest man in the world probably knows all the words to the Chilis’ baby back ribs song,” she added.“Of course, the first job of every new pope is to pick a pope name, which we all know is supposed to be the name of your first pet and the street you grew up on,” she continued. “But he went a different way,” becoming Pope Leo XIV. “Leo the 14th? Did he choose it the way we pick a new email address?” Lydic wondered. “Desi.Lydic is taken? OK, what about Desi.Lydic2? Really? Three? Four? Fine – Desi.Lydic14.“I’ve always found this odd – the church is conservative on gay issues, but then they turn around and make its leader choose a drag name,” Lydic quipped. “And make it quick! We’ve got to get you to your gown fitting, you’re going to look so fierce.”She also mocked conservative outlets who immediately took issue with Pope Leo XIV’s address to the people in Vatican square, in which he spoke Spanish and Italian, but not English.“Yes, how dare you,” Lydic joked. “If English was good enough for Jesus, it’s good enough for the pope!”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/09/aesc-second-sunderland-gigafactory-after-securing-funding-government-battery-maker",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 15:54",
            "content": "The owner of the UK’s only operating gigafactory has secured £1bn in funding for a new electric car battery plant in Sunderland, in a government-backed deal that secures the future of a key project for the struggling British car industry.The funding will allow Japan’s AESC to install tooling and start production of batteries at the site, which is being built to serve Nissan’s car factory down the road. More than 1,000 people are expected to be employed there.The National Wealth Fund and UK Export Finance, both state bodies, will provide financial guarantees that unlock £680m in financing for the battery maker. A further £320m in debt funding will come from private financing as well as new equity from the business.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who was in Sunderland for the announcement, said the deal would boost British industries’ resilience and encourage growth. “This investment in Sunderland will not only further innovation and accelerate our move to more sustainable transport, but it will also deliver much-needed high quality, well-paid jobs to the north-east,” she said.AESC already owns a Sunderland factory capable of making car batteries with cumulative capacity of 1.8 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year. The existing gigafactory supplied batteries for Nissan’s electric Leaf.The Japan-based, part-Chinese-owned company, formerly known as Envision, first announced a huge expansion plan in 2021 to as much as 38GWh, in two phases.However, the project has not proceeded as quickly as planned, and has been scaled back from those aggressive predictions as carmakers have come up against slower-than-expected growth in demand for electric cars. The first phase of building is now expected to be capable of 15.8GWh of batteries a year, enough for about 300,000 electric cars. The plant will supply the new version of Nissan’s Leaf.A second phase of building has not proceeded beyond the feasibility study stage.The funding for AESC to proceed with the first phase will be a relief for the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, who was born near Sunderland. He described the investment as “yet another vote of confidence in the north-east’s thriving auto manufacturing hub”.The news came just a day after the UK and the US agreed a trade deal that dramatically reduced Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports of cars, as well as aluminium and steel.The US has agreed to cut the tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars to 10%, down from the 27.5% rate Trump initially announced. The US is the main export market for British cars, worth more than £9bn in 2024.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionKeir Starmer, appearing at a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands on Thursday, said the deal would protect British businesses and “save thousands of jobs”.The new AESC plant in Sunderland is expected to be able to provide up to 15.8GWh battery supply when it operates at full capacity. That will represent an increase of almost six times on the current level of UK gigafactory capacity.The National Wealth Fund’s financial guarantee to AESC will replace an initial £200m short-term bridging loan that it announced in January 2024, before it transitioned from UK Infrastructure Bank to its current structure.The fund, which was launched by Reeves last year, is designed to help projects such as ports, gigafactories, hydrogen and steel. The Leeds-based fund has £27.8bn that it can use to offer loans and make equity investments and financial guarantees.",

With lots to consider, view me as your guide as you trek through the process of picking the best handset for you.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.The latest flagship Android phones come in various sizes, at different prices, and with varying hardware and software features, all powered by the fastest chips. Whether your priority is battery life, camera, screen size, software support or value for money, there is more to choose from than ever. But if you’re thinking of buying Apple instead, we have a guide for iPhones, too.Best Android for most people: \n    Google Pixel 9 £621.96 at AmazonBest Android for camera: \n    Google Pixel 9 ProFrom £999 at Carphone WarehouseBest Android for battery life and big screen:Samsung Galaxy S25 UltraFrom £1,099 at SamsungBest small Android:\n    Samsung Galaxy S25From £699 at SamsungBest value Android: \n    Google Pixel 9a£499 at John LewisNew models typically have faster chips and better cameras, but the differences between generations are shrinking with each year. That means the best Android phone might be the one already in your hand.If your battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, replacements are often available from the manufacturer or third parties, and start at about £50, depending on the make and model. If your Android is slow or apps won’t install, check you have enough free storage – ideally at least 2GB. Space can be freed up by uninstalling unused apps or content, clearing out your messaging storage, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music and podcasts you no longer listen to.If your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. Most older Androids received only three years of software support from release date – not from purchase – with newer, better models getting five to seven years. Replacing a phone that has stopped receiving security updates is essential because it will be more vulnerable to hackers and cybercriminals.£749 at John Lewis£621.96 at AmazonIt’s not the biggest or equipped with the most cameras, but the Google Pixel 9 strikes a great balance between design, price, size, features and camera quality.The device has a modern, premium look, IP68 water resistance and Google’s standout camera design on the back. A sharp and sufficiently sized 6.3in OLED screen makes content look great, and its 120Hz refresh rate keeps scrolling smooth. Unlocking the phone is easy, with the fast and reliable ultrasonic fingerprint scanner under the display and improved 2D face unlock that uses the selfie camera.The Pixel 9 has 12GB of RAM and the same top Tensor G4 chip as Google’s most expensive models, remaining snappy and responsive. The battery lasts about two days between charges with light use or at least a day of navigating, photos and media. It comes with a decent 128GB of storage, and a 256GB model is available if you need more.The phone runs some of the best software and will get the latest and therefore most secure versions of Android faster than its rivals, thanks to monthly updates until at least August 2031.Most of Google’s AI features come as standard on the Pixel 9. That includes free access to the impressive Gemini Live assistant, the handy Pixel Screenshots app, and various writing and summarisation tools. It also has advanced AI image editing in Google Photos, and the popular Best Take and Add Me group-shot camera features.The dual rear camera is among the best in the business, making the most of shots with little effort. Super closeups are a breeze for its microphotography mode, and there’s 2x magnification on the main sensor. But the Pixel 9 lacks a real telephoto lens, which is its biggest downside – along with the price creeping up from previous versions.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 9 is the sweet spot for eye-catching design, premium build, performance, AI features and longevity – plus it costs less than other models with more cameras or bigger screens.Buy if: you want the premium, AI-packed Android experience with top-tier speed and featuresDon’t buy if: you want the best camera zoom or a massive screenRead our full Google Pixel 9 review: a good phone overshadowed by great onesScreen: 6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor: Google Tensor G4RAM: 12GBStorage: 128 or 256GBTested battery life (with overnight standby): 50 hoursCamera: 50MP, 48MP ultrawide, 10.5MP selfieWater resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions: 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mmWeight: 198gFrom £999 at Carphone WarehouseFrom £1,099 at John LewisThe Pixel 9 Pro takes everything good about Google’s regular Pixel 9 and adds a class-leading 5x telephoto camera to the back.The 6.3in OLED screen is slightly brighter than its cheaper sibling, rivalling the very best in the business. The frosted glass back and polished aluminium sides look and feel expensive, while the fingerprint and face scanners work great. The Tensor G4 chip is backed by a plentiful 16GB of RAM, keeping things smooth and enabling the latest AI tools, all while maintaining a solid two-day battery life.The excellent main and ultrawide cameras from the Pixel 9 are joined by one of the best 5x telephoto cameras on the market, which has an in-sensor zoom for an effective 10x optical magnification. The Pixel 9 Pro makes getting the shot across various lighting conditions and environments easier than any other, plus it has plenty of useful AI tools to boot and – weirdly – a thermometer on the back.Long software support until at least August 2031, access to all of Google’s most advanced local and cloud-based AI features, and its manageable size make the Pixel 9 Pro very hard to beat.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 9 Pro has one of the very best cameras on any phone, wrapped in a relatively compact frame with top performance, AI features and longevity.Buy if: you want the best camera on a phone that’s not giantDon’t buy if: you want a massive screen or super-long battery lifeRead our full Pixel 9 Pro review: a real contender for the best small phoneScreen: 6.3in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (495ppi)Processor: Google Tensor G4RAM: 16GBStorage: 128, 256 or 512GB Tested battery life (with overnight standby): 50 hoursCamera: 50MP, 48MP ultrawide, 48MP 5x telephoto, 42MP selfieWater resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions: 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mmWeight: 199gFrom £1,099 at SamsungFrom £1,099 at Carphone WarehouseIf money is no object and you want the biggest and best screen on an Android with some of the longest battery life available, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra lives up to its name.The huge 6.9in screen is the brightest and best around, wrapped in a titanium frame with tiny bezels. Four cameras on the back rival the Pixel 9 Pro for the best, including 3x and 5x telephoto cameras. Inside, it has the fastest Android chip available, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, while its two-day-plus battery life helps it go the distance.The S25 Ultra has great software with support until 2032, so you can keep using it for longer with proper care. The phone is packed with loads of the most advanced AI tools, which are still a bit hit and miss, plus a stylus for handwriting and doodling on the screen.Despite being thin and not too heavy, the S25 Ultra is super-sized, which means it requires two hands to use most of the time and might be a struggle to fit in pockets. It also launched at an eye-watering price, which has come down a little but still tops most competitors. Look out on the refurbished market or for deals.Why should you buy it?The S25 Ultra is the reigning superphone champ with the best screen, the fastest chip, very long battery life and more cameras on the back than any other, plus plenty of AI features and even an integrated stylus.Buy if: you want the superphone with the best screen, long battery life and all the extrasDon’t buy if: you don’t want a huge phone at a high costRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: still the superphone to beatScreen: 6.9in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (500ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM: 12GBStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TBTested battery life (with overnight standby): 58 hoursCamera: 200MP, 50MP 0.6x, 10MP 3x, 50MP 5x, 12MP selfieWater resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions: 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mmWeight: 218gFrom £699 at SamsungFrom £759 at ArgosA truly small flagship Android doesn’t exist, but Samsung’s regular Galaxy S25 is the most manageable you can get.It has a great and relatively small 6.2in screen, slim bezels and flat aluminium sides, and it weighs only 162g, making it feel nice and compact. Despite being much cheaper, the regular S25 has the same super-quick chip as its much larger S25 Ultra sibling, plus plenty of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. A decent triple camera, including a 3x telephoto zoom, is on the back.The S25 also runs the same good Android version as the rest of Samsung’s top phones, including loads of AI tools and support until 2032, so you’re not missing out just because it’s smaller.The only downside of the more compact size is a smaller battery. It will still last a solid day, but not much more. You can also find better cameras on slightly larger rivals.Why should you buy it?The S25 is the last great Android flagship at this size, and it doesn’t skimp on features despite its compact and lightweight frame.Buy if: you want a smaller flagship phoneDon’t buy if: you need very long battery life or a big screenRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review: the smallest top-tier Android leftScreen: 6.2in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (416ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyRAM: 12GBStorage: 128, 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby): 37 hoursCamera: 50MP, 12MP 0.6x, 10MP 3x, 12MP selfieWater resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions: 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2mmWeight: 162g£499 at John LewisFrom £499 at AoGoogle’s latest A-series Pixel is the best yet, squeezing almost everything great about the Android-maker’s high-end phones down to a mid-range price.It looks like a clone of the regular Pixel 9 from the front, with a good 6.3in screen and aluminium sides. But the Pixel 9a has a dual-camera system that sits almost flush with the high-quality plastic back. It’s sleek, although it looks a bit generic compared with Google’s previous standout camera designs. It still feels good and has full IP68 water resistance, plus an optical fingerprint scanner and face unlock.The 9a has the same Tensor G4 chip as the regular Pixel 9, keeping it snappy in operation, while the battery lasts a good two days between charges. It only has 8GB of RAM, which isn’t particularly noticeable in day-to-day use but does curb some of Google’s more advanced AI tools. The 9a still has great software, including Gemini, which will be supported for a full seven years from release – almost unheard of at this price.The best part is the camera. While it only has a main camera and an ultrawide one on the back, it shoots better photos than many phones twice the price. In fact, it’s only a smidgen behind the regular Pixel 9 in low light. The 9a even has Google’s popular Best Take and Add Me AI features, plus full access to Magic editor and other tools.A few corners have been cut, including the plastic back rather than glass, an older generation of scratch-resistant glass on the screen, and the lack of support for Android’s built-in spatial audio system for headphones.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 9a offers a top-tier experience but at a much cheaper, mid-range price, making it the best value flagship Android by a mile.Buy if: you want an excellent Android with flagship experience and a great camera for lessDon’t buy if: you want a telephoto cameraRead our full Pixel 9a review: Google’s cut-price Android winnerScreen: 6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Processor: Google Tensor G4RAM: 8GBStorage: 128 or 256GBTested battery life (with overnight standby): 57 hoursCamera: 48MP, 13MP ultrawide, 13MP selfieWater resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions: 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9mmWeight: 186gSign up to The FilterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

They come in various shapes and sizes, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold marries the two forms better than others.When closed, its 6.3in outside screen feels like a normal phone – if slightly heavier – for messaging, calls and anything you might do with the standard Pixel 9. Open it like a book to reveal the high-quality 8in tablet screen ready for big-screen browsing, media consumption and multitasking.The 9 Pro Fold has Google’s top Tensor G4 chip, at least 256GB of storage and up to two days of battery life with light use, or one with heavy use. It has five cameras, including a selfie camera in each screen and a 48MP main, 10.5MP ultrawide and 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera on the back. Those are the best you’ll find on a foldable, even if they’re not quite as good as the regular Pixel 9 Pro. Smart features – such as Made You Look, which attracts kids’ attention to the camera with animated characters on the screen – only add to the experience.The phone has the same software as the regular Pixel 9 Pro, the latest Android version with updates until August 2031 and all of Google’s cutting-edge AI features. You can run only two apps side by side for multitasking, but the software is simpler to navigate than more powerful rivals.The 9 Pro Fold is heavier and more fragile than a regular phone, with a softer internal screen material and a crease down its centre that allows it to fold. It’s water- but not dust-resistant, so keeping it clean will be crucial. And it comes at a high cost, with expensive repairs for any accidents, so insurance may be wise.Why should you buy it?The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a regular phone when closed and a quality small tablet when open, putting two devices in your pocket with fewer compromises than rivals.Buy if: you want the best combination of form and function in a book-style foldableDon’t buy if: you want the most powerful multitasking softwareRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review: the ideal foldable phone designOutside screen: 6.3in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (422ppi)Inside screen: 8in 120Hz OLED (373ppi)Processor: Google Tensor G4RAM: 16GBStorage: 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby): 40 hoursCamera: 48MP, 10.5MP ultrawide, 10.8MP 5x, 2x 10MP selfieWater resistance: IPX8 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions folded: 155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5mmDimensions unfolded: 155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1mmWeight: 257gFrom £1,799 at Samsung£1,329 at AmazonSamsung invented the book-style foldable phone with the original Galaxy Fold in 2019, and it still makes one of the best on the market with the Galaxy Z Fold6. This Android has a narrower closed form than Google’s folder, which makes it more cramped when using it as a phone, particularly when typing. It’s also thicker, though lighter, when folded.The cameras aren’t quite as good as its Google counterparts, but Samsung’s powerful One UI Android software allows it to run up to eight apps on screen at once. It can also be connected to an external monitor, keyboard and mouse to be used as an Android desktop computer.The Fold6 has many AI features, including Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, and will receive updates until at least July 2031.

The cameras aren’t quite as good as those on Samsung’s regular Galaxy S25, though, lacking a telephoto lens. And the outside screen is more limited in capability than some rivals unless you install extra tools. Its cool factor makes it a bit more interesting than a dull slab phone, though.The Flip6 has 2024’s top Android chip and a solid battery life of about two days with light use or at least a full day with heavier use. The phone’s many AI features include Google’s Circle to Search and Gemini assistant, and it will receive software updates until at least July 2031.Like other folding devices, it’s water- but not dust-resistant and more fragile than a regular phone – I’d recommend careful handling and accidental damage insurance.Why should you buy it?The Galaxy Z Flip6 puts a big screen in a cool, compact folding clamshell design that works better than its rivals.Buy if: you want a big screen in something pocketable and interestingDon’t buy if: you’re rough with your phone or want the best cameraRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 review: faster, longer-lasting flip phoneOutside screen: 3.4in 60Hz OLED (306ppi) Inside screen: 6.7in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (425ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3RAM: 12GBStorage: 256 or 512GBTested battery life (with overnight standby): 48 hoursCamera: 50MP, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP selfieWater resistance: IP48 (1.5m for 30 minutes)Dimensions folded: 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mmDimensions unfolded: 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mmWeight: 187gOnePlus 13: great hardware, good camera, a rapid experience and long battery life, but let down by short software support and lack of quality AI tools.OnePlus 13R: a solid handset that feels rapid and well made at a competitive price, but has older chips and short software support.Samsung Galaxy S25+: the middle of Samsung’s flagship pack is good, but it’s bettered at either end by its siblings and costs more than rivals. Look for deals.Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: last year’s best superphone is still worth buying on a deal or refurbished in 2025, thanks to its long software support.Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: a larger version of the excellent Pixel 9 Pro is only bettered by the S25 Ultra for big-screen fans, so it’s worth a look if you’re not tempted by the Samsung.Google Pixel 8 Pro: last year’s top Pixel was great, with updates until at least October 2030, making it worth looking at on a deal or refurbished.Buying refurbished is better for the planet and your wallet than buying new, but Android phones are typically limited in their useful life by a lack of software updates rather than the hardware wearing out. That means the newer the phone from release, the better the buy.Broadly, there are two types of refurbished Android: those that manufacturers, such as Samsung, refurb and sell almost as new and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or conditions (see our guide below).Do not buy:any model older than 24-36 months old because you’ll get only a few years of software support before you’ll have to replace it. Older Android phones get less than five years of support from when they were first released, not when you bought them.any phone without access to the Google Play Store and Google’s services, which are needed for most mainstream apps in the UK.Several third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chains CeX and Game and online stores such as musicMagpie and Envirofone. Marketplaces like Amazon and eBay and refurb specialist Back Market also have a wide range. And some phone operators, including O2, giffgaff, EE and Vodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:Grade A – virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.Grade B – in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.Grade C – in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.Grade D – also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:Battery health – batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?Charging port – check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.Buttons – do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.Fingerprint scanner – is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.Network locks – check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.Unauthorised parts – not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.Check it isn’t stolen – check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against a database of stolen devices through a service such as CheckMEND or similar.Warranty – what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?Flagship phones come at a premium, so you should expect the very best technology and performance throughout years of use. When I selected the phones to test, I considered:Performance – a top-tier chip and snappy performance are essential to keep a phone fast throughout its useful life.Software – should be up to date and come with a minimum of five years of Android updates from release, ideally longer.Great displays – you should expect quality displays with high brightness for outdoor use, high pixel density to keep things crisp and high refresh rates to keep scrolling smooth.Cameras – are the main battleground for the flagship phone manufacturers, so expect the best with multiple lenses and plenty of features.Battery life – should stand up to hard use, at least lasting when used all day.Build quality – top-tier phones are not cheap, so they should be made to last with high quality, ideally recycled materials, scratch-resistant glass and proper water resistance.Sustainability – accidents happen and even the longest-lasting batteries do wear out, so phones should be repairable with real options for replacement batteries, screens and other parts.We combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us  evaluate a phone,  measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.We use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance. The findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.I’ve been reviewing consumer electronics for 17 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.Samuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

            "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves were stewing over their rough start in Game 1 against Golden State, a reaction coach Chris Finch was pleased to see.Julius Randle had 24 points and 11 assists to help the Timberwolves capitalize on Warriors star Stephen Curry’s absence in a 117-93 victory Thursday that tied the second-round series at a game apiece.The foundation was laid in an ornery film session with Finch and his staff the day before.“He was unhappy, and he let us know he was unhappy, and we felt that,” Randle said. “We were pretty motivated as a team.”Anthony Edwards finished with 20 points after an injury scare for the Wolves, who more than tripled their 3-point output (going 16 for 37) from their Game 1 loss when Curry was sidelined by a left hamstring strain that likely will keep him out at least until next week.Nickeil Alexander-Walker added 20 points to spearhead a superb performance by the bench, combining with Donte DiVincenzo and Naz Reid to go 10 for 22 from deep.“We looked a lot more like ourselves,” Finch said.Jonathan Kuminga (18 points) and Trayce Jackson-Davis (15) combined to shoot 14 for 17 from the floor for the Warriors. They took nearly five minutes to score, finally breaking through down 13-0 on Jimmy Butler’s three-pointer.With the NBA’s career leading three-point shooter next to him on the bench, coach Steve Kerr used a kitchen-sink experiment with 14 players getting time.“But I would still like to win,” Butler said. “I think the biggest lesson is don’t start off in a hole like we did tonight, and the game maybe could have ended up a little bit differently.”Kuminga, the seventh overall pick in the 2021 draft who dropped out of the rotation at times during the regular season and missed significant time with a sprained right ankle, was a bright spot off the bench. But this Warriors team was already thin on offense with a healthy Curry.“We have to figure out what we’re going to be able to do in this series without Steph,” Kerr said. “So we gave a lot of people a lot of chances, and some guys really stepped up.”Against the Wolves and their athletic, long and versatile defense, there wasn’t much to lean on. Without Curry to worry about, the Wolves had an easier time keeping shooters Buddy Hield and Brandin Podziemski quiet.The Warriors put up their lowest first-quarter score (15) in the playoffs since Game 6 of the 2016 NBA finals, according to Sportradar, when they had 11 in a loss to Cleveland.Draymond Green picked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, for elbowing Naz Reid after Reid had just fouled him. Afterward, Green expressed frustration over what he called an “agenda” to portray him as an “angry Black man”.“Looked like the angry Black man,” Green said in a brief statement to reporters from the locker room. “I’m not an angry Black man. I am a very successful, educated Black man with a great family, and I am great at basketball and great at what I do.“The agenda to try to keep making me look like an angry Black man is crazy. I’m sick of it. It’s ridiculous.”Adding to Green’s night was a fan who was ejected for directing a racial slur at Green, Golden State team security confirmed. Green was on a stationary bike in the tunnel near the Warriors’ bench in the fourth quarter when he had a back and forth with the fan. Authorities escorted the fan out of the arena.Warriors forward Jimmy Butler said he agrees that Green’s reputation often leads to calls going against him.“No, I think he knows,” Butler said. “We all know. I thought he got fouled and was maybe trying to sell the call. Someone got hit, but it’s crazy. Every time he does something, it’s always a review and always ends up being something of that nature.”Butler added: “He knows how much we need him now more than ever. … so I don’t think he gets to seven [technical fouls].”",

            "content": "On the afternoon of 3 May, arts organizations around the US began receiving cryptic emails from a previously unknown government email account. The missives declared that these organizations’ missions were no longer in line with new governmental arts priorities, which included helping to “foster AI competency”, “empower houses of worship” and “make America healthy again”.Chad Post, a publisher at Open Letter Books, a program of the University of Rochester that specializes in publishing translated literature, got his email just before entering a screening of Thunderbolts*. He put a quick post on Instagram, and when he came out of the movie his phone was full of responses. “I seemed to be the first one to receive this,” he recounted. “But then, all of a sudden, everyone was getting these letters.”Post told me that he had been in touch with 45 publishers who had had their NEA grants terminated, and he suspected that all 51 publishers receiving grants for 2025 supporting the publication of books and magazines had now received the letter. Although Open Letter expects to still receive funding for 2025, Post is convinced that no further money will be forthcoming from the National Endowment for the Arts.“According to rules of the email, we should get the money, although if you come back in two months and they never sent it, I wouldn’t be shocked,” he said. “The chilling part of that email is that they’re eliminating the NEA entirely. It lists all these insane things that are the new priority, and says our venture is not in line with the new priority, so we can’t ever apply again.”The grant termination won’t deal a lethal blow to Open Letter Books, but it will alter the kinds of literature that they are able to publish. Post said that he would have to give preference to books from nations that can offer funding – which tends to favor books from European languages and from wealthier countries.This sentiment was echoed by other arts organizations, who see the loss of NEA money as a significant blow, but not a deadly one. Kristi Maiselman, the executive director and curator of CulturalDC, which platforms artists that often are not programed at larger institutions, shared that NEA grants account for $65,000 of a roughly $1.1m budget. Thanks to proactive work between her team and the NEA, Maiselman received her grant this year, but does not expect any further such money. “It’s a pretty significant chunk of the budget for us,” she told me. “What has been hard for us this year is that we really do provide a platform for artists to respond to what’s going on in the world.” Continuing to promulgate those kinds of artists would be more difficult in future.Allegra Madsen, the executive director of the LGBTQ+-focused Frameline film festival, said that her grant funding had been in limbo ever since the inauguration of Donald Trump, and was ultimately terminated last week. “I think we could all kind of sense that it was going to go away,” she told me. “I think these blows that came this week are going to be felt very intensely by a lot of different organizations.”Frameline is housed in the same building as a number of other arts organizations dedicated to film, including the Jewish Film Institute, the Center for Asian American Media and BAVC Media, and it also sits adjacent to SF Film and the Independent Television Service, all of which Madsen says were affected by the termination of NEA grants. “We’ve all been hit, and we’re all just sort of figuring out what our next steps are.”One fear that Madsen raised was that many private funders take cues from the Federal government, and now with NEA grants terminated – and possibly the NEA itself getting axed – she is unsure if other donors will get cold feet. “This year we have a cohort of sponsors that are very much sticking by us, and I am incredibly thankful for those organizations standing up. But it is a bigger ask now, it’s a bigger risk for them.”Despite the often seemingly indiscriminate cuts made to the federal government by the unofficial “department of government efficiency”, the organizations the Guardian spoke with all believed that they had been targeted in some way because of the programming that they offer. “Just because it’s being done in mass, I don’t think that takes away from the idea that this is pointed and intentional,” Madsen told me. “Governments like this try to attack the populations that seem to have the least power, and right now they are mistakenly thinking that’s going to be our trans and gender-nonconforming siblings.”Taking a similar perspective, Maiselman sees these cuts as perpetuating a broader cultural turn away from arts programs, in particular those that significantly represent people of color and the queer community. “Prior to losing the NEA, we had lost about $100,000 in sponsorships this year,” she said. “We’re hearing from our sponsors that there are a lot of eyes on them. They’re not exactly saying no, but they are saying saying, ‘not right now’.”Post sees private money as a possible way to make up some of the lost NEA funding but fears that there will be a stampede of indie presses all toward the same few donors. “Everyone is feeling a little more broke and a little more strapped right now,” he said. “Arts orgs writ large are going to be competing for funds from the same few individuals and that just scares me.”He also argued that, while a press like Open Letter will be able to continue functioning without NEA money, organizations that only publish literary magazines may fold without significant infusions of private cash. “Those literary magazines don’t have the opportunity to rely on a book breaking out,” he said. “They’re not suddenly going to have an issue of the magazine take off. This might be a massive blow to literary magazines.”Although some arts organizations appear poised to survive the loss of NEA money, they nonetheless feel existentially frightened by the general turn of the political culture away from diversity and toward authoritarianism. “It’s hard right now to see any light at the end of the tunnel,” said Maiselman. “With the rate at which things are changing, it’s going to take years to course correct – that is, if and when the administration changes.”Maiselman further argued that the cultural shift brought in by the aggressive moves of the Trump administration had the potential to profoundly transform the landscape of the arts world. “There’s going to be a reckoning,” she told me. “A lot of organizations won’t survive this.”For her own part, Madsen struck a defiant tone, placing the current repressive political atmosphere in the context of other such threats to the LGBTQ+ community. “We will survive, we have the privilege of being an almost 50-year-old org,” Madsen said. “The LGBTQ+ community has been down this road before. We got through McCarthyism, we got through the Aids crisis, we’ll survive this.”In hopes of surviving, arts organizations are again turning toward one another, finding a community sentiment that many of the people I spoke to called reminiscent of the Covid years. “There are a lot of conversations right now about how we can help one another,” Maiselman told me. Post echoed that, positioning this as a time of collective grieving. “It feels like the end of something,” he said. “It’s sad, it’s all very sad, but we have to keep going somehow. We are damaged but not defeated.”",

            "content": "Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have given Football Daily plenty of ammunition over the years, but with both sealing their place in a European final on Thursday with comfortable victories in their respective semi-finals, this is not meant to be a snide missive about their latest achievements. Sure, Athletic Club can only recruit players from an area the size of Wales, were missing their first-choice centre-back Dani Vivian through suspension, their best three attacking players through injury (Iñaki and Nico Williams, plus Oihan Sancet), were 3-0 down from the first leg and still gave United’s band of global internationals a frightful scare by taking a first-half lead at Old Trafford. But fair play to United, they roared back in the second half, and ended as comfortable winners, 4-1 on the night and 7-1 on aggregate. In reaching the final, Ruben Amorim has a real and tangible reason to be proud of his team, and it’s also nice to see Mason Mount being good at football again.And sure, Bodø/Glimt’s total transfer spend last summer (€7m) was just over 10% of the fee Tottenham paid for Dominic Solanke (Bodø also sold players last summer for a total of €18.6m, a profit of more than €11m), and the Norwegians’ stadium has a capacity that would make them the 16th largest ground in League Two, but genuine credit should be given to Spurs for succeeding in the Arctic Circle where others have failed – this season Porto, Besiktas, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Olympiakos and Lazio have all been beaten by Bodø in Bigger Vase. Tottenham put in a professional display and deserve their place in the final. Chapeau.Ange Postecoglou has a big opportunity now to do one of the least Spursy things of all time by winning this major trophy, a result that would also probably mean the Australian keeps his job and delivers on that much-mocked promise of flamin’ silverware in his second season. “If it’s so easy to get to a final, then why doesn’t everyone who finishes in the top three do it?” barked Postecoglou. “It’s going to upset a lot of people isn’t it? Who cares if we’re struggling in the league? It’s a separate thing. It’s got nothing to do with league form. I couldn’t care less who’s struggling and who’s not. I think both us and Manchester United have earned the right to be there.“I love winning,” continued Postecoglou, ignoring his own comments on Spurs’ league form in the paragraph above. “That’s what I’ve done my whole career. People will dismiss it, that’s fine. We’ve been losing players, key players, and yet they’ve still found a way to stick together. That gives me the belief that the challenge we have of trying to overcome a tough opponent in a massive game.” At least the two finalists will be evenly matched. Despite their much maligned Premier League campaigns, Manchester United (15th) and Tottenham (16th) are just one game away from a European trophy and the riches of Bigger Cup qualification. Just think how many Old Trafford staff lunches that could potentially pay for. Tottenham might even be able to renew Fraser Forster’s £75,000-a-week contract.

            "content": "It is a sunny May afternoon in leafy Surrey, and Richard St Clair is carefully preparing a bomb. It is not real, but it will look like it is when shown on a Netflix TV show. Across the workshop a colleague is cheerfully sandpapering a pile of hip bones for the 28 Years Later zombie film – trailers suggest a lot of skeletons will be involved.They are working at db Props, a small company based at Shepperton Studios that has made everything from Thor’s hammer to Alan Turing’s computer in The Imitation Game.Yet for all its work on huge productions, the workshop has a shadow hanging over it, cast by Donald Trump. The US president this week sent shock waves through the global film industry with a surprise statement that he will bring in a 100% tariff on movies “produced in Foreign Lands”. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” he wrote on his social network Truth Social.“I’m terrified about this new Trump thing – whatever that may be,” says Dean Brooks, the owner of db Props and a 45-year veteran of the props trade after joining at 16. “This has been a proper kick in the teeth.”Britain’s film and video production industry employs about 99,000 people, but it punches well above the UK’s economic weight globally, and has a glamour that other industries cannot match. Hollywood relies heavily on Britain to make its films and big budget TV series such as the recent Star Wars series Andor and Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible franchise. In turn the UK relies on Hollywood for work: inward investment and co-production spend on film and high-end television in the UK reached £4.8bn in 2024, representing 86% of the total, according to the British Film Institute.With a single post, investment into the UK industry has become “impossible” because of “the trauma in the market, the uncertainty in the market”, according to a senior industry executive. “We should be bashing down the door at No 10,” the source says, calling for further UK tax breaks to show support for the industry. “The UK government needs to do something to give the market a lift.”Shepperton is owned by the same company as Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, Britain’s most prominent production hub. There are many more in south-east England alone: big facilities include Shinfield in Berkshire, two units at Hertfordshire’s Elstree, and the former aircraft hangars at Cardington in Bedfordshire. Cardiff, Bristol, Belfast and Scotland all have large spaces. Proposals for new facilities in Marlow in Buckinghamshire and Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, and the revival of Ealing Studios in west London would add even more.“Everybody thinks that the uncertainty alone already has a chilling effect,” says Jon Wardle, the director of the National Film and Television School in Buckinghamshire, whose recent alumni credits include Wicked, Conclave and Gladiator II. The UK has offered tax relief for film production for years, making it a “boringly, Britishly consistent” bet for US producers, he says. Trump has cast doubt over that model.Hollywood studios can claim 25.5% tax relief on UK production expenditure, whereas there are no federal government subsidies in the US. The UK benefits from shared language and culture, up to a point, while costs in Hollywood are much higher in part because of strong unions. US film workers’ unions have responded with delight at the prospect of work being forced back to California, although Wardle says he doubts they would benefit in the end if tariffs are imposed because the overall market could shrink.“The fact that the UK has been eating the US’s lunch when it comes to production for the last decade is no secret,” says one executive. Trump is “absolutely right that the US should be more competitive”, the executive adds, but has got the remedy “horrifically wrong”.There is still a buzz of Netflix productions at Shepperton, but the overall industry has been struggling. The “streaming wars” delivered a huge bounty of work, as Netflix’s rapid ascent and interest rates that were historically low spurred huge spending on film and TV by the US rivals Disney, Amazon and Apple, on top of a host of smaller contenders. However, that boom was ended by a surge in borrowing costs, a Hollywood writers’ strike and an actors’ strike, plus a darkening global economy.“It’s been so bad,” says Brooks. “We can’t handle any more storms.”Brooks’s workshop has areas for woodwork, metalwork and a “sticky room” for forming intricate shapes in silicon moulds – plus shelves of random stuff that might be useful as a bomb fuse or a gothic door handle for the most recent Snow White film. However, he only has three people in his workshop compared with 12 three years ago, and some freelancers have decided to retrain as plumbers or carpenters.“We’re all creative people and we do enjoy it,” he adds. “We’re just not enjoying the environment.”Governments have wanted homegrown film production for almost as long as the industry has existed. In 1927 the UK forced Americans to make a certain number of films in Britain if the country also wanted to distribute Hollywood products there. Companies built studios at Elstree, Teddington and Wembley in response, but it spawned shabby “quota quickies” that were churned out to meet the requirements. Nevertheless, Britain’s industry got past that to become a world leader.Yet the UK faces an accelerating international race between governments keen for the glamour of film and TV jobs. Chunky tax breaks have been on offer for productions in Budapest in Hungary, in the Czech Republic, Australia’s Gold Coast, New Zealand and across Canada. They would also face turmoil from tariffs.The White House has given no clues – if it has any to give – of how such tariffs would work in practice: valuing services as they cross borders is tricky, as is determining when a film counts as American, or who exactly would have to pay higher taxes.“It all looks pretty unworkable given how the international film industry is all bound up together,” says Mike Downey, a veteran producer and chair of the European Film Academy. “It hasn’t been thought through, and it looks to me almost impossible to regulate except with a very blunt instrument.”Yet Downey adds that signs that the US will go ahead will cause “an initial freeze on production, while everyone works out what this means”, and most likely a reversal of so-called runaway productions, when a US-focused show is made abroad.“If they go through, in the worst possible case it will be a total wipeout,” says Downey. “There’s nowhere to turn because no one ever envisaged a world where there would be no US business. The goose that laid the golden egg is ready to take off.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 15:11",
            "content": "Donald Trump said on Thursday he would name Jeanine Pirro, a Fox News host and former local prosecutor, to be the interim US attorney for the District of Columbia after a key Republican senator said he would not support the candidate initially selected for the job.Pirro, who spent more than a decade as district attorney of Westchester county, New York, is a diehard Trump supporter and supporter of his baseless claim that the 2020 election was rigged. Dominion Voting Systems cited false statements she made on air in their lawsuit against the network.The move to select Pirro to lead the office that prosecutes felonies and national security-related cases in the capital pulled Trump out of a fraught situation after he was forced to withdraw the nomination of Ed Martin, who has been serving as the interim US attorney since the start of Trump’s second term in January.Interim US attorneys can serve for 120 days until they need to be confirmed permanently by the Senate. If they do not win confirmation, or if the president has not named a successor, the vacancy is filled by the judges who sit on the bench in federal district court in Washington.The chief US district judge in Washington is James Boasberg, who Trump sees as a judicial adversary, after he blocked the president’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected Venezuelan gang members and then opened a contempt inquiry after his injunction was flouted.Trump had been left in a bind with Martin, who was seen to have hurt his chances for confirmation by being overly aggressive with threats to criminally prosecute Trump’s political adversaries, including the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, people familiar with the matter said.Even if that behavior endeared him to Trump’s wider base, Senate Republicans recoiled at Martin’s threat to prosecute Schumer, the people said, because senators have a history of protecting their own and because they worried about a Democratic appointee acting similarly in the future. This week, the Republican North Carolina senator Thom Tillis said he would not support Martin’s nomination, dooming his chances of approval by a key committee.Martin also lacked allies at the justice department, where senior officials privately grew exasperated at his social media pronouncements that they felt made his US attorney’s office appear dysfunctional, and were not there to advocate on his behalf as his confirmation loomed.For instance, Martin had quickly made clear he intended to use the role to defend Trump, writing on social media that the office would act as “President Trumps’ [sic] lawyers” and saying he would not hire graduates of schools that practiced the diversity policies the president has vilified.NPR also reported on ties between Martin and Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a January 6 rioter whom federal prosecutors called a “Nazi sympathizer”. Martin had told the Senate “I am not close with him”, despite appearing with Hale-Cusanelli at events and praising him.Trump announced Martin’s replacement on his social network Truth Social, praising Pirro as “in a class by herself”. She is the latest in a string of Fox News figures tapped by Trump for government posts, a list that includes the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. The president also said Martin would move to the justice department “as the new director of the weaponization working group, associate deputy attorney general, and pardon attorney”.Pirro agreed on Thursday to take over the position and start unwinding her lucrative Fox News career at short notice, two people familiar with the discussions said, saving Trump from the ignominy of Martin’s nomination sinking in the Senate and then having Boasberg choose a replacement.She has not held a law enforcement job since she stepped down two decades ago as a Republican district attorney in Westchester county, outside New York City, , to pursue failed bids for higher office before becoming a major Fox News host with her own show and co-host duties on The Five.But with Pirro agreeing to take the job, Trump now has a longtime friend and reliable line into one of the most important and powerful federal prosecutors’ offices at the justice department, which itself is being led in large part by his own personal defense lawyers.Pirro has known Trump for decades, and their relationship put her at personal risk by repeating Trump’s false 2020 election fraud. Dominion Voting Systems named her in its defamation suit against Fox, which settled and acknowledged her statements were false.But Trump had also been an ally to Pirro and her family. In the final hours of his first term, Trump pardoned Albert Pirro, Pirro’s former husband and notably his one-time lawyer and lobbyist, who had been convicted on charges of fraud and tax evasion in 2000.Pirro earned her law degree from Albany Law School before becoming a local prosecutor in New York who worked on domestic violence cases. She has been floated for various jobs in the Trump administration, including attorney general. ABC News earlier reported she was under consideration for the role.Robert Mackey contributed reporting This article was amended on 8 May 2025 because an earlier version referred to Ed Martin serving as interim US attorney since February, rather than January of this year.",

            "content": "You wait three years for a trade deal and then two come along at once.As of Monday, the UK had not announced a free trade agreement since 2022, when Boris Johnson’s government signed one with New Zealand, ranked 52nd among global economies.By the end of a week foreshortened by the bank holiday, and which began with Donald Trump dropping a tariff bombshell on the British film industry, the government had unveiled a deal with India, as well as a more nebulous framework deal with the US, the fourth-largest and largest economies, respectively.Sandwiched in between the two announcements was an interest rate cut from the Bank of England, making it cheaper for UK businesses to borrow money to invest in the growth that the Labour government is so desperately chasing.Looking forward, opponents of tariff barriers are now crossing their fingers for a thawing of relations between the US and China, which would avert broader ripple effects depressing UK growth.The US deal also appears to have left the way clear for Starmer to seek stronger economic ties with the EU, another potential lever to boost economic output.Speaking on Thursday, after staging a transatlantic conference call with Trump, the prime minister hailed a “fantastic, historic day”.But have the events of this week really moved the dial for UK plc and the prospects for Britain’s lacklustre economic growth?David Henig, director of UK trade policy at the thinktank European Centre for International Political Economy, was a little more circumspect.“It’s middling,” he said, referring to the combined effect of the week’s trade announcements. “None of this is economically transformational but was anything you could have done ever going to be?”“It’s very Starmerish. It’s 1-0 to the Arsenal.”Henig’s assessment, via a footballing analogy, is typical of the broader reaction from economists and businesses: positive but muted.The impact on growth is “likely to be very small”, said Ben Caswell, senior economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, but should fuel business confidence.The FTSE 100 offers one bellwether of the mood among those with money riding on it. The Trump-Starmer announcement took place on Thursday as trading on the London market was nearing a close, giving investors relatively little time to digest it.There were some obvious winners straight away.Shares in the luxury carmaker Aston Martin soared as Trump confirmed that the tariff on UK vehicles, which was scheduled to rise to 27.5%, would instead be set at 10%.That is also a fillip for the UK’s biggest car exporter, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), whose Solihull plant was apparently chosen as the venue for Starmer’s press conference for that very reason.The UK ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, in an interview with CNN on Thursday, suggested the deal had persuaded JLR to change its mind about planned redundancies. “This deal has saved those jobs,” he said. “That’s a pretty big achievement, in my view, and I’m very pleased that the president has signed it.”The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders hailed the dissipation of a “severe and immediate threat”.However, tariffs on UK cars will still be four times the 2.5% they were before Trump’s “liberation day” tariff frenzy, while the lower rate will only apply to the first 100,000 exports, in effect capping the flow of British marques into the US at just below the 102,000 level achieved last year.Rolls-Royce was another obvious beneficiary after UK negotiators secured an exemption for its engines, used on Boeing 787 passenger jets.The fragile British steel industry also appears likely to benefit from a cooperation agreement, although details are sketchy at present. Trump also indicated preferential treatment for the UK’s pharmaceutical industry, which exports £8.8bn a year to the US.On Friday morning, after investors had slept on it, firms with a US presence continued to make gains.“The FTSE 100 top risers’ list was full of UK-listed stocks that do business in the US, such as retailer JD Sports, rat catcher Rentokil and industrial groups Smiths [Group] and Spirax,” said Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell.However, more than 280 UK-listed companies have so far issued warnings about the impact of tariffs, according to investment firm Bowmore Wealth.Most of those are still facing up to the reality of a 10% tariff on exports to the US that did not exist just six months ago, or the collateral damage from the wider continuing trade war.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionOf the two agreements with India and the US, only the former is a full trade deal at this stage.Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “The potential from India’s growing demand for consumer goods and services is huge.”Henig thinks the agreement with India, which ministers said could add £4.8bn to the UK economy by 2040, offers the more reliable boost, albeit a “slow burn”. “It’s a hope in the future that you can build on what’s there. The US deal is stemming the damage of something that was going to happen.”The stock market also offered insight into potential beneficiaries of improved relations with New Delhi.With tariffs on whisky and gin scheduled to be heavily cut, the spirit-maker Diageo climbed by 1.8% after the India deal was announced, while the Scotch Whisky Association hailed a “transformation” agreement that it said offered the chance to increase whisky exports to India by £1bn over the next five years, creating 1,200 jobs.But the trade body grew a little more sober with every passing minute of the US-UK press conference, as Scotch, which accounts for 2% of UK exports to the US, failed to be mentioned.While the twin trade agreements offered some respite from the turmoil ushered in by Trump’s penchant for tariffs, the pervading atmosphere of uncertainty remains.On Thursday, after a run of disappointing economic data that has only darkened the mood, the Bank of England intervened in an effort to lift the gloom.Its policymakers have cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% to cushion the UK economy against the impact of rising economic uncertainty.Having already cut forecasts, they warned that the UK economy would slow by a further 0.3% over the next three years and stagnate for the rest of 2025.There are reasons to be cheerful.The rate cut heralds cheaper borrowing costs for businesses and homeowners, while falling global oil prices mean lower prices at the pump for motorists.On the unfolding trade picture, Liam Byrne, chair of the business select committee, said the US agreement “does not compromise our ability to pursue a big, bold reset with the EU” before a 19 May summit with the trading bloc, the UK’s biggest trading partner.The US and China are also heading for trade talks this weekend, with any rapprochement that cools their escalating tariff war likely to have positive knock-on effects for all large economies.Henig believes the big win from this week is more in the mood music than the nitty-gritty of announcements on beef, steel or cars.“It’s not in the deals, it’s in attracting inward investment by showing the UK as a good place to do business.“One of the ways you do that is by showing that you have a government able to do deals. All of this is a bit tentative but we were coming from a time of boosterish nonsense saying we’re going to change the world through free trade deals. That was never going to happen.”Leach called on the government to now focus on policy to complement Starmer’s deal-making, highlighting opportunities such as the spending review, industrial strategy and 10-year infrastructure plans.“Removing barriers to growth and investment from excessive regulation – particularly via the planning system – is the big opportunity to get the UK on to a firmer platform for growth and prosperity,” she said.Tina McKenzie, policy chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “Small business confidence may have edged up this quarter, but it’s still stuck in the deep red. The chancellor must use the autumn budget to reform business rates, while the small business strategy must finally fix the pervasive issue of late payments.”",

            "content": "A woman said to be “chief minion” in a ring of Bulgarians convicted of spying for Russia in Britain should not be treated like George Blake, the double agent sentenced to four decades in jail in the 1960s, the Old Bailey has heard.Katrin Ivanova was said by her barrister, Rupert Bowers KC, to have been manipulated by her partner, Biser Dzhambazov, and to then have endured the discovery of his affair with a fellow member of the spy ring while in prison.“She is not the chief minion,” Bowers told the court, in reference to a claim by the prosecution. “There was no initiative on her part, she did as she was directed.”Addressing Mr Justice Hilliard at a sentencing hearing for six Bulgarians found guilty in March of espionage charges, Bowers told the judge his client was involved in something that was “a world away from the classic spy case”.Bowers said the judge should differentiate in his sentencing from “the classic spy cases, the George Blakes” and that of Ivanova, who he claimed had been largely responsible for administrative duties, such as booking hotels and flights.Blake, who died in 2020 at the age of 98, was the most notorious Soviet agent inside Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He was sentenced to serve 42 years in prison in 1961 but in 1966 escaped from Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London.After fleeing to Moscow, Blake was awarded the Order of Lenin. In 2007, on his 85th birthday, he was awarded the Order of Friendship by Vladimir Putin.Ivanova is facing up to 14 years in jail for her role in a spy ring tasked by Moscow with carrying out a series of operations, including stealing identifying details of the phones used by Ukrainian soldiers training on Patriot air defence systems at the Patch barracks in Stuttgart.During the trial of the three members of the ring who did not plead guilty, the prosecution highlighted a message sent by Orlin Roussev, the leader of the spy ring, to Jan Marsalek, a Russian agent believed to be based in Moscow.In the message, Roussev had said he wanted to send to Stuttgart “the minion who will operate the IMSI”, a sophisticated device able to mop up thousands of nearby phone numbers.The prosecutor said Ivanova was the “chief minion” being referred to. She claims to have not been trained to use an IMSI catcher, or even heard of it until after her arrest in February 2023.Her barrister said the judge should look at the outcomes of Ivanova’s work rather than the “fantastical” messages discovered by the police. He claimed that the work carried out by the ring had proven to be “ostensibly useless to the hostile state”.In further mitigation, Bowers said Ivanova had to endure the “lies and the betrayal” of Dzhambazov, her long-term partner.Dzhambazov was in a relationship with both Ivanova and Vanya Gaberova for a year and a half before their arrest.When police raided Gaberova’s flat they found Dzhambazov in bed with her. Ivanova had been unaware of the relationship until after her arrest. He had also told the two women he had brain cancer, which he did not.Dzhambazov, Ivanova and Gaberova will be sentenced with Roussev, Ivan Stoyanov and Tihomir Ivanchev, on Monday.",

            "content": "When Marisa Abela landed the role of Yasmin, Industry’s traumatised heiress, she was still at drama school. Now, she’s a breakout star of the hit BBC/HBO series about the cut-throat world of finance. While the past couple of years have been stratospheric for the 28-year-old – she played Amy Winehouse in Sam Taylor-Johnson’s 2024 biopic Back to Black scoring a Bafta rising star nomination, and was hand-picked by Steven Soderbergh for his recent star-studded thriller Black Bag – she’s excited to be back for the next instalment of the show that made her name. In fact, when we speak she’s sitting in a Pret, all smiles and warmth despite waiting for a severely delayed train from London to Cardiff, where she is filming the fourth series.What was your reaction when you found out you’d been nominated for a TV Bafta?It feels completely surreal. We’re filming Industry at the moment, so I was coming out of my trailer when I saw all of these missed calls from my agent. By the time I arrived on set, the whole crew was there, cheering.What do you think about the scene with Yasmin and her father at the end of season three? It’s not my place to judge her morally. I have to understand why she makes her decisions, and her dad behaves in a way that epitomises the narcissism that she grew up with. Adam Levy did such a great job of making Charles despicable.How do you feel about Harry Lawtey leaving the show?We all started out together, and we’ve had each other’s backs in a big way – we’re such a family. But I respect the fact that when Mickey [Down] and Konrad [Kay, the drama’s creators] make a move in the show, they stick by it. This season does feel different, but in an exciting way. People responded to Industry spreading its wings in season three and having greater ambitions. And I think that’s even more true of season four. It still feels like Industry, but it also feels like the most high-camp, crazy villain origin story of all time.Do you have any similarities with Yasmin as a character?Yasmin’s humour is probably where I’m closest to her. She’s not afraid of taking the piss out of herself or other people around her, and she’s quite dry. Thank God I’m not quite as cold-hearted or complicated as she is! And I think I’m able to be slightly more vulnerable.There’s a lot of nudity in it. Did you use an intimacy coordinator on set?We’ve always had an intimacy coordinator. I see people complaining about them a lot; I just think it’s lazy to be irritated by them. I was 22 when I started filming Industry – when we think about how difficult the acting world has been for so long around issues of consent, the risk/reward is a no-brainer.You played Amy Winehouse in Back to Black. How did you deal with the pressure and expectation that comes with a role like that?As an actor, my job was to quieten all the noise and get as close as possible to the human behind that mythology. At the time, I was off my phone and off social media. But I knew the conversation that was happening, and there were paparazzi; that was difficult. It felt like jumping in at the deep end.What would you say is going right and wrong with the TV industry now?There’s so much being made, which is great because there are so many jobs for actors. But on the flip side, there’s too much and people don’t know what to watch. Sometimes, if a show is on a big streaming platform, they can bury it and no one sees it, and it gets cancelled. If Industry was on a streaming platform, not on a TV network like HBO, it probably would have been cancelled after season one, because it didn’t have the numbers.Do you have any guilty pleasure TV shows?I mean, 90% of the shows I watch are guilty pleasures. I love every franchise of Real Housewives – I’ve just finished Beverly Hills. If you can call that guilty? The Bafta Television Awards with P&O Cruises is on BBC One and BBC iPlayer tomorrow at 7pm.Catch the full lineup of our Bafta TV special launching across the weekend and starring best actor nominees David Tennant, Lennie James, Monica Dolan, Billie Piper, Richard Gadd, Marisa Abela and Sharon D ClarkeRead more in the series",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/09/six-conversations-we-should-be-having-with-partner-friends-kids",
            "content": "In polarising times, when technology has too often made us even more isolated, opportunities for meaningful conversation can go unnoticed. But what are we really missing? What do we forgo when we don’t take the chance to talk? And which conversations matter most? Here, experts highlight six conversations we should be having with one other, but aren’t.“Disagreeing in front of children can feel difficult for parents who fear it will upset them,” says Dr Laura Weingarten, a principal child clinical psychologist in the NHS. “The difficulty with this is that children will often pick up on the dispute anyhow and internalise difficult emotions that they don’t understand.” Instead, says Weingarten, be mindful of your child observing your interactions with your partner or others, and use it as a platform to model the expression of those emotions.While it is unhelpful for a child to witness disregulated “arguing” between caregivers (ie, screaming rows), a difference of opinion is healthy and normal. Explaining and modelling that disagreements are OK, giving those “difficult” emotions labels, and letting them understand that we can reach a positive resolution will stand them in good stead for life.”A good opportunity to start a conversation is when the child themselves has had difficulty managing a disagreement, for example with a sibling over a toy. “Find the words they can’t necessarily find themselves,” says Weingarten. “You could start by saying, ‘I can see you are feeling upset and that must be very difficult for you.’ Tell them, ‘I’m here for you and I understand.’ This shows them that disagreement is manageable and isn’t something to be afraid of. In those moments, you can also revisit a time when they witnessed disagreement, and make sure they noticed the resolution afterwards by saying, ‘Do you remember that time Mummy was upset with Grandpa, then they made up? See, it’s OK when we disagree and talk to each other about it.”“It is difficult for people of all ages, but especially teenagers, to ask for what they want in an effective way,” says Weingarten. “But once they have mastered the balanced art of expressing their needs and wants without being combative or blowing things out of proportion, all conversations become easier.”Wanting to feel socially accepted can make this a particularly hard task in the teenage years. “This makes it a good time to have the conversation,” says Weingarten. “They may find it hard to ask for a teacher’s support without feeling frustrated, or to speak to a friend who didn’t invite them to a party without being angry. Explaining how to communicate effectively will allow them to achieve what they want and need without jeopardising relationships.”Weingarten suggests talking to your teenager about the need to do this fairly, explaining that they never need to over- or under-apologise, exaggerate or act helpless when expressing their wants. In practice, this means helping your teen to feel confident describing the difficulty they have with a situation and then expressing how they feel to you and others: “Tell them they don’t need to say sorry for what they want, but neither do they need to shout it. For example, they could tell a friend planning a night out, ‘I’m OK with you wanting to do something different, but I know that I won’t feel good there. Please can we choose somewhere else or do our own thing this time?’ They should be able to communicate in this clear, honest way, safe in the knowledge that it is fair to everyone involved,” says Weingarten.Family therapist and associate professor at the University of Exeter Prof Hannah Sherbersky explains that relatives can sometimes get stuck “in role” with one other: “It’s exciting to remember that the people we love who are older have lived out completely different roles that bear no resemblance to the one they now inhabit in relation to us,” she says.She suggests asking them about what they were doing when they were your age to spark a new type of conversation: “They might tell you about a relationship, a job, where they were living, a move.” The conversation provides an opportunity that might otherwise be missed to learn from and know a different version of an ageing relative; it can also inform our own decision-making and place in the world.Sherbersky says: “We get very caught up in what’s different between us and other generations rather than what is the same. With this conversation, the elderly relative is invited to step back into another aspect of themselves that perhaps they’ve lost touch with: a time they may have felt stronger or had more sense of agency in the world, or perhaps life was more complicated and they can reflect on how they feel more content now.”There are benefits for the younger relative too: “It can give us perspective on where we are in our lives and help us think about our own future,” says Sherbersky. “What qualities, transgenerational values, skills, stories and memories will be passed down?” This provides an opportunity to consider whether they are good things or whether they are influences we’d like to end.Sherbersky adds: “Often we learn things about someone after they have died; what a shame not to have known it when they were alive.”By asking how they felt when they were reprimanded as a child, what you’re essentially saying is, “How did you respond to feedback?” says therapist and bestselling author Nedra Glover Tawwab. “Knowing if they continued to repeat the issue, it they were a good listener, did they yell and fight with their parent, or did they think, ‘This is something I can work on,’ tells you what works and what does not.”She adds: “You’re saying, ‘What is the thing that sets you off? Let me understand what’s happening here, so I’m not pushing those buttons.’ If you know they came from an overbearing parent, you don’t want to mimic that behaviour; if they had an indecisive parent and you’re indecisive, you can understand why they’re short on patience – because they feel like they’ve been dealing with this forever.”Sign up to Inside SaturdayThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

They don’t feel personally attacked even though their feelings are hurt. They’re upset because there’s a disruption, but they know ‘you love me’.”“Our attitude to wealth is tied to our values, making it among the most important topics if you’re looking for a long-term partner,” says matchmaker Paul C Brunson, host of the podcast We Need to Talkand author of Keep Love.“I tell people to ask: ‘Would you rather a) be paid £50,000 while others make £25,000 in the same job, or b) receive £100,000 while others get £250,000?’ This question unpacks empathy – one of the most important character traits that you see in high satisfaction relationships – and provokes considered thinking. It’s not necessarily about the answer, it’s about the thought process. If someone gives up or completely turns off to it, they’re not ready to be a partner and put in the kind of consistent effort relationships require of us.”If there is disagreement, he says, it serves another purpose: “You immediately have an opportunity to see if you can begin to resolve conflict with the person in front of you, which is the number one behavioural set you need in a relationship.”“Each relationship meets a need and, in doing so, serves a function,” explains family and systemic psychotherapist Mark Stroud. “In friendships, the need may be a sense of competition through playing sport, excitement from going clubbing, relaxing by drinking together. Often friendships meet more than one need but, almost universally, their function is an unspoken negotiation that is rarely, or never, talked about. When someone can no longer meet a need, maybe because their work or caring demands have changed, we can feel hurt.” Stroud says that by coming together and figuring out what the function of the friendship is, you can determine whether it remains the same for both people or if you want to renegotiate and agree to meet each other’s needs in a different way now that circumstances have changed: “It allows you to deepen and evolve your friendship. For example, clubbing might no longer be on the cards, but trips away could provide the excitement.”Stroud says this type of conversation can be hard. “You should choose a setting and a way of talking that is familiar and comfortable to you both – on a bike ride, over a meal or going for a walk, depending if you’re used to catching up with each other against some background activity or in a quiet spot.“It can be helpful to start by raising the changes you have noticed, such as, ‘We don’t go out as much as we used to,’ or, ‘I’ve noticed our plans keep getting cancelled at the last moment.’ Own how that makes you feel – for example by saying, ‘It makes me sad because … ’”But he adds: “Make sure you don’t locate the problem in them: apportioning blame will get in the way of thinking about how you ‘do’ being friends differently. Invite their experiences of the change too, and be open to their perspective – they may experience it as coming from your life. Remember to be curious about the other person’s experiences and to be kind to each other; it takes two to make the friendship work.”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/voting-florida-elections-california",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 15:00",
            "content": "Clint Curtis is a familiar face among election skeptics in the United States. The Florida-based lawyer and former computer programmer has said he once developed a software that could change votes. He opposes the use of voting machines and highlights his connection to proponents of election conspiracy theories, including Mike Lindell and Steve Bannon.Soon he is slated to start overseeing elections in Shasta county, California, a conservative region of 180,000 people in the state’s far north where Republicans vastly outnumber Democrats.After holding public interviews, the governing body in Shasta voted late last month to appoint the out-of-state candidate – who has never before overseen an elections office – to serve as the county clerk and registrar of voters.“I think now is the time to do things differently and lead in a different way,” said Kevin Crye, the chair of Shasta’s board of supervisors, and one of three supervisors who supported Curtis for the role. He said that Curtis could “right” what he believes is wrong with elections.The move was not unexpected in a county that has emerged as a center of the US election denialism movement, which maintains that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election. But the decision to appoint Curtis over more experienced candidates, such as Joanna Francescut, the assistant elections clerk and registrar of voters who has worked in the office for more than 16 years, shows the deep foothold election fears and conspiracy theories have in the county.Shasta county has faced years of political turmoil with the rise of a far-right faction in county government, and decisions around elections and voting have been particularly contentious.The region’s elections office reported increased harassment and aggressive behavior toward workers in past years. Cathy Darling Allen, the longtime elections clerk who retired last year, reported being frequently maligned by ultra-conservative elected officials and residents convinced of widespread voter fraud.In 2023, the county’s board of supervisors cut ties with Dominion Voting Systems, the voting machine company at the center of baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud, and ordered the creation of a system using a hand-count in an effort to “restore trust”.Patrick Jones, a far-right supervisor who promoted the plan, argued that year that “Elections have been manipulated at the county level for decades” and that Shasta’s efforts could put a stop to the supposed interference. Amid national outcry, state lawmakers intervened, passing a bill preventing counties from using costly and error-prone manual tallies in most elections.But the residents who believe conspiracy theories about voter fraud and stolen elections and the supervisors who have expressed skepticism in the process, have not given up on their efforts to transform voting in the region. While Shasta is a small county with political aims at odds with those of the Democratic state, what happens here has provided a framework for election deniers on how to advance their agenda across the US and reverberated nationally.When the county was considering ousting Crye, one of its most conservative officials, national figures including Rand Paul and Trump ally Kari Lake urged residents to vote no on the recall.Last year when Allen announced her retirement after 20 years due to medical issues, the Shasta county board of supervisors held public interviews to replace her. Curtis and Francescut both applied then. Francescut, who oversaw the office of the county clerk and registrar of voters for months after Allen went on leave, had the endorsement of elections officials and prominent area Republicans.The board opted then to appoint Tom Toller, a former prosecutor who had never worked in elections. He vowed to change the office culture, improve public confidence, and suggested he would be willing to push back against the California secretary of state’s office. In the end Toller was a vocal supporter of the office, and said he never saw evidence of fraud. He rejected suggestions from a local voting commission to take action that he said wouldn’t comply with state law.Toller announced plans to resign in March due to medical reasons and endorsed Francescut for the job.When the board of supervisors again held public interviews in April, both Francescut and Curtis applied for the job. Residents who have frequently spoken publicly about their concerns about vote tampering and stolen elections, expressed support for Curtis. But others urged the board to hire Francescut.“Appointing her would not only be the logical choice but also a step toward ending the chaos and division that has plagued our elections for the past three years,” one speaker said.“Without a doubt appointing a self-proclaimed election expert with no ties to our community, no elections experience and a history of promoting unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud would be a grave disservice to the voters of our county.”Francescut highlighted her 16 years of experience in elections and history of working with the board of supervisors.“I have a great technical knowledge,” she told the board. “The work of election administration requires a diverse skill set, including the ability to tabulate ballots as well as marketing and educating voters.”Curtis has been known in election integrity circles since claiming that he developed a software to hack voting machines in 2000 at the request of the Florida state lawmaker Tom Feeney. He was reportedly interviewed by the FBI and spoke to Congress about his claims. Feeney, who Curtis ran against for a congressional seat, as well as his employer, denied those allegations.Curtis, who previously ran for Congress as a Democrat, told the board of supervisors he felt compelled to “fix” elections because of the software he claimed to develop. “I broke it so I better fix it,” he said.He said had a plan to secure elections in Shasta county by installing cameras and filming every step of the process so its integrity can be verified.He also mentioned his appearances on the shows of Steve Bannon, Michael Flynn and Mike Lindell and said he had worked in elections law for years, citing consulting work with governments in Germany and the Netherlands about hand-counting (although he declined to provide contact information for people who could verify such work or other clients to the local outlet A News Cafe.) That same outlet reported that he appeared to have lied on his application for the role. Curtis also said he had worked on the Kamala Harris ballot audit when she ran for attorney general in California.Curtis told the board he preferred hand-counting but would follow state law, and that running elections was a “pretty straightforward process”.“We can secure our elections without having to have that hand count so everyone can still see everything,” he said.Supervisor Matt Plummer opposed Curtis’s appointment, arguing his ideas had a “track record” of failure and pointing to widespread community support for Francescut. “The voters of Shasta county want Joanna in this role,” he said.Supervisor Chris Kelstrom, however, said his appointment could “change voting not only in Shasta county but possibly the whole state and possibly the whole nation”.The board voted 3-2 in favor of hiring Curtis to serve out the remainder of the term. The appointment will be finalized after the completion of a background check.In response to a query from the Guardian, Curtis emphasized that he had worked with people of different political beliefs.“I do not judge people by their political beliefs and feel that we must be willing to treat everyone with respect. Failing to do so just keeps us at each other throats and we accomplish nothing,” he said in an email.The news of his appointment was met with dismay by Francescut’s supporters, including Morgan Akin, who has volunteered as a poll worker in the county alongside his wife for several years. He said he wasn’t sure if he would continue to volunteer. “She has 16 years of service there and they hired a guy who has no experience in elections.”Soon after the decision, Francescut announced her intention to run for the office in 2026.",

            "content": "Rarely has a Bafta TV awards ceremony taken place against such a background of industry anxiety: plummeting terrestrial ratings, aggressive streamer competition, a precipitous drop in UK production. Even sponsors P&O Cruises will rarely have seen such troublesome seas.Bafta voters (I am one, but don’t know any final results) will also have brought other external concerns. Jurors may worry that Mr Bates vs the Post Office (premiered January 2024) now feels too old, which could count against Monica Dolan and Toby Jones in the acting categories. (Because of calendar year qualification, Adolescence may have the same problem in 2026.) Also, older voters can be reluctant to see pushy rich streamers thriving: they’ve just about come to terms with Netflix but Disney+ and Apple TV+, who have a strong shortlist presence, may, for some, be the future too far. Here are my preferences and predictions.Anna Maxwell Martin won in 2006 and 09 (Bleak House/Poppy Shakespeare) and would merit a triple crown for her visceral performance as a survivor of terrible domestic violence in Until I Kill You. Billie Piper has four previous nominations without an award but risks Scoop, in which she played Newsnight producer Sam McAlister, being seen by message-sensitive voters as a “Prince Andrew show”. But surprisingly receiving her first nod, Sharon D Clarke has long been one of the most electrifying screen and stage performers and deserves to win for the culture-clash drama Mr Loverman.Clarke’s co-star, Lennie James, is a strong contender in the male category. But, despite exceptional talent and CV, David Tennant scandalously had to wait until last year for a first Bafta chance (in the comedy performance section with Good Omens). He’s still waiting for a statuette and I’d like him to get it for Rivals, in which he brought the depth of a Shakespearean baddie to a TV mogul. But US resident Gary Oldman happens to be in the UK (for his superb Krapp’s Last Tape at the York Theatre Royal) and so would be in easy reach of the stage to add a TV Bafta to his movie one (Churchill in Darkest Hour) for his meticulously dishevelled disgraced spymaster in Slow Horses.A guarantee of class in any cast for 50 years, Jonathan Pryce has somehow escaped Bafta nomination and should dust off that space on his shelf for his showing as David Cartwright, an elderly spy who can’t remember what he’s meant to forget, in Slow Horses. Pryce would also, unusually, have been worth a slot for his cameo flashbacks as the dead Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light but that show is represented by Damian Lewis, another strong contender for his portrayal of King Henry VIII: physically widening, mentally declining but still politically and maritally terrifying.Baby Reindeer – after largely overcoming early legal and ethical concerns – was a stand-out show and has two nominees here: Jessica Gunning and Nava Mau. Unless they split the stalking drama’s vote, Gunning feels the category favourite. Although there will have been love in the room for Katherine Parkinson, in Rivals’ most empathetic role, and Monica Dolan’s gangster was the best thing in Sherwood. (Plus, this panel won’t know if the best actress jury honoured her for Mr Bates. She may lose both.)At Sunday’s ceremony, much discussion will reflect a sense of the BBC struggling against the streamers’ quantity of top-end fiction. More optimistically, the UK’s oldest broadcaster has 75% of this year’s candidates for best drama series. Sherwood’s second series showed a decline so it feels to be between Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light, or, if the panel is feeling more radical, Blue Lights, the break-out Northern Irish police hit. If Supacell nicks it for Netflix, the BBC table will be funereal.Baby Reindeer already won the best writer prize for Richard Gadd in the drama category of the Bafta Craft awards and, if Mr Bates vs the Post Office is penalised for distant transmission, it should win again. If the jurors needed their hearts warming, One Day or Lost Boys & Fairies might come through. The latter – a fresh and inventive adoption drama – would be a surprising but justified winner.The rise of overseas streamer drama makes Bafta’s single international category look ridiculously cramped. Even more confusingly, two of this year’s six – After the Party and Colin from Accounts – ran on heritage British networks: Channel 4 and BBC Two. That New Zealand/Australia pair are strong runners, with After the Party having found new space in the urgent but crowded territory of abuse accusation. However, as a remake of a 1980 mini-series made with very different cultural and casting assumptions, Disney+’s Japanese epic Shōgun would be the deserving choice for panellists keen to celebrate the New Television.Though a hit, the David Mitchell doppelganger detective show Ludwig may feel more of a drama. ITV2’s G’Wed has already done well to be fighting at this weight and so Alma’s Not Normal, for its last full series, feels the natural winner after a year in which the welfare system and austerity have been central political debates.Channel 4’s specialism of edgy humour pays off with three impressive runners: Anjana Vasan (We Are Lady Parts), Kate O’Flynn (Everyone Else Burns) and Nicola Coughlan (Big Mood). Lolly Adefope may suffer for being in a show, The Franchise, that has already been cancelled. Sophie Willan has won before for Alma’s Not Normal and a double would be justified, but this is the last chance to honour Ruth Jones for Gavin & Stacey. This will have been one of the toughest to judge.Closed rooms may have an effect here if judges concluded that Danny Dyer (Mr Bigstuff) was more deserving in Rivals, not knowing that he missed a shortlisting there. Young talent dominates with twentysomethings Dylan Thomas-Smith (G’wed), Nabhaan Rizwan (Kaos) and Bilal Hasna (Extraordinary). As a Northampton Town season ticket holder, though, I’m cheering on teenager Oliver Savell for his brilliant mimicry of Alan Carr, son of club legend Graham Carr, in Changing Ends.Budget cuts have left many shows from the industry’s fun factories looking cheap and not particularly cheerful. So, for its sheer consistency of creativity and attention to detail, Michael McIntyre’s Big Show deserves a second Bafta.In the TV world, there’s much affection and guilt over Andrew Flintoff, who, it becomes increasingly clear, was lucky to survive an accident while filming Top Gear. Disney+ got the documentary on that (a likely contender next year) but his remaining BBC franchise – in which he coaches young cricketers from disadvantaged backgrounds – is charming, informative and socially important, showing the talent that English systems (and not just cricket) miss: a series one discovery just made a county Second XI debut. The second innings – Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams on Tour – was even higher-scoring.The least tense category in Bafta history, as the annual shortlist now involves choosing three from five and then rotating the winners around that trio. EastEnders has already had a special award in the Craft section so, in one way, it would be odd if the BBC long-runner didn’t also win this. Then again, that might expose the category’s limitations. It feels like a birthday battle between EastEnders, reaching 40, and Coronation Street, now 65, ahead of Casualty being honoured next year for four decades.With soap advertising the weary longevity of some series, new breakout successes (increasingly rare) are at a premium in all sections. In a culture of reboots and remakes, The Traitors, though adapted from a Dutch template, is a genuine sensation and deserves recognition, having been overlooked for its first series. Claudia Winkleman did win entertainment performance last year and seems the biggest challenger again to Ant & Dec (three previous wins, six nominations) and Graham Norton (six wins, five nominations). Regardless of what happens here, Winkleman’s three hit shows – Strictly Come Dancing and The Piano as well as The Traitors – surely mark her as a special award or Bafta fellowship waiting to happen.I was on the nominating panel for this but the final vote is public. Mr Bates, Bridgerton, Gavin & Stacey, Rivals, Strictly and The Traitors will all have support. The naked tennis scene in the Jilly Cooper adaptation really made a social media racket but more viewers will have seen Smithy’s wedding so it feels like a golden goodbye to Gavin & Stacey. The 2025 Bafta Television Awards are on BBC One at 7pm on Sunday.",

            "content": "We have already tumbled past the first 100 days of the second Trump presidency, careening down the hill with reckless abandon. One hundred days is, of course, a totally arbitrary milestone – a nice, round number that looks monumental because of the number of zeros attached.With inflation and looming tariffs continuing to hobble commerce, shouldn’t we extend this marker in kind? If you go by the rate of inflation since the final year before Donald Trump’s ascension to power, we should be looking at the first 133.25 days. Time itself is arbitrary, speeding up or slowing down based on context and personal perception. A minute can feel like an eternity if you’re stuck in traffic on Sunset Boulevard.And there’s no pastime more connected to the elasticity of time than golf – a pastoral game where there’s no clock regulating speed, just a common sense of politeness for your fellow golfers and the slowly setting sun. It’s a game American presidents have loved for decades, but one that especially tickles the current occupant of the office. Of Trump’s first 100 days in office this go ’round, he’s spent parts of 40 of them (and 12 of 14 weekends) on one of his personal properties, offering the president a chance to indulge in his favorite sport. After his tariff announcement on 2 April, Trump was spotted hitting balls at Mar-a-Lago.“The president won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, FL, and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow,” declared a White House statement. I wonder if they’d have issued the remarks if he had lost. Maybe they would have revised their words to soften the blow. “The President competed rigorously, showed grace and honor, and at one point miraculously revived a man who fainted in the blistering heat with a mere touch to his forehead.” Or maybe they would have disputed the results of the match entirely.Just last weekend, Trump golfed with the Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, ahead of the Eagles’ visit to the White House to commemorate their victory in last year’s Super Bowl. Barkley took heat for whacking balls with Trump, but he doubled down on his incredulous enthusiasm at his good fortune on X. “lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed [sic] and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT. Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago … and look forward to finishing my round with Trump! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing [sic] day.”The implication Barkley is making is that golf is inherently apolitical, that as soon as you step on the course, nothing matters but the fun of the afternoon. Maybe there’s an element of truth to that notion that golf is a great equalizer – a sport where power dynamics are flattened and participants give themselves up to the whims of the natural world.Or not.I don’t understand golf. I don’t love it. But I don’t hate it, either. I have played golf multiple times. I was even gifted a set of clubs by my golf-loving father when I turned 13. I have no true antipathy toward the game. I’m simply mystified by its appeal to the rich and connected and the average citizen alike. Golf can be played at a tony country club or a ratty nine-hole near the freeway with a six-pack of Bud Light always at the ready. OK, maybe I understand that last bit, but I just don’t get why Trump is so enamored with this game that he’ll carve out significant chunks of time in the twilight of his life to pursue it.Granted, golf requires patience, years of practice, and mental acuity. So does knitting. Why doesn’t Trump sit at home making a lovely blanket for his wife to curl up with on the couch during The White Lotus? He could perfect the art of making gluten-free zucchini bread, then hand it out to White House staffers and ask them how much they love the carob chips he sprinkled throughout the loaf? Imagine Volodymyr Zelenskyy biting into the sweet and savory goodness of a nice slice of zucchini bread while Trump pontificates about the ceding of territory to Russia. At least Zelenskyy would have something to take home in a Tupperware container after getting shafted.Golf is a game where futility is expected, where failure is right around the corner, and frustration is always simmering. The most exciting part of golf is hitting the ball, but the rules encourage you to hit the damn thing less, not more. Instead, most of the time during a golf game, you’re pondering, or worse yet, idly chit-chatting. The old saying goes: “golf is a good walk spoiled.” But is the walk even that good? A good walk is one where you see something unexpected, you bump into an old friend, or you have a chance to truly ruminate on the state of your life. A good walk is restorative and life-affirming. A golf course is not a pedestrian haven. It’s a zoo for people in polo shirts. You basically wander around in a circle for four hours, just to end up back where you started – a clubhouse with overpriced food and gaudy furniture.In that sense, it might actually be the perfect game for Trump. His tenure in the White House has felt like a particularly rough round of 18 holes. Decisions, like a tiny golf ball, blown haphazardly around by the wind. Traps laid out with the explicit purpose of screwing things up for you. A journey to nowhere that ends with disappointment. And like golf, despite all the evidence to the contrary, people line up to do it all over again anyway.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humorist",

            "content": "Appearing in public without your trousers? For most of us, it’s the stuff of nightmares. But for a handful of people who scaled the Met Gala steps on Monday night, it was simply fashion.The singer Sabrina Carpenter and the pop star and actor Lisa were among celebrities who attended wearing Louis Vuitton tuxedo jackets, stockings and little else. Naturally, Carpenter wore an espresso-coloured bodysuit with coat tails, while Lisa’s sparkly knickers were embroidered with replicated portraits by the US artist Henry Taylor.Wicked’s Cynthia Erivo joined them with her hot pants exposed under a black tulle Givenchy gown of some size. The Colour Purple actor Taraji P Henson arrived in a tuxedo micro-dress by Monse that barely covered her crotch, and the model Hailey Bieber finished her thigh-skimming Saint Laurent blazer with a pair of black stockings and little else.For Valerie Steele, the storied fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the look “didn’t seem that shocking”. Rather, it was a straightforward way to straddle the gala’s “superfine tailoring” theme and the wearer’s desire to dress up. “You could either wear a suit, or just go for the tailored jacket. As some people are more conditioned to wearing a dress, or heels, it was really the easiest way to fulfil the brief.”These trouser-free outfits consolidated a trend that has been growing legs in the last few years: the “day knicker”. Kendall Jenner was among the first to go out in her undies, buying flowers in a Bottega Veneta crew neck and knickers in 2022. Her look was trumped only by a pair of £600 low-rise Miu Miu briefs in shades of canary yellow and tomato red, which became the most in-demand high-fashion item, as worn by Emma Corrin and Alexa Chung out and about. As the designer Miuccia Prada said after the show: “The point is, you can choose what you wear.”Underwear-as-outerwear tends to rear its head most decades. In the 1960s, “once women were able to show their legs and wear miniskirts, to go in a tailored top was not that big a step”, said Steele. Indeed, Edie Sedgwick’s jumper, mesh stockings and black-knicker outfit became something of a countercultural inspiration for years to come. Steele also recalled when the socialite Nan Kempner was refused entry to a restaurant for wearing a trouser suit in the late 60s. Her reaction? “She went to the bathroom and took off her [trousers].”Since then, knickers-not-trousers have popped up at Vivienne Westwood and Louis Vuitton, where Kate Moss accessorised a sturdy pair with a lit cigarette. In the 2000s, it was au courant for young women to flash their thongs. Indeed, Lil Nas X flashed his at 2023’s Met Gala. This season, Mother Denim has a knicker-showing “fold over” pair of jeans with a button permanently undone.Steele thinks the trend says more about legs as status symbols. The 1930s fashion historian James Laver often talked about the ever-shifting erogenous zone: cleavage, back and legs.The personal trainer for the Bridgerton cast, Aimee Victoria Long, said showing off toned legs was about celebrating female strength. “The idea that ‘leg day’ is a male-only concept is outdated. We are moving away from the outdated ‘skinny at all costs’ to a look that’s strong, capable, and sculpted.”The critical reaction has been mixed. Steele thinks these accusations of sartorial transgression are linked to politics. “Things have turned so far to the right, we have gone back 50-60 years … it’s like slut-shaming,” she said. “The tailored suit seems so masculine and formal, it’s just the contrast that triggers the shock.“It’s about context. It’s all performative. Lisa [from White Lotus] is in a girl group, and God knows the Met Gala is known for outre clothes,” said Steele. “But if you put it that way – they forgot to wear their [trousers]! – then sure, it might seem shocking.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 15:00",
            "content": "Billed as a prequel to id Software’s 2016 revival of Doom, The Dark Ages is about as different as it could be from its predecessors while remaining recognisably part of the series. Where 2020’s Doom Eternal was about speed and evasion, The Dark Ages emphasises standing your ground. Where Eternal involved picking off enemies one by one, The Dark Ages empowers you to obliterate dozens of demons simultaneously. Where Eternal saw you juggling rapid-fire weapons in a finger-cramping frenzy, The Dark Ages lets you solve most problems by hitting things ferociously hard. Ripping and tearing are out. Blunt force trauma is in.The kernel of The Dark Ages’ combat stretches back to the 1993 original, inspired by the slow-moving projectiles fired by enemies such as imps, cacodemons, and hell knights. The Dark Ages empowers most of its enemies to shoot such projectiles, making its interdimensional battlefields glow with drifting fireballs, scudding orbs and floating energy barriers.You must navigate these obstacles as a slower, heavier Doom Slayer, one so physically dense he triggers a thunderclap when landing from a height. Indeed, it feels like he shouldn’t need the shield which forms your primary defence against these projectiles. It can be used simply to block oncoming missiles, but certain attacks can also be deflected, returning them to sender. Successfully countering a projectile can stun its shooter, opening them up for a finishing “glory kill”. While still bone-crunchingly vicious, these executions are generally less elaborate than in previous games, often (but not always) reduced to a straightforward punch or kick.Many demons attack hand-to-hand in patterns it’s beneficial to memorise, while the largest and toughest foes are nearly all close-range duellists. These face-offs tend to take place within much larger battlefields, where smaller enemies prowl in their dozens and rows of undead shield-bearers guard their larger leaders. Id Software has devised several new weapons to deal with these infernal legions, such as a demon-impaling rail-spike launcher, or a gun that shreds enemies with the shrapnel of crushed skulls.It’s a fascinating reformulation of the core ideas of Doom, and learning the rhythm of its shooting is as fun as witnessing its devastating effect. It is an easier riff to master than Eternal, however, while the slower pace and less stringent toolset mean that, at its highest level, it doesn’t produce the same adrenaline rush.It doesn’t help that the system is stretched over the flabbiest game id Software has made. The Dark Ages’ 22 levels are all vast in scope, and many are open-ended, letting you pick your battles and unpick their secrets in whatever order you choose. Yet although the scale is impressive, the levels can be wearying to traverse, and it doesn’t always feel as if the game makes the most of this real estate from a combat perspective.Id Software tries to counterbalance the slower pacing by mixing up how you explore. Some maps see you piloting an enormous mech called an Atlan, punching mountain-sized demons in slow-motion combat. Others involve flying around on the back of a dragon. There’s novelty value here, but the game doesn’t really know how to make either a meaningful experience. These parts are reminiscent of the obligatory vehicle sections that plagued shooters in the noughties, and the best I can say for them is they don’t crop up too often.That said, I admire how much more experimental Doom: The Dark Ages is than it needed to be. Far from resting on its laurels, id Software seems possessed by a Nintendo-like urge to innovate. It wants Doom to be the shooter that rewires how you think about the genre with each new entry. The Dark Ages isn’t as successful at doing so as id Software’s earlier fare, but it is nonetheless a highly accomplished, smartly designed shooter that, at its best, hits like a truck. Doom: The Dark Ages is released on 15 May, £70",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 14:58",
            "content": "The US supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor has said that lawyers should stand up and fight in battles faced by the nation’s legal system, amid attacks on federal judges and Donald Trump’s targeting of elite law firms in executive orders.“Our job is to stand up for people who can’t do it themselves. And our job is to be the champion of lost causes,” she said on Thursday. “But right now, we can’t lose the battles we are facing. And we need trained and passionate and committed lawyers to fight this fight.”Sotomayor did not mention the president as she spoke at an event in Washington DC hosted by a section of the American Bar Association (ABA), which has also been targeted by Trump.The liberal justice’s remarks come a day after the conservative-leaning chief justice, John Roberts, defended judicial independence as necessary to “check the excesses of the Congress or the executive” at an appearance in Buffalo, New York.Last week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson forcefully condemned attacks on judges in her own speech. She did not mention Trump by name, but called the threats and harassment “an attack on democracy”.The nation’s highest court is weighing a growing number of emergency appeals from the Trump administration as his sweeping conservative agenda faces pushback in lower courts.The president and his allies have railed at judges who have blocked parts of Trump’s agenda, sometimes with highly personal attacks. Trump has also targeted elite law firms over work he disagrees with, leading some to fight back in court and others to strike deals with him.The ABA has sued Trump over federal grant terminations and Trump has threatened the organization’s role in accrediting law schools over its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.And on Friday it was announced that former supreme court justice David Souter, who joined the court as a supposed conservative “stealth nominee” under President George HW Bush but instead emerged as a liberal justice, died on Thursday at age 85.He was known to be bookish and reclusive but while on the bench backed abortion rights and dissented in the 2000 ruling that gave the presidency to the Republican George W Bush, son of George HW Bush, over Democrat Al Gore.Souter, who served 19 years on the court before retiring in 2009, died peacefully at his home in New Hampshire, the court said in a statement on Friday.“Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,” Roberts said in the statement. “He will be greatly missed.”",

            "content": "She is a pillar of industrial music who was called a “wrecker of civilisation” in the UK parliament because of her subversive and boundary-pushing art, and who wrote one of the best music memoirs of recent years. Now, with a new album due for release, Cosey Fanni Tutti will be answering your questions.Born Christine Carol Newby in 1951, she was a founding member of the music and performance art collective Coum Transmissions. Their 1976 exhibition Prostitution prompted the aforementioned parliamentary commentary, plus plenty more controversy besides: it featured explicit photography of Tutti – who also worked as a stripper and in the adult film industry – alongside rusty knives, syringes, bloodied hair and used sanitary towels.Then in 1975, with her Coum collaborators Genesis P-Orridge and Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson, Tutti formed the band Throbbing Gristle, along with Chris Carter. Built from samples, effects and noise, their work continued the frankness of Coum Transmissions: Zyklon B Zombie was a reference to the lethal gas used in the Nazi death camps and Hamburger Lady was inspired by the story of a burns victim. Throbbing Gristle became icons of underground music.After the group disbanded in 1981, Tutti and Carter formed the synthpop duo Chris & Cosey (latterly Carter Tutti) and put out 17 studio albums over the years. Tutti reflected on her transgressive – and at times traumatic – life’s work in her memoir Art Sex Music, published in 2017, and later wrote another book, Re-Sisters, telling the stories of two other radical women: the 20th-century electronic composer Delia Derbyshire and 15th-century mystic Margery Kempe.Tutti is now getting ready to release her new album, 2t2, in June, and will answer your questions. Would you like to know more about where her provocative art comes from? Her appearance in the video to Sylvester’s disco classic You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), or her time in an art commune in Hull? Post your questions in the comments before 10am BST on Tuesday 13 May. Her answers will be published in Film & Music on 30 May.",

            "content": "Ten UK energy suppliers including EDF, E.ON and Octopus are to pay £7m in compensation and refunds after overcharging customers, after a review by the energy regulator for Great Britain.Ofgem said the suppliers had agreed to pay more than 34,000 customers compensation and refunds because of erroneously billing them more for standing charges than is allowed under the regulator’s price cap. Standing charges are daily fees added regardless of how much energy is used.The affected customers all had restricted meter infrastructure, meaning more than one electricity meter point recording usage at their property, and were erroneously overcharged between January 2019 and September 2024.While energy suppliers are allowed to apply multiple standing charges for homes with multiple electricity meters, companies are not allowed to break Ofgem’s price cap, which limits the maximum amount that can be charged in each unit of electricity or gas used.Charlotte Friel, the director of retail and pricing systems at Ofgem, said: “Our duty is to protect energy consumers, and we set the price cap for that very reason so customers don’t pay a higher amount for their energy than they should.“We expect all suppliers to have robust processes in place so they can bill their customers accurately. While it’s clear that on this occasion errors were made, thankfully, the issues were promptly resolved, and customers are being refunded.”The 10 suppliers have agreed to pay out £5.6m in refunds and almost £1.4m in goodwill payments.Ofgem found that Octopus had the most customers affected by the error in overcharging, at 20,862 of the 34,048. The other suppliers to give refunds were E.ON Next, Ecotricity, EDF, Outfox the Market, Ovo Energy, Rebel Energy, So Energy, TruEnergy and Utility Warehouse.A spokesperson for Octopus apologised but added that it occurred on a “particularly rare” type of meter, affecting only 0.3% of its customer base.“Mistakes happen, and we’re sorry when they do,” a spokesperson said. “We were following one piece of Ofgem regulation but in doing so accidentally infringed another. We are glad to have now made it right for them.”Friel said the ruling served as a reminder to all energy suppliers that they must implement the price cap properly and “do their due diligence”. She added: “It also shows that, where appropriate, Ofgem is prepared to work with suppliers that fail to comply with our rules.”Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionMiatta Fahnbulleh, the minister for energy consumers, said: “No family should suffer the experience of being overcharged on their energy bills, and companies have an obligation to be accurate in their billing. This government is fighting for working people by driving up protections for consumers in the energy system. It is very important that Ofgem has today taken swift action to fine companies that overcharge consumers.”On Wednesday, Ofgem ordered Good Energy to pay £150,000 in total to former prepayment-meter customers because of a failure to issue final bills.Since 2014, Good Energy failed to send final bills to customers within six weeks of customers leaving the company, as is required under energy supplier licences.Ofgem found that 2,284 customers were affected and the average sum paid per customer was £66.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 14:46",
            "content": "Aid groups have voiced alarm at US moves to pressure them into accepting an Israeli proposal to resume limited humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory under strictly controlled conditions.The Trump administration has attempted to strong-arm international agencies – including the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP) – into accepting Israel’s stringent rules for resuming deliveries, according to sources familiar with the discussions and news reports.A two-month blockade has left the coastal enclave’s 2.3 million inhabitants facing the prospect of starvation. The blockade was imposed by the Israel Defense Forces in March after the collapse of a ceasefire to the conflict that broke out after Hamas’s October 2023 attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel. So far, more than 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel’s military response.Under the auspices of a newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is based in Geneva, aid would be delivered to four “hubs”, where recipients would have to go to collect it under the watchful gaze of private US security contractors, who would use facial recognition technology to vet who receives it.Israel insists the stringent measures are necessary to prevent aid being stolen or diverted to Hamas, although some assistance organizations have said they have seen no evidence of such practices.Aid groups have so far refused to participate in the scheme, fearing it violates “fundamental humanitarian principles” and breaches international law.Some have privately voiced concerns about potential “complicity in war crimes because of how the aid will be distributed”, according to one person in close contact with assistance organizations, who spoke on condition of anonymity.“There is a concern that this aid plan risks enabling war crimes related to forced displacement, starvation and internment,” the person said. “This is a scheme to make it seem like this is about aid, but what it’s really about is entrenching military occupation of Gaza.”Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said this week that the Gaza population would be moved “for its own protection” under an intensive new Israeli military offensive. Israeli officials have indicated a plan to concentrate the entire population in the south of the strip.Opposition has been firm even as some organizations, including World Central Kitchen and the WFP, have admitted that an inability to replenish supplies has left them unable to continue feeding the population.Even if aid is resumed, some groups say, the conditions Israel is stipulating will prevent it reaching many of those in need.“If you centralize, privatize and militarize aid delivery through this proposed hub model, it means that people will be excluded from getting humanitarian assistance,” said Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, which has been providing medical assistance – including to severely malnourished children – at 16 sites in Gaza.“People simply won’t be able to come to these distribution sites, either because of fear, logistical constraints, or distance. Even more importantly, many will be reluctant to come to centralized sites that are overseen by armed personnel, and given the way that that Israel has fought this war with incredible numbers of civilian casualties.“The best thing that the US and Israeli authorities can do is to lift the restrictions and allow us to … work safely [and] protect medical sites [and] humanitarian workers.”Sign up to This Week in TrumplandA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationafter newsletter promotionBut with living conditions growing increasingly dire, the Trump administration is pressing humanitarian outfits to accept Israel’s terms. US officials have reportedly met the UN and aid groups this week, even threatening to slash the WFP’s budget – which Washington partly funds – if it refuses to accept, according to the Times of Israel.Donald Trump told reporters in the White House on Monday that “the people of Gaza are starving and we’re going to help them get some food”. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met members of the UN security council on Wednesday to discuss the Israeli plan, according to the Washington Post.Trump has previously proposed having US taking ownership of Gaza and converting it into a “Riviera”, a scheme which would involve relocating its population to other countries.A state department spokesperson said Trump was seeking “creative solutions” that would “protect Israel, leave Hamas empty-handed, and help Gazans”.“We welcome moves to quickly get urgent food aid into Gaza in a way that prevents it from falling into the hands of terrorists, such as Hamas,” the spokesperson said. “We support a plan to get in aid now and urge others to do so as well.“Endless press releases and Hamas appeasement haven’t delivered food, medicine, or shelter to those who need it. This is a new approach with one focus: get help to people NOW.”",

            "content": "Newcastle have risked upsetting some supporters by announcing plans to redesign the club’s badge for the 2026-27 season.With St James’ Park executives deciding the crest, that dates back to 1988, is overly elaborate and unsuited to global digital branding requirements, Newcastle are working with designers and consulting fans as they begin rebranding a symbol they believe has become outdated.The new image will be the fourth crest Newcastle have worn since the 1950s. The current badge features the city’s original coat of arms.Its disappearance will sadden supporters. The two seahorses on a coat of arms also containing a lion sitting atop a castle turret and bearing the flag of St George are redolent of the city’s seafaring and defensive traditions.“As our club grows on the global stage, the symbol that represents us needs to be able to keep pace,” the club said in an email to supporters on Friday, when Newcastle officials emphasised that a week-long consultation process would involve fans submitting their preferences regarding the new badge before being allowed to vote for one of a number of options. “It needs to show up clearly and confidently across everything from kits to screens to merchandise.“It’s time to update our crest. This isn’t a decision we take lightly. We love our crest. It’s iconic and has stood us through unforgettable triumphs and testing times. But it was created in a different era. It’s intricate design doesn’t always translate well in today’s digital world. And it’s difficult to reproduce it clearly and consistently.

It’s full of ripely gothic religious imagery, including the little angels with their stiff angular wings holding an ostentatiously bejewelled crown over Mary’s head. Yet look at her face. Her features are depicted with stunning precision as she looks down with gentle affection and modest reverence at her holy child. No one could portray a face this accurately before the 15th century, and the skill and technique were first perfected in Flanders by Jan van Eyck.Yet this may not be a northern work at all. It’s tentatively attributed by the National Gallery to Antonello da Messina, one of the first Italian artists to assimilate Van Eyck’s discoveries. It was even said he journeyed from Naples to Bruges, befriended Van Eyck and stole his secrets. That is just a legend.

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/08/storms-mississippi-valley-climate-change-study",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 14:33",
            "content": "The four-day historic storm that caused death and destruction across the central Mississippi valley in early April was made significantly more likely and more severe by burning fossil fuels, rapid analysis by a coalition of leading climate scientists has found.Record quantities of rain were dumped across eight southern and midwestern states between 3 and 6 April, causing widespread catastrophic flooding that killed at least 15 people, inundated crops, wrecked homes, swept away vehicles and caused power outages for hundreds of thousands of households.The floods were caused by rainfall made about 9% more intense and 40% more likely by human-caused climate change, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) study found. Uncertainty in models means the role of the climate crisis was probably even higher.Another nine people died as a result of tornadoes and strong winds, and the economic damages have been estimated to be between $80bn and $90bn.The record rainfall was driven in large part by warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico that fed the storm moisture that it dropped across Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. Overall, the human-caused climate crisis made surface sea temperatures 2.2F (1.2C) hotter, and such ocean conditions are now 14 times more likely compared with in a cooler, pre-industrial world, the study found.The region has been pummeled by multiple deadly storms over recent years including Hurricane Helene in September that killed more than 230 people mostly from heavy rainfall and flooding.But last month’s death toll could have been much worse – if it had not been for the around-the-clock forecasting and early warnings by the National Weather Service (NWS), which is facing major cuts and staff layoffs thanks to Donald Trump and his billionaire donor Elon Musk, according to the study authors.Overall, the NWS issued 728 different severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings – the third-highest number on record – that helped local authorities issue timely evacuations orders and position emergency resources that saved lives.“These floods didn’t make front pages, but they should have. At least 15 people died, homes were ruined and farmland turned into swamps,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. “In an increasingly dangerous world of extreme weather, a well-resourced forecasting workforce is essential. The recent layoffs at the National Weather Service workers will put lives at risk.”A combination of weather patterns, including the collision of two air masses, created a storm that lingered and subjected the region to days of apocalyptic weather including hundreds of tornadoes, hailstorms, landslides and wind events. Based on historical data, similar downpours are expected to occur on average about once a century in today’s climate with 2.3F of heating above pre-industrial levels.Yet things are on track to get much worse. If the transition from oil, gas and coal to renewable energy sources continues at today’s snail pace, four-day spells of rainfall will be twice as likely and 7% more intense by 2100, the study found.Sign up to Down to EarthThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essentialafter newsletter promotionThe NWS is among key federal agencies under assault by the Trump administration that research, prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, which were already overwhelmed due to the climate crisis.Nearly half of NWS offices have 20% vacancy rates – double the level of short-staffing compared with 10 years ago. Amid mass layoffs and buyouts, there is no chief meteorologist at 30 of the 122 NWS local offices including several in Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee where the storm struck, according to CNN.Trump’s climate-related cuts come on top of policies to boost fossil fuels and block renewables, as the US braces itself for another year of destructive wildfires, extreme temperatures and Atlantic storms.“We’re dealing with floods, droughts, wildfires and heatwaves – many times all at once – and science keeps confirming they’re getting more dangerous as the planet heats up,” said Shel Winkley, weather and climate engagement specialist at Climate Central. “Understanding precisely where and when these unnatural extreme events will strike is vital for protecting public safety.”This is the 101st WWA study, a decade-old initiative that provides rapid scientific analysis on whether and to what extent human-induced global heating driven by burning fossil fuels and deforestation has altered the likelihood and intensity of a local extreme weather event. The latest study was conducted by 15 researchers as part of the World Weather Attribution group, including scientists from universities and meteorological agencies in the US, UK, France and Netherlands.",

            "title": "Director Ava DuVernay calls on artists and historians to resist ‘criminal’ Trump",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/09/ava-duvernay-trump-comments",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 14:28",
            "content": "Ava DuVernay, an Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning director, has urged artists and historians to hold the line against a “criminal” US president at a time when “truth itself is under revision”.DuVernay, whose films include Selma, which chronicles Martin Luther King’s campaign for voting rights, issued the rallying cry while receiving an award at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington.The ceremony came against the backdrop of Donald Trump signing an executive order that seeks to purge “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution. The president has also seized control of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and fired the librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden.Asked if she is alarmed by Trump’s assault on arts and culture, DuVernay told the Guardian: “Certainly. But not surprised. When you elect a criminal you should expect crimes.”Trump is the first convicted felon to serve as president, having been found guilty last year on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels. Yet his election did not surprise DuVernay. “It feels right in line,” the 52-year-old mused. “I study history. So.”Selma was the first film directed by an African American woman to be nominated for a best picture Oscar. DuVernay’s other works include 13th, a documentary about racial injustice and mass incarceration, and Origin, an adaptation of the historian Isabel Wilkerson’s book Caste.On Thursday she became the first director, writer and producer to receive the Smithsonian’s Great Americans Medal, which recognises lifetime contributions that embody American ideals and ideas. Previous honourees include the secretary of state Madeleine Albright, general Colin Powell, musician Paul Simon, doctor Anthony Fauci and supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (posthumously).In an acceptance speech that drew a standing ovation at the National Museum of American History, DuVernay did not mention Trump by name but offered a stirring defence of the Smithsonian, which she described as “an institution that understands the weight of history and the wonder of telling it well.“That understanding feels especially urgent now at a time when truth itself is under revision and fear feels like an animating force. Fear of mirrors, fear of memory, fear of the full American story told in its dazzling complexity and devastating contradictions.”The film-maker, who grew up in Compton, California, continued: “History is not a weapon to be sheathed when inconvenient. It’s not a bedtime story meant to lull us to sleep. It is a river flowing deep and often turbulent and the Smithsonian has long been the bridge that lets us cross with care. We know that what is sometimes labelled improper ideology is in fact connective. That what some call distorted is simply a new perspective, long buried, now revealed.\n “Let me tell you about a child who walks into the Smithsonian museums and sees a photograph of a woman who looks like her mother or grandmother, standing tall in protest or in prayer or in pride. Let me tell you about a teacher who brings students here because their textbooks do not speak of redlining or Tulsa or internment camps or Stonewall.“Let me tell you about families – Black, white, Native, immigrant – who walk through the doors of Smithsonian museums and feel that this country might just make room for them after all. That is not indoctrination. That is belonging. That is education. That is democracy.”DuVernay paid tribute to the Smithsonian secretary, Lonnie Bunch, for confronting the contradictions in America’s founding and illuminating the fault lines in its systems. “Because the truth is there is no honour in history that flatters itself,” she said. “There is no integrity in memory that only remembers some and there’s no future in forgetting.“To those who would close their eyes to injustice, who would silence the voices of our elders, our ancestors, our scholars, our artists, I offer this. We will not comply with forgetting. We will not make myths in place of memory. We will not trade the truth for contortions in comfort.“Instead we will gather, we will remember, we will teach, we will share, we will tell it all. Let us hold that line and let us remind those who try to restore a narrow divisive view of the past that the future belongs to the whole of us. And even when the current swell is upon us, the bridge will hold because truth deserves passage. And with the Smithsonian and this museum we do not cross alone.”Founded in 1846, the Smithsonian is the world’s biggest museum, education and research complex. But Trump’s executive order, issued in March, argues that the institution has recently “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and calls on Vice-President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s board of regents, to lead a counteroffensive.In an interview Anthea Hartig, the director of the National Museum of American History, said her institution had not felt political pressure yet. “We put ourselves through our own paces and we need to be able to defend our scholarship, our choice of interpretation and our framing and then engage in honest discourse. So far it’s been a very honest and forthright exchange.”She added: “We appreciate everyone’s concern deeply and we truly ask them to continue to support us and to visit and to engage in the big questions of history that we present.”",

Can these bear fruit and turn the tide?With a bleak fiscal inheritance, and further economic turbulence since, can Labour truly deliver on the changes they promised to revolutionise the nation’s health service, get a grip on immigration, improve schools and boost living standards? And are they able to fight off the rising tide of the populist right?On the international stage, Keir Starmer has played a crucial role in trying to secure peace in Ukraine, and has handled the unpredictable relationship with Donald Trump with skill. Yet how will he deal with the accumulating consequences of the US president’s trade wars and foreign policy betrayals, including in the Middle East, and the UK’s reset in relations with the European Union?On Wednesday 9 July, the Guardian’s political editor Pippa Crerar will chair a panel of experts, including the Guardian columnist Rafael Behr, Salma Shah, the former Conservative special adviser to Sajid Javid and Frances O’Grady, Labour peer and former TUC general secretary. Join them, live in London and online, as they discuss the first year of the Labour government and its next three years in power.This is also your chance to ask them your own questions and to fully understand Labour’s decisions and achievements: from its early moves to its long-term plans for the country.You can join this event in-person at Conway Hall, 25 Red Lion Square, London, WC1R 4RL or via the livestream.

            "content": "The US has granted refugee status to 54 white Afrikaner South Africans, who could arrive as soon as Monday in Washington DC, where they will be welcomed by government officials, according to media reports.Donald Trump suspended the US refugee settlement programme in January on his first day in office, leaving more than 100,000 people approved for resettlement stranded, having fled war and persecution in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Afghanistan.In February, Trump signed an executive order directing his government to grant refugee status to Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and French colonisers who he claimed were discriminated against.On Thursday, US officials were trying to arrange a charter flight to land at Dulles international airport, with commercial flights being assessed as an alternative, NPR reported, citing unnamed sources.The 54 Afrikaners would be met at the airport by “high level officials from the Departments of State and Homeland Security”, with a press conference being planned, NPR said, citing a source who said such a welcome was unusual.Some officials told the New York Times that the arrival date was not yet confirmed, with plans in flux.A US state department spokesperson did not confirm the flight plans, saying: “The US embassy in Pretoria has been conducting interviews and processing … While we are unable to comment on individual cases, the Department of State is prioritising consideration for US refugee resettlement of Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination.”South Africa’s foreign ministry said in a statement: “It is most regrettable that it appears that the resettlement of South Africans to the United States under the guise of being ‘refugees’ is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa’s constitutional democracy; a country which has in fact suffered true persecution under apartheid rule and has worked tirelessly to prevent such levels of discrimination from ever occurring again.”The speed at which the new refugee programme was set up and refugee status granted was faster than normal, a source told NPR. Before the first Trump administration, it took an average of 18 to 24 months for a refugee to be resettled in the US, according to the American Immigration Council, an NGO supporting immigrants.NPR listed 12 states that had agreed to take in the Afrikaners, some of whom have family in the US, including California, West Virginia and New York, NPR said.The Department of Health and Human Services will help the South Africans with “housing … basic home furnishings, essential household items … groceries, weather-appropriate clothing, diapers, formula, hygiene products and prepaid phones,” according to a memo seen by the New York Times.South Africa was ruled by white Afrikaner leaders during apartheid, which violently repressed the country’s black majority.More than three decades after white minority rule ended, South Africa remains hugely unequal. White people typically have 20 times the wealth of black people, according to an article in the Review of Political Economy. The black South African unemployment rate is 46.1%, compared with 9.2% for white people.According to the 2022 census, white people made up 7% of the 63 million population, about half of them Afrikaners, while black South Africans accounted for 81%.Affirmative action policies since apartheid’s end have helped to create a black elite and middle class. However, most black South Africans remain poor.The policies, along with high crime rates that affect all South Africans, have also nurtured a feeling among some white South Africans that they are now the victims of targeted racism.More than half of white South Africans think “black economic empowerment” policies should end, compared with a third of black South Africans, according to a survey by Ipsos and the local news outlet News24.Trump, along with his South Africa-born billionaire adviser Elon Musk and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, have repeated the allegations that white South Africans are being discriminated against.Trump’s February executive order referred to “hateful rhetoric and government actions fuelling disproportionate violence against racially disfavoured landowners”.In 2018, during his first presidency, Trump also magnified the unsupported claim, popular globally with the far right, that white farmers in South Africa are being murdered at disproportionately high rates.US refugee officials were directed to focus on screening white Afrikaner farmers from among the more than 8,000 asylum claims, the New York Times reported.",

            "content": "A huge day in import-export yesterday, as even Rome’s billion-per-cent tariff on American popes was lifted. The much bigger news, though, concerned the partial easing of recently imposed import taxes on British goods in the form of a starter UK-US trade deal, leaving the biggest little country in the world basking in the glow of an achievement our own prime minister seemed to hint had something of VE Day to it. In Britain, we have an old saying about dejection – “you look like you’ve lost a pound and found a sixpence” – but this was an entirely new spin on that scenario, given we were mostly celebrating being back to paying 10% more tariffs than we were subject to a few weeks ago. Yessss! A sixpence! Good times.Before we get to the specifics of the deal, the theatre. I do find myself increasingly mesmerised by Trump’s Oval Office tableaux, which typically feature him surrounded by a cluster of sniggering mooks (eg the vice-president). Trump is like the boss in a cartoon about a crew of gangster dogs. Like Fat Sam from Bugsy Malone – but a bloodhound-chinese crested cross. Call him The Dogfather. So yes: the big dog was seated at his desk, while the henchdogs stood awkwardly round ready to laugh obsequiously on cue. And, bless them, they hit every single one. On this occasion, the boss dog was basking in their oleaginously indulgent chuckles, but you get the feeling that on a bad day it could go quite the opposite way. “Shaddup, Vance, you idiot. Did I say you could snigger?” “No, boss. Sorry, boss.”Anyway, to each mook his day. Surgically removing his own dignity live on TV with no anaesthetic was Howard Lutnick, the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO turned commerce secretary, who at one point burbled: “I want to make this clear. This was the president’s deal. People think, ‘Oh, that’s not the way it works.’ If you got to sit next to him – I have the BEST dealmaker to my left. And if you don’t think that we take advantage of him calling the prime minister and getting that deal done, you don’t understand who’s the president. He’s the closer. He gets deals done that we could never get done, because he understands business, he understands deals. And that’s why we’re here today.”Watching this speech, I was seized by the powerful apprehension that this was the buildup to a musical number. It had all the hallmarks – Lutnick becoming suddenly more animated and mannered, his delivery even slowing slightly, until the only thing missing was the striking up of the band for the debut of your new ear-worm song, He’s the Closer!Lutnick: Well, here’s a poser …Vance: Just who’s the closer?Lutnik: Could it be …?Vance: Yes, it could!Lutnick: He’s our orange bulldozer!(Keir Starmer joining in over speakerphone for the second chorus.)Anyway: the deal, which was either “maxed out” or “the end of the beginning”, depending on whether you were listening to the boss dog or the British ambassador, Peter Mandelson. It was understandably received very well in the car factories of the West Midlands, but less so in the outrage-manufacturing plant presided over by the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. “Keir Starmer called this ‘historic’,” she posted. “It’s not historic, we’ve just been shafted!” Ooooooh! I think it’s better when party leaders don’t talk like this – it’s certainly less of an excruciating cringe for everyone else. But my working theory is that Kemi Badenoch has decided to spend her tenure as Tory leader either calling for things she could have done but didn’t when her party was in power, or explaining why you’d never catch her doing anything anyone might regard as an achievement by her rivals. I’d give her six months, tops – potentially in dog years.“The US and UK have been working for years to try and make a deal and it never quite got there,” declared Trump as Starmer joined the announcement remotely. “It did with this prime minister, so I want to just congratulate you.” Most compliments from Trump have the potential to be a stab in the back, and this one may yet turn out to be a lesson in being careful what you wish for. The UK-US trade deal has been an El Dorado-just-around-the-next-corner for so long that notions of its capabilities and value have grown outsized in the public imagination. To have heard all the prime ministers who couldn’t close it talk, it could save us from decline, it could sweep away all the losses incurred by severing ties with all our nearest geographical neighbours, it could make us the rich global buccaneers we once were. Time after time over the past few years, politicians keen to get us to live on the never-never have suggested that just as soon as they landed it, it might be the answer to everything.As the prime minister who did land it, Keir Starmer now has to return the public imagination to the realms of reality by November, when the budget will surely bring both tax rises and spending cuts, which have somehow not been headed off by ensuring the price of a Range Rover Evoque is only quite a bit higher instead of quite a lot higher. It’s probably best he starts managing expectations on that front sooner rather than later. To the victor go the spoilers.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 14:15",
            "content": "Chemicals in everyday plastics may disrupt the body’s natural 24-hour sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythm in a way similar to coffee, which increases the risk of sleep disorders, diabetes, immune problems and cancer, new in vitro research shows.The study looked at chemicals extracted from a PVC medical feeding tube and a polyurethane hydration pouch, like those used by long-distance runners. PVC and polyurethanes are also used in everything from kids toys to food packaging to furniture.The findings showed for the first time how plastic chemicals probably wreak havoc on cell signals that regulate the body’s internal clock, throwing it off by up to 17 minutes.The internal clock is “incredibly important for physiology and overall health”, though more research is needed to know the precise consequences of exposure, said Martin Wagner, a study co-author and plastic chemical researcher with the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology.“This study adds to the increasing body of evidence that plastics contain compounds that cause a wide range of toxic effects,” the authors wrote in the peer-reviewed study published in Environmental International. “A fundamental shift in the design and production of plastics is essential to ensure their safety.”The circadian rhythm is the molecular clock that regulates alertness and tiredness in relation to daylight and the dark. Shifting rhythms are linked to increases in the risk of obesity, dementia and cardiovascular disease, among other issues.Research into plastic chemicals’ toxicity most often focuses on how chemicals like phthalates and bisphenol impact the endocrine system and hormone-related effects, which can take years to manifest. The new paper looked for an impact through a different biological pathway: cells. It checked for adverse effects on the adenosine receptor, which is a key component in cellular control of the internal clock that takes part in relaying signals that regulate circadian rhythm.The biological process of how the plastic chemicals affect the body is similar to caffeine in its effects on the circadian rhythm and adenosine receptor. Caffeine deactivates the adenosine receptor, thus increasing the circadian rhythm and keeping us awake. The plastic chemicals activate the adenosine receptor, but also have a similar effect in keeping us awake.The receptor is in the brain and “sends signals to the body that say ‘the sun is coming up – let’s start the day’,” Wagner said. But when the adenosine receptor is activated by the chemicals, it may not relay the message, delaying the body’s natural physiological processes.While the chemicals are not as potent as caffeine, their impact on the cellular processes happens much more quickly than plastics’ impacts on hormones, Wagner said.What this means for the body is unclear, but it is probably not good, Wagner said.“We don’t know the significance of it and you could say, ‘Oh it’s just 15 minutes so it’s not a big deal’, but it’s such a tightly controlled clock that it’s a significant shift,” he added.The study was done in vitro, meaning on human cells in a lab, and Wagner said the next step was to look at how the chemicals affect zebrafish, which have some similar physiological processes in their brains to humans.Future research will also look into which chemicals in plastic and PVC are affecting the sleep-wake cycle. PVC can contain any of 8,000 chemicals, some of which are not intentionally added but are byproducts of the production process, so the material is incredibly complex and difficult to manage.The findings of each new study will be used to pressure lawmakers to enact regulations, and to try to convince industry to remove the chemicals from the plastic, Wagner said.",

            "content": "The UK’s limited trade deal with the US has immediately prevented job losses at Jaguar Land Rover’s plant in the West Midlands, Britain’s ambassador to the US has said.“This deal has saved those jobs,” Peter Mandelson said in an interview on CNN. “That’s a pretty big achievement, in my view, and I’m very pleased that the president has signed it.”Government sources said JLR had plans for imminent cuts among its 30,000 staff in the UK but had not informed unions in the hope that a deal with the US could be struck to eliminate the 25% tariffs on exports of cars to the US.Donald Trump’s import taxes had threatened to cripple British high-end carmakers before they were reduced from 27.5% to 10% in a deal announced on Thursday by Trump and Keir Starmer, with JLR only last week resuming exports to the US after a 30-day pause following the US president’s announcement of tariffs last month.Government insiders confirmed the decision to go for a quick deal while they could, announcing what they said was a breakthrough agreement to eliminate tariffs on car and steel exports.“It was important to us to be able to bank the progress that we had made at this stage,” said an insider.The UK business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told the BBC’s Newsnight programme on Thursday that the UK was at risk of thousands of people losing their jobs in the automotive sector within days, with one senior government insider indicating the job losses would have been at JLR.Reynolds said: “This was very, very serious. It means people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough, and it would have been a real economic hit to the UK. We got to a position where we’re able to make announcements … that have averted some very difficult things happening in the UK.”Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, suggested the real life impact of the loss of thousands of jobs in the car sector would have been far deeper and could have affected more than 100,000 families employed directly and indirectly in the sector.Adrian Mardell, the JLR chief executive, hailed the agreement, saying it would help to sustain 250,000 jobs. “We warmly welcome this deal which secures greater certainty for our sector and the communities it supports,” he said.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionUK car exports to the US attracted a 2.5% tariff before Trump decided to slap a further 25% import tax on foreign cars.The 25% tariff meant that, if passed on to the consumer, the price of the lowest-cost Range Rover Evoque could have risen by nearly $12,500 (£9,400) and added $27,000 to an entry-level Range Rover that typically sells for more than $100,000.Tariffs apply on delivery date rather than order date, which means vehicles shipped last week will no longer be subjected to the 25% tariff.",

            "content": "The power outage that closed Heathrow airport for a day in March cost British Airways £40m, the national carrier has revealed.The airline said it was “assessing options” but said it had no recourse to compensation from Heathrow.Airlines were infuriated by the response and recovery time from the power outage, which came about after a substation caught fire overnight. A report from the National Energy System Operator  on Thursday confirmed that Heathrow took seven hours to reopen after its power was restored, allowing only a handful of flights to operate.The BA chief executive, Sean Doyle, said there was no automatic form of recovery for the airline, either from insurers or in compensation from Heathrow, for the lost revenue, refunds and costs of looking after delayed passengers.Doyle said: “We’re obviously assessing options, but under regulation at the minute, we’ve no immediate recourse.”A Heathrow-commissioned review into the incident conducted by the non-executive director Ruth Kelly is expected later this month.Despite the costs of the power outage, BA’s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG) said first-quarter revenue rose by 9.6% to €7bn (£5.9bn), while operating profit increased by €130m to €198m.IAG also announced it had struck a $13bn (£9.8bn) deal to buy 32 new planes for BA from the US aircraft maker Boeing, a day after a trade agreement with the US cut tariffs on the industry.The group – which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling – also announced an $8bn deal for 21 Airbus aircraft, to be deployed across IAG.The announcement came a day after the US agreed to scrap tariffs on Rolls-Royce jet engines, used on the Boeing and Airbus aircraft, which led to the company’s share price soaring by almost 4% in trading on Thursday.Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, welcomed the tariff exemption but said the aircraft deal and the broader trade announcement were coincidental – despite the order being cited by the Trump administration before it was revealed.Gallego said: “The UK government and Boeing were aware we were in this tender process. Tariffs in general we believe are not good... no tariffs will help us to develop the business, and I assume they took that into negotiations.”The IAG chief financial officer, Nicholas Cadbury, added: “It’s helpful for us, but it wasn’t part of the decision.”Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionThe Boeing planes IAG ordered will be powered by the US company General Electric’s engines, meaning the contract would not have been subject to Trump’s new US tariffs even if a UK-US trade deal had not been struck. The Airbus aircraft will use Rolls-Royce engines.Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said on Thursday that an unnamed UK company would buy Boeing planes worth $10bn.IAG said the list price of each Boeing aircraft was approximately $397m, giving the deal a headline value of $12.8bn. The Airbus list price was $374m per aircraft. However, IAG said that it negotiated a “substantial discount” from the list price on each of the deals.“This order marks another milestone in our strategy and transformation programme and underlines our commitment to strengthening our airline brands and enhancing our customer proposition,” Gallego said.Separately, IAG said it had seen “some recent softness” in economy ticket sales by US holidaymakers in recent months. However, it said there was “strength” in premium tickets such as business class, which mitigated those effects.Gallego said: “We continue to see resilient demand for air travel across all our markets, particularly in the premium cabins and despite the macroeconomic uncertainty.”Aarin Chiekrie, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Tariffs had been weighing on sentiment towards the travel sector. But with 80% of flights for the second quarter already booked, the outlook is brighter than many expected.”",

            "content": "Toast and jam, bacon sandwiches and boiled egg with soldiers may be at the heart of traditional British food culture but bread is making up an ever thinner slice of our diet – putting pressure on some famous brands.While still one of the most ubiquitous items in shopping baskets, the popularity of the packaged sliced loaf has been sliding downhill since the Hovis lad puffed up a cobbled street with his bicycle to the strains of a brass band in the 1973 TV ad.Now Hovis’s owner, Endless, is in talks with the owner of rival Kingsmill – Associated British Foods (ABF) – about a possible merger of the bakery businesses, which together account for just under a quarter of the packaged bread market, after both have struggled to get out of the red for several years.ABF’s chief executive, George Weston, was saying back in 2017 that its bakery division was “making an unsustainable level of loss” as it faced commodity price inflation, even before the full invasion of Ukraine and an accelerating climate crisis supercharged the price of wheat.As one bakery insider puts it: “The packaged bread industry is in inexorable decline. An industry solution is needed.”Rising costs – from energy and transport to wheat and labour – have combined with pressure on sales as packaged bread faces increasing competition from a huge range of other options.Whether it’s starting the day with yoghurts and breakfast biscuits or protein pots, salad bowls, noodles and sushi for lunch, sliced bread is being sidelined amid trends for low-carb diets and concerns about ultra-processed foods.“Whenever a new breakfast or lunch option comes into the market, more often than not its bread that loses out,” says Kiti Soininen, the head of food and drink research at the market research firm Mintel.While only 3% of people do not buy bread at all, according to Mintel, only a third of us eat sliced loaf bread on a daily basis, down from about half in 2015, according to polling for the Grocer trade journal.The trend is even stronger among younger shoppers, with those 34 and younger now 15% less likely than average to buy wrapped bread, while those aged over 65 are 11% more likely to, according to grocery industry analysts Kantar.Mintel’s Soininen says younger people tend to go for “huge variety” in what they eat, ditching traditional favourites in search of new ideas such as protein shakes.While total bread sales are down, wrapped and sliced loaves are taking the biggest hit. The number sold in the UK has slumped 15% in the past five years, according to Kantar, while the volume of flatbreads sold has increased by 52% and pittas by 7%.Part of the pressure on the big brands is about price. An average branded bread loaf weighing 800g is now priced at £1.43, up almost a third from £1.10 on average in the year to April 2021.In the face of rising household bills, shoppers have increasingly switched away from brands to supermarkets’ own-label breads – which can be half the price. Own-label now accounts for just over two-fifths of the market.Supermarkets have responded to waning demand by reducing the amount of shelf space devoted to packaged bread so that they mostly stock only two of the major brands – adding to the pressure on Kingsmill, which had many product lines delisted by Tesco last year, and also Hovis.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionFraser McKevitt, the head of consumer insight at Kantar, says it is not all about price. The evidence is that shoppers are also switching to making fewer – but pricier – bread purchases, with the rising popularity of farmhouse-style loaves and sourdough, which are perceived as “better bread with more texture”.“A lot of people are thinking about [carbohydrate intake], and if they are going to have carbs, then they are going to have something that feels a bit less artificial,” he says.Soininen from Mintel agrees: “Premium, slightly more special things are doing well and those very competitively priced are doing well – it is those in the middle that are not.”Seemingly, bread cannot win – when times are good, households look to treat themselves with takeaway treats from companies such as Greggs or Pret a Manger while cash-strapped youngsters are increasingly minded to skip breakfast altogether.The fallout is there to see in the latest accounts available for Hovis, which reveal continued losses in a UK market that its directors said was “highly competitive”.It says that 2022 and 2023 proved “hugely challenging” amid “rampant levels of cost inflation in the UK and abroad” after the Covid crisis. “As a business we have absorbed significant inflationary pressures from rising energy bills and volatility in wheat/flour prices – impacted by the war in Ukraine and elsewhere,” they say.Sales at Hovis Group, which employs almost 3,000 people and about half of whom work in manufacturing, rose more than 50% to £489m in the year to 30 September 2023, helped by inflation. However, the company made a pre-tax loss of £3.6m after spending more than £2m on restructuring. The previous year it made a £29m loss.Meanwhile, ABF’s bakery division, Allied Bakeries – which includes Kingsmill, Allinson’s and Sunblest, incurs annual losses of about £30m despite sales of about £400m, according to analysts at Panmure Liberum.Both businesses are facing strong competition from the family-owned Warburtons, now the UK’s biggest bread brand, which has gained ground through innovation – from giant crumpets to seeded flatbreads. It is now understood to account for more than a quarter of packaged bread sold.Warburtons’ latest accounts show sales jumped by 17.4% to £711.3m in the year to 30 September 2023, and pre-tax profits soared nearly sevenfold to £34.3m from £5.1m a year before.A merger between the UK’s second- and third-largest bread brands is likely to attract scrutiny from the competition authorities, but as Anubhav Malhotraof the investment bank Panmure Liberum says: “The current level of market competition and the lossmaking status of the businesses involved support the case for approval.”He suggests that a “merger of equals” between Hovis and Allied is needed “to restore profitability and ensure long-term viability”.",

            "content": "George Orwell’s correspondence, contracts and readers’ reports relating to his earliest novels are among historic papers that have been saved for the nation after an outcry over their initial dispersal.University College London (UCL) said it had acquired the archive of the Nineteen Eighty-Four author’s publisher as “a valuable piece of Britain’s cultural heritage”.About 160 items, dating from 1934 to 1937, are to be added to the Orwell Archive in UCL Special Collections, the world’s most comprehensive holdings of research material relating to him.The papers offer extraordinary insights into one of the most influential British writers of the 20th century.They relate to four of his earliest published works – A Clergyman’s Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, The Road to Wigan Pier and Inside the Whale – and include his observations on the politics of 1930s Europe, which helped shape his thoughts and ideas.The collection had belonged to his publisher, Victor Gollancz, who founded one of the 20th century’s foremost publishing houses.The company was acquired by the Orion Group, which became part of Hachette, owned by the French multinational Lagardère, whose decision to sell the archive because its warehouse was closing was condemned last year as an act of cultural vandalism.Disbelief that such important papers had been languishing in dozens of rusty, dusty filing cabinets turned to anger with the realisation that they had been sold off.Rick Gekoski, a leading antiquarian bookseller, was asked to dispose of the Gollancz archive, which included correspondence with Kingsley Amis and Daphne du Maurier, among the publisher’s other authors. He recalled that the decision was sanctioned by Malcolm Edwards, the then publishing director of Orion, and the board. In his 2021 book, Guarded by Dragons, he wrote: “No one on the Orion board cared where they went, or to whom.”He had tried in vain to sell the entire archive to various institutions, before dividing it up between dozens of dealers, private collectors and libraries.He said among those approached was UCL, who, he recalled, declined partly due to funding – although it would have cost “considerably less” than the £154,000 that it has now paid.On being told that UCL denies it had been approached previously, he said: “Why wouldn’t we [approach them]? It’s the Orwell Archive.”Liz Thomson, who has reported on the book trade for 35 years, had warned of the loss of a “priceless” archive when she heard of its dispersal. She was dismayed to learn that one dealer had sold Gollancz’s Animal Farm correspondence, with an asking price of £100,000. It included Orwell’s 1944 letter describing it as “a little fairy story … with a political meaning”.The publisher’s sale was contrasted with the extraordinary generosity of Richard Blair, the son of Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair. In 2021, Richard purchased 50 letters to donate them to UCL’s Orwell Archive, fearing that they would otherwise have gone on to the market. “Then they’re never seen again,” he said.He said: “I’m very pleased and relieved that the Orwell Archive has taken [the Gollancz papers] and that they’ve not been dispersed into the ether, gobbled by various collectors, never to be seen again.”The new acquisition boasts manuscript notebooks, personal papers and the first handwritten notes of some of Orwell’s most famous words and phrases, such as “Two Minutes Hate”, “Newspeak”, and “War is Peace. Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery”.UCL’s purchase from Jonkers Rare Books and Peter Harrington Rare Books was made with support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Friends of the Nations’ Libraries.Sarah Aitchison, the director of UCL Special Collections, said the collection revealed the editing process behind Orwell’s published works and the legal anxieties that spurred amendments.She noted that Gollancz’s libel concerns run throughout the letters, with the publisher often requesting that Orwell change names and details to reduce similarities with real people, places and companies.The papers relating to Keep the Aspidistra Flying, for example, show his frustration over requested changes. He reluctantly conceded: “These alterations spoil the book altogether.”The Orwell biographer DJ Taylor said: “This is an absolutely fantastic treasure trove from the point of view of Orwell and publishing history … Literary manuscripts have a terrible habit of disappearing into the vaults of private collectors, never to be seen again, so it is wonderful that these can now be made available to everyone.”Last year, Prof Jean Seaton, the director of the Orwell Foundation, expressed astonishment that the publisher had failed to understand the archive’s value.She argued that such literary archives should not be dispersed to collectors who want “trophies”. \n “There are lots of people with lots of money who’d like a trophy. But you then lose track of them and they disappear, until they pop up on the market again.”Bill Hamilton, the literary agent and executor of Orwell’s estate, said of the acquisition: “We’re thrilled. Bit by bit, all this really important Orwell material is finding its way to UCL, where it should really be.”Orion declined to comment.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 14:00",
            "content": "The first step, they say, is admitting you have a problem, and on that front the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has made some much-needed progress. The agency, which is responsible for approving all clinical trials in the UK, has identified a “notable imbalance” in trials conducted between 2019 and 2023: there were nearly twice as many all-male trials as all-female trials.This imbalance is hardly surprising: as I documented in Invisible Women, my book on the female data gap, the failure to adequately represent women in clinical trials is a longstanding and global problem. The MHRA’s figures are also in line with a recent US analysis that found male-prevalent diseases receive nearly twice as much funding as female-prevalent diseases, both absolutely and relative to disease burden. So far, so disappointingly standard.Still, it’s not all bad news. When I originally looked into the clinical trial landscape in the UK back in 2018, I was shocked to find that we were something of an outlier when it came to tackling the data gap in women’s health – and not in a good way. Unlike the EU, the US, Canada and Australia, the UK stood out for its failure to say anything at all on the subject. There were no funding requirements, no approval requirements. We didn’t even collect any data to track the problem. In this context (not to mention the backdrop of the Trump administration’s swerve away from evidence-based research), the fact that the MHRA has – for the first time ever – conducted this research is extremely welcome.The analysis also found that 90% of trials included both sexes, which might on the face of it seem to be more good news . But here’s where it gets more complicated: the inclusion of both sexes in a trial by no means guarantees that researchers will consider any differences between the sexes. An analysis of 10 years of preclinical trials in the US showed that, although there was an increase in the number of studies that included both sexes, there was no proportional increase in analysis and reporting by sex. Meanwhile, across a range of disciplines, only 5-14% of studies examine outcomes by sex, and fewer than a third of the results from phase three trials are reported by sex in medical journals.One such trial, published in 2023 in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested an Alzheimer’s drug called lecanemab. You may have read about it: it was lauded across the international press as heralding “the beginning of the end” for Alzheimer’s disease. And indeed, it did sound exciting, not least because it was the first drug that had been found to reduce the rate of cognitive decline in patients. And, yes, the trial did include both sexes, but like the vast majority of Alzheimer’s research, and despite the well-documented sex differences in Alzheimer’s presentation and prevalence, it didn’t do any sex analysis.And here’s why that matters. The research paper said that lecanemab reduced the rate of cognitive decline in patients by 27%, from which a reasonable reader may conclude that it had this effect in all patients. But if you looked at the data by sex (which was only provided in a supplementary index) it in fact appeared as though the drug may have had this effect in no patients at all: for men, the mean rate of slowing was much higher (43%), while for women it was much lower (12%). If this data is correct, it’s a clear demonstration of why sex analysis matters for men as much as women: a muddy amalgamation of the numbers is serving no one.Unfortunately, because the trial was not set up to uncover sex differences, it’s impossible to know whether this disparity is a real effect, so this is no more than a frustratingly suggestive cautionary tale (although it’s worth noting that a subsequent analysis published last month, which ran 10,000 simulated trials using the study data, found that the sex difference only occurred randomly 12 times). But it is far from an isolated case. A favourite example of mine is the supposed unpredictability of muscle-derived stem cells, which seemingly promoted muscle regeneration on a whim, until someone thought to sex disaggregate the data and realised they weren’t unpredictable at all, it was just that male and female cells acted differently.The MHRA’s failure to communicate anything about sex analysis in the trials it studied is a major flaw in its research. More fundamentally, though, the MHRA data actually tells us very little about the representation of women in UK clinical trials at all, because including both sexes in a trial is also not a guarantee that both sexes are represented equally. Indeed, usually they are not.Cardiovascular disease, for example, is the number one killer of women globally. Women are 50% more likely than men to be misdiagnosed after a heart attack. We know far less about female-specific risk factors for developing heart disease, and most risk-prediction models are still based on predominantly male data – meaning that they systematically label high-risk women as low risk because they don’t fit a male pattern of the disease. But heart-disease trials are not generally exclusively male; it’s just the representation of women in them remains “dismally low”. How many trials in the MHRA’s dataset would merit the same description? We simply don’t know.The MHRA’s analysis is not perfect. Even in a study of sex-based gaps, there were significant sex-based gaps that leave us in the dark on crucial data points. The state of female representation in 90% of Britain’s clinical trials remains unknown; meanwhile, patients of both sexes are being let down by a failure to track sex analysis. All of which means that, from the perspective of the female data gap, this study has not been done well – but, still, I remain delighted that it has been done at all.Caroline Criado Perez is the author of Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for MenDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last year, after Jürgen Klopp announced his departure from Anfield, he was bookmakers’ and fans’ favourite to return to Liverpool, only to pledge another year to the club he joined in October 2022.Now, with Carlo Ancelotti expected to depart the Bernabéu, whatever the outcome of this season’s title race with Barcelona, the Italian linked with becoming Brazil’s first modern-day foreign national team manager, Alonso is expected to return to the club where he won a La Liga title and a Champions League winner’s medal as a player. Reports in Spain suggest a pre-contract agreement has been struck with the 43-year-old.Leverkusen officials revealed they had agreed to Alonso’s request to cut short his existing contract, which had been due to run until the summer of 2026. This season has seen them unable to repeat last season’s heroics, where only a defeat by Atalanta in the Europa League final denied Leverkusen a treble of trophies.On Sunday , Alonso’s team face Borussia Dortmund in their final home game of the season, having secured second place, although they are eight points behind crowned champions Bayern.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotion“It’s not the moment to talk about the future,” said Alonso. “Now we know, we want to have a proper farewell on Sunday for some players and for myself. We have to enjoy this moment with mixed emotions. We can be happy and proud of what we have achieved during this time. I’m very thankful from the first day to the last one. You’ve got the announcement finally after chasing it.”",

Delivering the accent at its most potent is rapper EsDeeKid, part of a vibrant UK rap underground going any which way after the drill years.Lines from his latest single Phantom – “blacked out like a phantom … got girls flocking all over cos I’m young, lit and I’m handsome” – come with catarrh-loosening k’s, as if he’s gobbing the words on to the pavement; “In a kush coma, EsDeeKid fried, I’m a fookin’ stoner”, from LV Sandals, is as satisfying an opening line as you’re likely to hear this year, Merseyside musicality emanating from every word.LV Sandals is EsDeeKid’s biggest track yet: a posse cut featuring two other new UK MCs, Fakemink and Rico Ace, each of them locking into the distorted lo-fi beat with inexorable rhythmic force. EsDeeKid and Rico Ace also link on Phantom as well as a couple of 2024 tracks: Palaces is a kind of drill/G-funk hybrid with more distinctive pronunciation (cameras is “camelers”) and a taunting sing-song hook, while Bally is as hyperstimulated as walking through a seaside arcade.EsDeeKid boasts that he’s handsome but you can’t tell from his permanently balaclava’d face, and critics will argue that he needs to reveal a bit more of himself in his lyrics, too – across his 11 tracks so far it’s all drugs, women, designer gear and more drugs. But the way he delivers those lyrics is supremely distinctive, and as his choices of sex music (Deftones) or cocktail (Baileys with a side of ketamine) indicate, EsDeeKid is a free thinker.

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 13:31",
            "content": "Ukrainian authorities claim to have busted a Hungarian spy ring operating on its territory, alleging that Budapest was collecting sensitive military data with one eye on a possible future incursion into the west of the country.Hungary’s foreign minister dismissed the accusations as “propaganda” and announced the expulsion of two Ukrainians described as “spies working under diplomatic cover” at the Ukrainian embassy in Budapest.The allegations will further test already fraught relations between the two neighbouring countries. While Hungary is a member of Nato and the EU, its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has been an outlier among European leaders, strongly critical of Kyiv and neutral towards Russia.The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said it had detained two Ukrainian military veterans as part of the operation, and claimed the network had engaged in the collection of information on military defences in the western part of Ukraine as well as sentiment among the local population. It published a video interrogation of one of the detainees in handcuffs, with his face blurred.The SBU said the spy ring was run by a “staff officer of Hungarian military intelligence” and that the operation was designed to uncover information about vulnerabilities in Ukraine’s defence of western regions.It claimed that one of the detainees, a 40-year-old veteran from the western Ukrainian town of Berehove, which has a majority ethnic Hungarian population, had been recruited in 2021 as a sleeper agent. It said he was “activated” by a handler in 2024 and asked to collect information. It alleged that at a meeting in Hungary the man received cash payment for providing information, as well as to help recruit more people to the network of informants.“By forming an agent network, foreign intelligence hoped to expand the range of information collection, including obtaining data from frontline and frontline regions,” the SBU said.The two detained suspects face charges of high treason, which could result in life imprisonment.Speaking at a press conference in Budapest, the foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said Hungary had not been presented with any evidence to back up the claims: “If we receive any details or official information, then we will be able to deal with this. Until then, I must classify this as propaganda that must be handled with caution.”In a Facebook video released later on Friday, he said: “Today we have expelled two spies from Hungary working under diplomatic cover at Ukraine’s embassy in Budapest.”An estimated 80,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Ukraine’s western Zakarpattia region. The language rights of the region’s people have long been a bone of contention: Orbán’s nationalist government says Kyiv does not make proper provisions for them to speak Hungarian in schools, while Ukraine has accused Orbán of instrumentalising the community as an excuse to follow Russian talking points about Ukraine and the war.Orbán has spoken out against continued sanctions on Russia and promised to block Ukraine’s EU accession route. Last summer, he infuriated other EU leaders when he visited Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin, shortly after Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency.Although no Hungarian government official has spoken openly about trying to seize territory from Ukraine, it is sometimes a topic of far-right discussion in the country. Russian state television has also frequently suggested Ukraine could fall apart, with Russia taking over the east of the country and Poland and Hungary dividing the western part.In some Hungarian-majority villages, the clocks are set to Budapest time and the most popular television channel is the Hungarian government-controlled M1, which often sharply criticises Ukrainian authorities and parrots Russian narratives. Many local people say they feel closer to Budapest than to Kyiv.László Zubánics, a history professor and the head of the Hungarian Democratic Federation in Ukraine, said in 2023 that it was a stereotype that ethnic Hungarians were not Ukrainian patriots, and said up to 400 were then fighting on the frontline and about 30 had been killed in action. However, he admitted that for many in the community, trying to balance the competing demands of Budapest and Kyiv was “like trying to dance along a tightrope”.",

In three meetings with ­Tottenham this season, including one in the Carabao Cup, they have been beaten three times.The manager’s introduction of Luke Shaw, Amad Diallo and Mason Mount in the 62nd minute of ­Thursday’s second leg against ­Athletic changed the game, Mount scoring twice and Diallo creating a goal for Rasmus Højlund as United came from 1-0 down to win 4-1.Mount returned from a long-term hamstring injury last month, Diallo came back last week after a serious ankle problem, and, with Matthijs de Ligt expected to be available after West Ham’s visit on Sunday after a muscle strain, Amorim could have a near full-strength squad for the final. He was asked whether there would be a dog-eat-dog mentality in the competition for a starting berth against Spurs.“Of course they will fight for the places. They will be ready, excited. And that is the good thing, not just the final, but also to prepare the games of the Premier League, with something in our mind that we can win. It’s going to be massive.”Amorim said he would avoid ­taking risks with players such as Mount, De Ligt and Diogo Dalot, who is working his way back from a calf injury, but insisted he would not temper ­training to make sure it is not too fierce. “I don’t have that in me,” he said. “I will always push forward, but of course I will try to manage everything. They don’t need a lot of load now, so the training is going to be soft in that department. But of course they will push each other.”United’s last game before the final is next Friday’s trip to Chelsea. Amorim was asked whether he may rest key players such as Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotion“I will protect the players that can get an injury,” he said. “Bruno doesn’t have the ­problem of [potential injury] but Harry has.

            "content": "Donald Trump has floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a weekend meeting as he looks to de-escalate the trade war.Top US officials are expected to meet a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first significant talks between the two nations since Trump provoked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports.The US president wrote “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B” on his social media account on Friday morning, referring to Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary.Bessent and Jamieson Greer, the US trade representative, will meet their counterparts in Geneva in the most senior known conversations between the two countries in months, the Trump administration announced this week. It comes amid growing US market concern over the impact of the tariffs on the prices and supply of consumer goods.No country has been hit harder by Trump’s trade war than China, the world’s biggest exporter and second largest economy. When the US president announced his “liberation day” tariffs on 2 April, China retaliated with tariffs of its own, a move that Trump viewed as demonstrating a lack of respect. The tariffs on each other’s goods have been mounting since then, with the US tariffs against China now at 145% and China tariffs on the US at 125%.Chinese trade with the US slumped in April even as its total exports beat forecasts, official figures showed, as trade representatives from both nations prepared to meet this weekend in the midst of a gruelling trade war between the superpower rivals.Exports to the US – one of China’s top trading partners – fell 17.6% in April, data showed. Against that backdrop, analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected exports to rise just 2% year-on-year last month. However, they beat expectations, coming in at 8.1%.“The damage of the US tariffs has not shown up in the trade data in April,” Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.“This may be partly due to transshipment through other countries, and partly because of trade contracts that were signed before the tariffs were announced,” he added.“I expect trade data will weaken in the next few months gradually.”Trade between the world’s two largest economies has slowed considerably since Trump’s rounds of tariffs on China. Levies on many Chinese products are now as high as 145%, with cumulative duties on some goods a staggering 245%.Beijing has responded with 125% tariffs on imports of US goods, along with other measures targeting American firms.Bessent and the trade representative Jamieson Greer are due to meet the Chinese vice-premier, He Lifeng, in Switzerland on Saturday and Sunday, marking the first talks between the superpowers since Trump unveiled his tariffs.On Thursday, Britain became the first to announce a deal with the US that reduces tariffs on British cars and lifts them on steel and aluminium, while, in return, Britain will open up markets to US beef and other farm products.But analysts said traders were more excited about the Republican leader’s comments on the forthcoming talks with China in which he hinted at easing the stiff measures aimed at the world’s No 2 economy.Trump told reporters that he thought the negotiations would be “substantive”, and when asked if reducing the levies was a possibility he said “it could be”.“We’re going to see. Right now you can’t get any higher. It’s at 145% so we know it’s coming down. I think we’re going to have a very good relationship.”Speaking on Friday, the deputy foreign minister, Hua Chunying, said China had full confidence in its ability to manage US trade issues.“We have no fear,” Hua told reporters, adding that the trade policy of the US administration could be sustained. “We do not want any kind of war with any country. But we have to face up to the reality. As you can see, people have full confidence in our capability to overcome all the difficulties … Ordinary people in the US already feel suffering from the tariff war.”April’s economic data showed that China’s imports beat expectations, dropping 0.2%, compared with the 6% slide analysts had estimated. Purchases from overseas were being closely watched as a gauge of consumer demand in China, which has remained sluggish.With Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 13:14",
            "content": "Donald Trump abruptly fired the librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, on Thursday as the White House continues to purge the federal government of those perceived to oppose the Republican US president and his agenda.Hayden was notified in an email late on Thursday from the White House’s presidential personnel office, according to an email obtained by the Associated Press. Confirmed by the Senate to the job in 2016, Hayden was the first woman and the first African American to be librarian of Congress.“Carla,” the email began. “On behalf of President Donald J Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as the Librarian of Congress is terminated effective immediately. Thank you for your service.” A spokesperson for the Library of Congress confirmed that the White House told Hayden she was dismissed.Hayden, whose 10-year term was set to expire next year, had experienced a political backlash from a conservative advocacy group that had vowed to root out those it deems to be standing in the way of Trump’s rightwing agenda. The group, the American Accountability Foundation, accused Hayden and other library leaders of promoting children’s books with “radical” content and literary material authored by Trump opponents.“The current #LibrarianOfCongress Carla Hayden is woke, anti-Trump, and promotes trans-ing kids,” the AAF said on its X account earlier on Thursday, just hours before the firing was made public. “It’s time to get her OUT and hire a new guy for the job!”Trump has been weeding out officials who he believes do not align with his agenda, from the justice department to the Pentagon and beyond. At times, the firings come after conservative voices single out officials for criticism.Earlier on Thursday, the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) was pushed out one day after he had testified that he did not agree with proposals to dismantle the organization. Trump has suggested that individual states, not Fema, should take the lead on responding to hurricanes, tornadoes and other such crises.At the Pentagon, more than a half-dozen top general officers have been fired since January, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen CQ Brown Jr. The only two women serving as four-star officers, as well as a disproportionate number of other senior female officers, have also been fired.The unexpected move on Thursday against Hayden infuriated congressional Democrats, who initially disclosed the firing.“Enough is enough,” said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, of New York, who called Hayden a “trailblazer, a scholar and a public servant of the highest order”.The Connecticut congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House appropriations committee, said Hayden was “callously fired” by Trump and demanded an explanation from the administration as to why she was dismissed.Sign up to This Week in TrumplandA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationafter newsletter promotion“Hayden has spent her entire career serving people – from helping kids learn to read to protecting some of our nation’s most precious treasures,” said Congressman Joseph Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House administration committee that oversees the library. “She is an American hero,” he said.The Library of Congress, across from the US Capitol in Washington DC, holds a vast collection of the nation’s books and history, which it makes available to the public and lawmakers. It houses the papers of nearly two dozen presidents and more than three dozen supreme court justices.It also has collections of rare books, images and troves of music and artefacts – such as a flute owned by President James Madison, which the singer Lizzo played in a 2022 performance arranged by Hayden.The Democratic leaders praised Hayden, who had been the longtime leader of Baltimore’s library system, for a tenure that modernized the library and made it more accessible.The House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, applauded Hayden as “an accomplished, principled and distinguished librarian of Congress”.“Donald Trump’s unjust decision to fire Dr Hayden in an email sent by a random political hack is a disgrace and the latest in his ongoing effort to ban books, whitewash American history and turn back the clock,” Jeffries said.“The Library of Congress is the people’s library. There will be accountability for this unprecedented assault on the American way of life sooner rather than later,” he said.Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, said he would serve as acting librarian of Congress “until further instruction” in a separate email seen by the AP.Hayden spoke recently of how libraries changed her own life, and opened her to the world. “Libraries are the great equalizer,” she posted on X during National Library Week last month.“And when you have a free public library in particular,” she said, it is an “opportunity center for people all walks of life, and you are giving them the opportunity to make choices on which information, entertainment and inspiration means the most to them”.",

            "content": "Ukho Ensemble Kyiv is Ukraine’s leading new-music group, founded in 2015 by the Italian conductor Luigi Gaggero. Since the Russian invasion of the country in 2022, its members have inevitably been dispersed and its activities curtailed, but it has continued to perform a wide range of 20th and 21st-century repertories outside Ukraine. This performance of what is one of Gérard Grisey’s most important achievements, and one of the finest scores of the final decades of the last century, is taken from concerts the group gave in Stuttgart in December 2022.Grisey completed Vortex Temporum, for two winds, three strings and piano, in 1996, two years before his shockingly sudden death. If the work that followed it, the extraordinary Quatre Chants pour Franchir le Seuil, suggested that Grisey’s music was about to enter a new phase that he did not live to explore, then Vortex Temporum is perhaps a stylistic end point, a masterly demonstration of the techniques and utterly lucid structural thinking that he had elaborated over the previous decade. What develops from a motif borrowed from Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé into a study in how musical time unfolds at different rates generates ideas of extraordinary expressive power along the way, whether it’s the piano solo in which the opening section climaxes, the unwinding chorale of the second part or the steadily accumulating third.The Ukho performance is bold, assertive and closely recorded, while the other easily available recording, performed by Ensemble Risognanze on the Stradivarius label, offers a different perspective, more delicate, more distant, but equally compelling; a score as masterly as Vortex Temporum can accommodate many different interpretations.",

            "content": "His new poems celebrate the extraordinary homes of the creatures tucked away, usually out of sight, within the verdant nooks and crannies of the Lost Gardens of Heligan.But during a stroll with the Guardian around the sub-tropical garden on the south coast of Cornwall, the poet laureate, Simon Armitage, explained how the pieces could also be taken as a plea for humans to slow down, think about the damage we are causing to the natural world and, hopefully, do something about it.“When I was first shown around, my first impulse was that I needed to write something about gardens and flowers,” he said. “But I was looking for another dimension, something a bit more secretive. It occurred to me that this location provides habitat for a lot of species of British wildlife and I think the unspoken theme is the fact that the animals I’m talking about are under stress.”In Dwell, Armitage uses elements of riddle and folklore to focus on a series of dwellings: the “twig-and-leaf crow’s-nest squat” of a squirrel’s drey, a beaver lodge’s “spillikin stave church” and a hive’s “reactor core”.Newts, swallows, bats and hares make an appearance and there is a poem about Heligan’s large “bug hotel” – said to be the biggest in the UK – written as if its inhabitants had left Tripadvisor-style reviews about it: “Would deffo recommend. Dreamland!”Armitage said he was pleased with the title of the book. “There’s definitely an invitation in the title. As well as it being about habitat and dwellings, I’m asking people to dwell on ideas and to be contemplative and to think more deeply.“You often hear that word in relation to being told not to dwell on something. ‘Don’t dwell on it – move on’. I wanted to invert that because I am asking people to dwell on ideas. Maybe that’s a response to this very fast-paced, short concentration span world that we’re living in, the age of social media where everything is just a quick glimpse of something and then you’re on to the next thing.“I may be asking people to slow down because that pace of life is not helpful to nature, it’s burning it up. I think there’s, even within that word and its implications for a change of pace, there’s an environmental plea.”The gardens date back to the mid-18th century but became swallowed by unchecked growth when many of its workers failed to return from the first world war. Over the last 30 years they have been carefully restored and Armitage was invited to visit and write a suite of poems about them.Armitage said: “I thought there was something very naturally poetic about this place, not just the kind of environment, but the backstory and the idea of lostness.“It’s exotic here, it’s otherworldly, and when you enter its space, you fall under its spell. I think you feel as if you’re in a very contained and discreet environment. It provides tunnels, there’s a jungle area down there; there are places where it’s quite manicured and cared for and there are other places which seem wild and a bit out of control.”Sign up to BookmarksDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories. Literary delights delivered direct to youafter newsletter promotionThree installations – a slate boulder, a “jungle” pond and an oak wood tunnel – have appeared within the 80-hectare (200-acre) garden bearing lines from Dwell, the idea being that visitors will come across poetry stashed in the gardens. “It’s a space outside of normal time and the busy working world. You can park all that at the door and become lost here, in a good way.”Armitage said he hoped that just as the animals had their dwellings, the poems would be “little dens and treehouses” for readers to inhabit. “Somebody once said about me as a writer that I had a child’s eye and I think they meant it as a criticism but I just took it as an enormous compliment,” he said.“I’ve always felt with the writers that I like that they continue to ask questions, they continue to be spellbound, to engage in wonder rather than becoming wise and knowledgable.”Armitage will appear at the inaugural Heligan Homecoming festival, from 13 to 22 June.Dwell by Simon Armitage (Faber & Faber, £10).

            "content": "Sex seems to be everywhere – in TV and films, the quagmire of porn online – but young people are increasingly not getting it in real life. The Next Steps longitudinal study following more than 16,000 people, by University College London, found that one in eight 26-year-olds still hadn’t had sex.Hence Channel 4’s new show, Virgin Island, which depicts a two-week “radical retreat” led by sexologists Danielle Harel and Celeste Hirschman and a team of experts. The 12 participants are all virgins, and their varied issues around physical intimacy are explored via therapies that include sex coaches stripping naked and encouraging participants to pleasure them. The hope being that sex might be something they get to experience in the next fortnight.“There is a stigma around it,” says Ben, one of the participants, when we speak. He was daunted about taking part in a TV show and outing himself as a virgin, but hopes it will help others. “There probably are quite a few people out there who have the same problems we’ve had. I don’t think it’s particularly uncommon nowadays.”It’s not that Ben, a civil servant, doesn’t attract women – he’s been on around 50 dates in the last 10 years, and has had girlfriends, but when it gets to a more intimate stage, he pulls away. “I just didn’t have the confidence, because I didn’t know what I was doing,” he says. Being bullied at school stripped his self-esteem – “it makes you feel like you’re not worthy of someone being interested in you” – and by the time he was at university he felt left behind sexually. To be a male virgin comes with its own challenges. People, he says, think that if you haven’t had sex, “you must be a weirdo”. Or that he’s a misogynist incel. “The actual technical meaning is ‘involuntary celibate’. That doesn’t help either; you get lumped in with them.”So he decided to take part in the programme: “I got to the stage where I thought I probably do need some sort of professional help.” Some of it was uncomfortable – there was a discussion on masturbation “which I found really weird, and I was pretty much silent the entire time”. But in a one-on-one session with a therapist, he touches and kisses her, apparently with no issues. “You do feel a bit self-conscious,” he says of the cameras. But overall it was a positive experience. “I’m more confident in myself. I realised I was emotionally self-harming – that when I used to get rejected, I thought I was ugly and repulsive, and no one could possibly be interested in me. Even when they were, I didn’t truly believe it. The show managed to banish that.”The 12 virgins are brought together on a Mediterranean island, fitted out with tents, therapy rooms (with comfortable sofas, all the better for reclining and touching) and bedrooms. In one of the first group workshops, Harel and another therapist share an intimate clinch up against a wall in front of everyone. “It was quite shocking,” says Ben. With the participants, though, he says, “they actually started with some tame stuff”. Tame, if still wildly awkward. The group are asked to write their “hottest” sexual fantasy, then read it out to the others. Another day, working on letting go of inhibitions, the participants are asked to get on all fours and explore their “inner animal”, prowling round a therapist doing the same, and rubbing up against each other, perhaps a bit of mounting. You don’t have to be a virgin to find this excruciating; you just have to be British.Perhaps more challenging, especially for some participants, are the one-on-one sessions where touch is explored. One woman is fine with a therapist’s hand on her knee but anything much higher and she says she feels like she might have a panic attack. Others are open to more – Hirschman straddles one participant (they’re both fully clothed) and some sexy moves ensue. Afterwards, beaming, he’s like a different person.The participants are also encouraged to work together by themselves, feeding each other fruit or taking turns to massage one another. Without the care and guidance of Harel and Hirschman, it can be tricky – one woman is casually unkind about another person’s body, wounding his confidence. But this is part of it, says Hirschman. “One of the things people need to learn in order to have intimacy is resilience, because they do have to survive rejection. One of the reasons so many of them were holding back is fear of something like that happening. I think he was able to make it through that experience. He just continued to blossom.”There are lots of reasons why intimacy is a challenge for people, say Harel and Hirschman. Shame is a big issue. “There’s so much exposure to different kinds of sexuality, but also to perfection,” says Hirschman. “Everyone shows themselves in their best Instagram mode, everything is very carefully curated, and it creates fear: ‘I have to be that perfect to be able to be seen or connect intimately.’ It creates body image issues. In order to feel good about connecting, you really want to feel good about your body, to feel ‘my body deserves pleasure, my body is lovable’. Pleasure happens in the body, and if we feel this disconnect, it’s really hard to create intimacy.” Increasingly extreme pornography, she adds, “intimidates people, who think: ‘Is that what sex is going to be like?’”People in their 20s – at 30, Ben is the oldest in the group – had their adolescence coincide with social media and smartphones. Older generations could experiment without the fear of being shamed by peers, or at risk of going viral. “We had a lot more opportunities for those social interactions,” says Hirschman, “and we were not so observed all the time. I think those natural processes of communication, talking, hanging out, are much less available to young people these days.” Touch, in general in society, is declining – people are wary it will be taken the wrong way, but this comes at a cost. People “don’t get this touch connection as much”, says Harel. Then the pandemic happened, she points out, creating further isolation.Hirschman and Harel, sex and relationship therapists who created their teaching method about 15 years ago, want to bring people back in touch with their bodies. “It’s about helping them feel more connected to what is inside, being more comfortable with all the experiences they have in their body,” says Harel. “Just talk therapy is not sufficient to create this kind of transformation, but experiencing and really feeling … bypasses just the ‘thinking’.” We’re on our phones, and in our heads. We have become, adds Hirschman, “very disembodied. Pleasure and sex and desire and arousal, all of those things come from the body.”Their own bodies can be therapeutic tools – in the first two episodes I’ve seen, both stroke, kiss and rub up against the participants in intense one-on-one sessions, all on camera. How do they cope with the awkwardness – an erection, for instance?“I don’t actually experience it as awkward,” says Hirschman. “It’s a natural progression of an erotic experience so it’s not like I ignore or acknowledge, it’s just: here we are in this experience together, and it feels good. It’s an expression of desire.” One of the more adventurous virgins is introduced fairly early on to a “surrogate partner therapist”, who, under the supervision of another therapist, can have sex with a client. “I think surrogate partner therapy is profoundly transformative,” says Hirschman. “For the folks who need to have that pace of trying something slowly with somebody who can really walk them through it, it is so helpful.” If it’s startling, in the show it also doesn’t feel exploitative, on either side.For participant Taylor, taking part was nerve-racking. “But I thought, why not? The worst that can happen is I get a free therapy session.” It felt good, she says, to think that if a viewer who identified with her issues could watch her, “it’s going to give somebody else the opportunity to maybe learn vicariously from me”. At 29, her virginity felt unusual in her age group, so it was comforting to meet others. “It felt like a little community, like we all had something in common, even though we all had different things to work on.” For Taylor, previous intimate experiences tended to be negative, with unwanted sexual contact. Sex education was lacking at her religious school, and Taylor only found out from a friend at university that women had orgasms. She was also realising she was bisexual.She has used dating apps, but this hasn’t been conducive to a positive first experience. “If somebody’s just looking for sex, there’s so many people who are happy to do that, so why would they wait however long it’s going to take me to be comfortable, when they could just find someone who’s ready now?” Sometimes she has told dates she is a virgin. “They think it’s either weird or hot.”In the show, Taylor becomes easily emotional – which wasn’t a huge surprise, she says. “I have big feelings, but I was like, I’m not going to cry – and immediately there’s tears. When it’s that focused on you and your needs for the first time, it is really stressful.” But the whole experience has been positive, she says. “It has changed life for me. I feel like I know myself a lot better. And I’m not willing to make myself uncomfortable for the sake of doing something I ‘should’ be doing.”Virgin Island is on Channel 4 on 12 May at 9pm.",

            "content": "In the days leading up to the A Million Lives book festival, things already seemed amiss. Grace Marsceau, the event organizer, messaged an attending author that the DJ was in the hospital and the company had no replacement. She owed the hotel “six figures” because the room block hadn’t sold out, according to messages.“Oh my gosh that’s awful!” author Sarah Zane responded. The excuses seemed unusual, but as a veteran of book events, Zane expected to deal with some mismanagement.“I started to get worried,” Zane said in an interview with the Guardian, “But I did not expect things to be so visibly wrong.”On a Discord channel for the event, Marsceau repeatedly assured everyone about the event. In January, she said ticket sales were already “in the high four hundreds and I am aiming to sell out”. By the end of April, she messaged that ticket sales were in the “high 500s low 600s”.Attendance estimates help authors decide how many copies of their books to bring to an event. The two-day festival at the Baltimore convention center cost writers $50-$150 for the table, which is in addition to the cost of gas, flights, hotel rooms and books. Many spent more than $1,000 to attend, they said, an investment these independent authors believed worth it to sell their books.“I make my whole living on events, this is my life blood,” said Kalista Neith, a popular dark romance author.Neith had agreed to attend as a featured author – meaning her hotel was covered and she’d receive a $1,000 payment. Her attendance also gave other authors confidence in the event. In total, about 100 authors signed up.“The second I saw that Kalista Neith and Perci Jay had signed on to this I was like, ‘OK, this is gonna be a good event,’” said Zane.But last week, Marsceau told Neith that the Hilton was not returning her calls so she was going to move her to a Days Inn. Neith didn’t mind. After check-in, the front desk informed her that Marsceau’s credit card to cover the room had been declined. When Neith called Marsceau, she said her identity had been stolen.By then, Neith had her doubts, but she’d already told her followers about the festival and left the hotel to get her table set up. As she and other authors arrived at the convention center, there was no signage to direct them to the event. Marsceau wasn’t there, and there weren’t any event staff or volunteers. The original map of booths was not up to fire code, a security guard informed them, so everything had to be rearranged that morning. There were no coverings for the booths or badges that are typical of any conference. When Marsceau finally arrived, Zane asked her why they didn’t have badges or wristbands.The badges had arrived “shattered”, Marsceau informed Zane. Later, she told attendees that she had memorized everyone’s faces and knew who was supposed to be there, according to interviews.When the festival finally got started on Friday, no one walked through the door. One talk had more authors on the panel (nine) than people in attendance (eight). A tattoo artist wasn’t provided with an electrical outlet and had to borrow a battery pack in order to work. And an advertised “content room” was just a bare room with a gray carpet.Some attenders, like Pilar Del Rey, a first-time author and mom of two who drove from Indiana said she was hesitant to be critical. When Marsceau asked her for feedback that day about the event, Alexander demurred.“It can be really scary as a first-time author to voice your concerns. You don’t want to be blackballed from other events,” she said.Other authors said in interviews they tried to convince themselves that Friday was just slow and things would improve. Instead, things only devolved further.On Saturday, the content room was shut down for “mechanical failure”, Marsceau told attendees. At a panel on LGBTQ+ diversity, the moderator left to take a phone call in the middle and then never returned. Attenders later recognized the moderator as Marsceau’s husband from a photo of the couple in a news story.It is unclear if Marsceau formally created a business entity for her company Archer Fantasy events or Archer management – the names her accounts use. The Guardian found no secretary of state filings that listed Marsceau as an officer or entities under those business names. Marsceau did not respond to multiple calls for comment.Despite the fiasco, Alyssa McCoy who owns a business selling book-themed drinkware and apparel was set on attending the Saturday night ball to celebrate her birthday that weekend. She and her friends got ready together in one of their hotel rooms while watching Twilight. “I was always going to the ball, I loved my dress,” she said.But when they arrived at the same brightly lit conference room as the event, there was no decor or music. A small cash bar and a plate of macarons were the only signs of a party. As they sat around in chairs, the security guard went home to retrieve his portable bluetooth speaker. They named him “DJ Steve” and took turns playing music from their phones.Neith was irate for her fans that had paid up to $200 for the ball when she arrived and saw nothing was there.“Me taking a loss because this was a rubbish event is one thing, but not delivering on anything for my readers is a completely different thing,” she said. “All I have is the trust of my readers.”Neith told Marsceau the event was unacceptable and instructed her to make a post promising refunds and to tag her in it.“Hi everyone, I want to issue a formal apology,” Marsceau said carefully in a video on Saturday as Neith stood nearby.Neith said she was “still in disbelief how bad this was and it wasn’t just cancelled”.Marsceau has said she will issue refunds by the end of the month and maintains that she sold 603 tickets, according to emails. In interviews, authors estimated 80-100 people showed up the entire weekend.",

            "content": "Deep disillusionment is now driving the public mood in Britain. People are desperate for competent government to handle issues like the cost of living, welfare and immigration. And they want people to be treated fairly and with dignity, whether they are asylum seekers, disabled people or pensioners. Yet on immigration, it is clear that No 10 has missed the memo.It remains convinced that the only way to get a hearing with Reform voters on asylum is to sound as tough as possible. Indeed, Labour has recently resorted to sharing footage of people being deported in handcuffs, and headline grabbing initiatives to ship asylum seekers whose claims fail to so-called return hubs in countries such as Albania.But this approach is simply wrong. It will not work. The only way to get a hearing with Reform voters on asylum is to deliver results.An immigration white paper expected on Monday will signal a further hardening of policy towards those seeking asylum. Already trailed is a planned crackdown on international students applying for asylum and higher English-speaking requirements for migrants and refugees settling here.What do all these policies have in common? They are kneejerk initiatives that will make no difference to whether or not people come to the UK seeking sanctuary. We know from our work at the Refugee Council that asylum seekers don’t make decisions based on the latest government announcement or new laws. They come because of family and community connections, as well as historic links with Britain and its mother tongue.What’s more, these plans won’t make any material difference to the lives of people voting for Reform. For the average voter, they are meaningless. What concerns them are boats coming across the Channel and asylum hotels that they see in their local areas. They’ve heard the government’s promise to close the hotels, but they’ve seen no progress.Delivering on this is where the government has a chance to rebuild trust. It must consider systemic solutions. The asylum housing challenge cannot be separated from the wider temporary housing challenge that has led to a number of councils teetering on the edge of the financial precipice. It needs rapid, whole-system reform.A Treasury review of procuring short-term residential accommodation could potentially identify a financing solution so that councils could procure the housing that is needed – not just for refugees and people seeking asylum, but for families facing homelessness. This would be bold, impactful policymaking that voters would actually be able to see for themselves.On the Channel boat crossings, too, the government could bring back trust by restoring a greater sense of order. “Smashing the gangs” involved in people-smuggling won’t work on its own. Instead, a multipronged approach is needed that includes cooperating more deeply with France and other European countries, as well as undermining the business model of the gangs by creating safe and legal options for refugees to apply for asylum in Britain. This combination of approaches – enforcement, cross-border cooperation and legal routes – worked in the US, as shown by the big decline in the number of irregular arrivals at the US-Mexico border in the final year of the Biden administration.Sensible, evidence-based policies like these are not only necessary to restore trust with disillusioned voters: they reflect the views of the average voter. An analysis by the opinion researcher Steve Akehurst shows “boring moderation is the order of the day” when it comes to immigration and asylum, as it doesn’t alienate either side of the voter coalition that was so vital to Labour’s general election victory.Not only will tough-sounding policies, headlines and slogans erode public trust when they fail to produce results, they will also have the effect of dangerously ramping up the temperature on the asylum debate. Less than a year since towns up and down the country were shocked by violence on the streets targeting refugees, we need responsible and sensible leadership, not the populist playbook.On Thursday, our political leaders marked VE Day. It was out of the horrors of the second world war that Britain built its asylum system, offering safety to people who had experienced the very worst suffering, regardless of how they reached our shores. Today, more than two-thirds of Britons are proud of the country’s role in taking in refugees since that war. That includes a majority of Reform voters.Britons have not lurched to the right on immigration. Britons are not anti-refugee. The public just wants to see a system that is fair, controlled and treats people with the dignity they deserve. Above all else, they are fed up with politicians overpromising and underdelivering. It’s time for some principled competence and far less populist performance.Enver Solomon is chief executive of the Refugee Council",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 13:00",
            "content": "Donald Trump has found a new target for his trademark mockery and dismissal: little girls.In comments at a 30 April cabinet meeting, the president seemed to dismiss the economic impact of his chaotic tariff regime on American consumers by citing girls as the primary complainants. “Somebody said, oh, the shelves are going to be open,” Trump said. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls. And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.”Trump is prone to odd non-sequiturs, but the dolls have become something of a sticking point. Onboard Air Force One on 4 May, he doubled down on his insistence that American girls should have fewer toys. “All I’m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, nine-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl, doesn’t need 37 dolls,” he told reporters. “She could be very happy with two or three or four or five.”In an interview with Kristen Welker of Meet the Press that same day, Trump again mentioned the dolls. “I don’t think a beautiful baby girl needs – that’s 11 years old – needs 30 dolls,” Trump said. “I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.” He went on to assert that American children also have too many pencils. “They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.”In some respects, the comments seem like a rare bit of honesty from the president: an acknowledgment of the reality that his tariffs will hurt consumers and lower the American their standard of living. With steep tariffs on many consumer goods, particularly those made in China, and supply chain issues caused by retailers and producers frantic attempts to offset the costs of the new tariffs, many common products – yes, including children’s toys – will become shorter in supply and steeper in cost. Because of Trump’s policies, it is indeed true that there will be fewer presents for children underneath American Christmas trees this year – a trend that is likely to continue for years to come if Trump’s trade war triggers an economic recession, as is widely expected. Americans themselves don’t have much say in this, but Donald Trump wants us all to know that he’s comfortable with us, and our children, having less.But the selection of dolls, in particular, as Trump’s stand-in for consumer prices reflects the gendered ideas about work, money and purchasing that animate Trump’s chaotic economic policy. After all, Trump did not talk about the impact of his trade regime on toy trucks or GI Joe action figures – and he certainly didn’t mention its likely impact on things like video games, basketballs, squat racks or protein powders. The tariffs will increase prices across economic sectors and hurt consumers of all kinds of goods. But Trump did not speak in general terms about those who might like to buy a house one day, or about who will be hurt by his tariffs on Canadian lumber, or about those who would like to be treated for their illnesses but who have to pay steeper prices for the medicines they need when tariffs hit pharmaceuticals. He didn’t talk about any of the consumption that Americans are uniformly agreed to think of as reasonable, dignified or aspirational. He chose, instead, something seen as trivial, childlike, and only for girls.The comments aim to cast the pain that consumers will face as ultimately feminine and frivolous, their complaints petulant and childlike. In this respect, Trump is drawing on a long tradition of economic rhetoric that aims to cast consumption as feminine, decadent and morally suspect – and to contrast it with the supposedly more manly and virtuous productive side of the economy. It’s a laughably stupid symbolism, one that only works for those deeply committed to their ignorance about how the economy actually works: in truth, everyone consumes, and people of all genders participate in the productive economy. But Trump does not argue based on the facts: he asserts dominance. And here, he casts those Americans who would complain about the economic pain that he is inflicting on them as feminine and hence as contemptible, deserving no more respect than spoiled children.The project of masculinizing the economy – perhaps especially at children’s expense – is one that the Trump administration seems to be pushing more broadly. Trump claims, despite the near-universal assertions of economists to the contrary, that his tariffs will shift the US away from the primarily female service sector industries that have dominated the American economy since the 1970s back to a more masculine manufacturing base.To this end, his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, a billionaire former CEO, went on MSNBC late last month to describe his vision for the future of the American worker. “It’s time to train people not to do the jobs of the past but to do the great jobs of the future,” Lutnick said, arguing that fewer people should be aspiring to bachelor’s degrees and should expect to occupy themselves in lower-skill factory work instead. “This is the new model, where you work in these kind of plants for the rest of your life, and your kids work here, and your grandkids work here.”This is the vision for your children’s future that the Trump administration wants to put forward: deprived of material comforts and joy in childhood, then deprived of the hope for upward mobility in adulthood. They want you, and your kids, to be poor, desperate and ignorant. They want you to work in repetitive, dangerous, back-breakingly physical jobs, and they want you to have no aspiration to anything better. They want you to imagine your future, and your children’s futures, not as an open horizon of freedom and potential, but as a dark and desperate struggle, devoid of the notion that we might be anything more than useful instruments for the needs of capital. What do they offer Americans as compensation for this loss? Virtually nothing, aside from misogynist contempt, and the assurance that as our living standards sink and our prospects disappear, in our suffering, at least, we are masculine.On Fox News this past Tuesday, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, tried to put this spin on things. Describing what he would say to a little girl who would be denied dolls because of Trump’s tariff policy, Bessent insisted that it was for her own good. “I would tell that young girl that you would have a better life than your parents,” Bessent said. But the Trump administration is doing everything in its power to ensure that America’s children – and in particular, its little girls – have it worse.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist",

            "content": "In April 2013, Nudrat Afza, a Muslim woman from Bradford, gave her 90-year-old Jewish friend Lorle Michaelis a lift to the local Orthodox synagogue. “As Lorle got out of the car, she told me it would be the last service,” Afza recalls. “There were no longer enough people to run them. I was shocked. I knew the building would be sold or demolished.”Afza got out of the car and took a few quick photos of the synagogue’s exterior. Months later, she happened to be passing when the caretakers were coming out. “I put my foot in the doorway and took some pictures inside, to quickly record what was there,” she says. The Orthodox synagogue was sold and redeveloped in 2015. Afza didn’t know it at the time but the photos were the start of a multi-year project to document Bradford’s declining Jewish population. “I grew up looking at pictures of the 1960s civil rights movement in the US, the Vietnam war and other political struggles in Britain and south Asia,” Afza explains. “I saw the importance of documenting something before it disappears.”It had previously looked as though the Bradford Reform Synagogue, in the diverse inner-city area of Manningham where Afza lives, might also go the same way. In 2011, the Grade II-listed building needed extensive work to fix a leaking roof. When the synagogue’s remaining few members couldn’t afford repairs, the Muslim community stepped in to donate funds, which was followed by a £103,000 National Lottery Heritage Fund grant. Built in 1880-1881, the Reform Synagogue is now the only remaining synagogue in Bradford, with about 30 members.Afza’s photos from the synagogues and Scholemoor Cemetery, all shot on film using vintage cameras, are collected together in her new book, Kehillah (Hebrew for “congregation” or “community”). She’s keenly aware that “a Muslim woman taking photographs of the Jewish community” might jar with the common narrative that Jews and Muslims don’t get along. “In Bradford, people from different communities respect each other,” she tells me. “When I came to Bradford, when I was 10, I was aware of other religions, as well as my own, and we had nothing but respect for that. I was aware I was an outsider, so I was sensitive to what I did and how I did it.”Kehillah has an elegiac quality. “A lot of the people have died since the photographs were taken,” says Afza. “When I came on the scene, you could count on your fingers the Jewish people at Bradford Reform Synagogue’s Saturday services. I felt that if it wasn’t recorded, it would disappear.”Born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in 1955, Afza moved to Bradford in 1965. By chance, she picked up a camera in the mid-1980s. Simon Beaufoy, the Oscar-winning screenwriter behind The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire, later saw Afza’s Salon series – a project documenting the final year of a local establishment, Kenmore Salon, before it was sold in 2012 – and got in touch to offer his support. “[Beaufoy] told me that I have talent and gave me a Hasselblad XPan camera.”Afza’s documented others slices of northern life, including female football fans in Bradford City’s stadium (City Girls), derelict buildings (Ruins Oof Bradford) and a personal project, Cancer: Shadow Aand Light, which followed her sister Sairah’s treatment for breast cancer. Afza’s work was produced during tightly restricted intervals: a mother of two, she spent more than three decades as a full-time carer for her daughter, Khadijah, who was born with a life-threatening liver condition. “With the Salon pictures, the hospital was right across the road from the salon, so I’d leave my daughter in hospital and say, ‘I’ll be right back’, and go off and take some photos.” Khadijah died in January 2025, aged 35. “With my first pictures that I took, she was in my arms, very poorly, in hospital,” Afza remembers. “I’m a bit of a recluse, so whenever I got my contact sheets, she was always the first person who saw them. She would look at them and tell me which ones she liked.”This year, Bradford is the UK city of culture. The place has been known in the past for racial tensions but Afza hopes it’s on the up. “I love Bradford,” she says. “There’s a wide range of communities today and they do their best to work together and make the most of things. It just needs a lot of money pumped into it: schools, hospitals … Looking after my daughter in the hospital, we were on the receiving end of a lack of resources and expertise. Despite that, I’m optimistic for Bradford.”Kehillah by Nudrat Afza is published by Dewi Lewis (£30) The Kehillah photographs will be exhibited at the Dean Clough Galleries, Halifax, 16 August to 19 October.Chanukah ServiceBradford Reform Synagogue, Bradford, 2018This is a photograph of Suzie Cree, the chair of trustees at the Bradford Reform Synagogue, taken at the end of a Chanukah service. It was taken very late in the evening. Everybody else had gone home. I saw Suzie come to blow the candles out. The photo captures a moment in time and resonates with the decline in numbers of Jewish people in Bradford.CoveredBradford Reform Synagogue, Bradford, 2018\n “The men do this when they come to the synagogue. They’re covered by the Tallit prayer shawl, as a way of expressing reverence and awe of God during prayer. It’s put right over the head and a blessing is recited: ‘Blessed are you, Adonai, ruler of the universe who has commanded us to wear the Tallit,’ which is then lowered to the shoulders. I think it’s an image that the outside world doesn’t see.”Jewish Burial SpaceJewish burial space in Scholemoor Cemetery, Bradford, 2018\n “The cemetery contains the tombs of Jewish people from many generations who lived in Bradford. The picture is just so evocative. I like the shape of the photograph, with the ground covered in frost, the trees with their branches and leaves, and the mist creating an eerie atmosphere. It’s quite a mournful image. It looks beautiful and haunting at the same time.”TabletBradford Reform Synagogue Bradford, 2018\n “I took this as I was walking past the two children – just one snap. Initially, when you look at the image, your reaction is that they’re praying. But, in fact, they have a modern gadget and they’ve both got earphones in – they’re watching or listening to something on their tablet.”TorahBradford Reform Synagogue, Bradford, 2018”This is the Torah being unrolled to select the reading for the Shabbat service. The Torah is the Jewish sacred text. This Torah is about 150 years old. Its staves are made of wood and the scroll is adorned with silver. As a photographer, I wanted to capture these details.”Day of Atonement (main image)Bradford Reform Synagogue, Bradford, 2018”I absolutely love this picture. It’s taken on the Day of Atonement or, in Hebrew, Yom Kippur. There’s modern and old mixed together – you have the old architectural details in the background and the electric menorah on the right-hand side, which gives a surreal feel to the picture. It’s not posed or contrived.”",

He added that the art dealer had read news reports referring to sanctions against Ahmad and was party to conversations in which it was said his links to Hezbollah were common knowledge.Harris told the court: “At the time of the transactions, Mr Ojiri knew Mr Ahmad had been sanctioned in the US. Mr Ojiri accessed news reports about Mr Ahmad’s designation and engaged in discussions with others about his designation.“There is one discussion where Mr Ojiri is party to a conversation where it is apparent a lot of people have known for years about his terrorism links.”Harris said Ojiri “dealt with Mr Ahmad directly, negotiated the sales of artwork and congratulated him on those sales”.US prosecutors say Ahmad was a “major Hezbollah financial donor” who used high-value art and diamonds to launder money and fund the group. He is accused of evading terrorism sanctions by using front companies to acquire more than $160m (£120m) in artwork and diamond services.After new money laundering regulations were introduced in January 2020 that brought the art market under HMRC supervision, Ojiri is said to have discussed the changes with a colleague, indicating awareness of the rules.District Judge Clarke granted bail but ordered Ojiri to surrender his passport and not to apply for international travel documents.Ojiri will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 6 June. The offence carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.",

            "content": "This article contains major spoilers, so do not read if you have not watched Thunderbolts*. There was always something deeply suspicious about that asterisk, and now the word is out. If you’ve been to see it during the past week, you’ll know that the motley crew of antiheroes and sometime superheroes led by Florence Pugh’s Yelena Belova and David Harbour’s Red Guardian may well be the New Avengers.The problem is that even with the cat out of the proverbial bag, there’s something off here. First of all, the Avengers are supposed to be Earth’s mightiest heroes, a crew of idealists and icons who are never happier than when punching the likes of Thanos in the face and delivering heartfelt monologues about sacrifice and teamwork. The Thunderbolts*? They’re the last people you’d call if you were being invaded by Chitauri, Ultron, or even a moderately aggressive Roomba. This bunch of emotionally unstable grudge-holders are less “Earth’s mightiest” than “Earth’s most accessible”.Second, Marvel knows this. If Thunderbolts* is about anything, it’s about how a group of third-rate superheroes, reformed assassins and sad sacks come together to save the day because nobody else was around. In terms of IP exploitation, this one’s up there with that Disney+ series about Hawkeye and the time Marvel thought it would be a good idea to hire Angelina Jolie as a warrior goddess with memory loss, then somehow forget to give her a storyline.Of course, the studio has been here before. Nobody had heard of any of the Guardians of the Galaxy before James Gunn somehow delivered a trilogy of well-received films about a bunch of space idiots shouting at each other in slow motion over staples of 1970s AM radio. Marvel’s 1960s heyday was built on the then outlandish riff that superheroes might be just as flawed and existentially constipated as the rest of us. Their imperfections are what make characters such as Iron Man and Spider-Man worth investing in, while Thor is only ever even remotely interesting when he drops the whole invulnerable space god thing and reveals he’s really just a lightning-powered metaphor for fragile masculinity.But Thunderbolts* feels different, because this new crew are not so much relatably flawed as completely broken. They’re not charmingly dysfunctional – they’re emotionally unavailable, morally compromised and in at least two cases (Sebastian Stan’s Bucky Barnes and Hannah John-Kamen’s Ghost) a bit bored to be here. There’s no sense that they want to be a team, nor that we should want them to be one. The joke in the Thunderbolts* end-credits scene is that Captain America (Sam Wilson) has already been in touch to complain that they’re infringing on his copyright. It’s as if Marvel has anticipated every brickbat – that Thunderbolts* is a cynical rebrand, that the team have no chemistry, that they’re just cosplay Avengers with unresolved trauma – and made sure to get in there first.And yet perhaps this willingness to punch itself in the face before anyone else does is what has led the new film to emerge as one of the best-received episodes in the studio’s recent history. It’s hard to accuse Marvel of making a cynical cash grab when they seem to be actively undermining themselves for kicks at a time when the MCU has been lurching from flops to reshoots to box office faceplants. It’s as if the studio is challenging every critic of superhero films to watch this new one and witness a machine that has decided there is nothing left but to cheerfully eat itself while the world looks on.Naturally, the smart money is on this cavalcade of misfits, also-rans and never-weres finding themselves sidelined when the real heroes roar back in Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars. And yet there’s a sneaking suspicion that Marvel wouldn’t have cast actors of the calibre of Pugh and Harbour if they were only intended to act as narrative duct tape to hold Phase Five together until Spidey and the X-Men sort out their scheduling conflicts. The question now is how Marvel creates a future that lives up to the euphoric buzz of the studio’s first decade, while honouring the strange, broken little corner of the universe it’s spent the last few years quietly assembling. Like it or not, the Thunderbolts* – sorry, New Avengers – are in the system now. And in the multiverse, nobody ever really gets written out.",

            "content": "Southern and south-eastern Europe have experienced a spate of thunderstorms that have resulted in significant rainfall and hail across parts of the Balkans. After a hot start to May in the area took temperatures into the high 20s celsius, thunderstorms widely developed from Monday.One particular thunderstorm, which developed over Slavonski Brod in Croatia, reportedly brought egg-sized hail, with 38.2mm of rain being recorded.Farther east, in the Bulgarian city of Burgas, storms on the Wednesday brought 1cm hailstones that coated the ground white, while 22.7mm of rain was recorded. The storms across Burgas also brought notably strong winds with a gust of 62.6mph (100.8km/h) recorded at the city’s weather station.India, and specifically Mumbai, also experienced further thunderstorms in the past week when heavy showers developed over the city on Tuesday evening. The rainfall brought welcome relief from the recent oppressive heat, but also disrupted the road and rail networks.Heavy rain and 50-60km/h gusts hit several Mumbai suburbs, including Borivali, Kandivali, Malad, Andheri and Bandra. The conditions caused train delays of up to 20 minutes due to debris on the overhead equipment, while the intense rainfall caused flash flooding on parts of the road network.The stormy conditions continued into Wednesday and Thursday, with 24.5mm of rain recorded in Mumbai in a five-hour period on Wednesday evening, almost four times the city’s average rainfall for the whole month of May. The heavy rain also brought about unusually cool temperatures for the region, with a minimum of 20.6C recorded at the Santacruz weather station in Mumbai. This was the second lowest temperature recorded there in the month of May since records began.The rain was caused by monsoon-like atmospheric conditions due to a low-pressure system across the region; this led to an incursion of moisture in the atmosphere that was further aided by westerly winds off the sea. This led to more moisture and therefore more instability in the atmosphere than usual, resulting in the widespread thunderstorms.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 12:24",
            "content": "Despite the pronouncements of veteran Vatican-watchers, the rash of profiles and the raking over of old statements, very few people seem to know exactly where Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost – now known as Pope Leo XIV – stands on the big issues of the day.But one person who has a better idea than most is the new pontiff’s elder brother John Prevost.In a recent interview with the New York Times (NYT), the 71-year-old retired teacher noted his brother’s emotional and ideological proximity to his friend Pope Francis and said he shared Leo predecessor’s concerns about the US’s immigration policy.Prevost described his brother as middle-of-the-road, adding: “I don’t think we’ll see extremes either way.” He also said the new pope would not hesitate to speak out against injustices. “I don’t think he’ll stay quiet for too long if he has something to say.“I know he’s not happy with what’s going on with immigration. I know that for a fact. How far he’ll go with it is only one’s guess, but he won’t just sit back. I don’t think he’ll be the silent one.”Francis made no secret of his opposition to Donald Trump’s border and mass deportations plans, and also took issue with the US vice-president, JD Vance’s interpretation of the church’s teaching on our responsibilities to others.During a visit to Mexico in February 2016, Francis criticised Trump’s plan for a border wall between the US and its southern neighbour.“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,” he said. “This is not the gospel.”Although his intervention angered Trump – who said it was disgraceful for a religious leader to question someone’s faith – Francis refused to hold his tongue.In a letter to Catholic bishops in the US three months ago, the late pope described Trump’s mass deportations as a major crisis that was damaging “the dignity of many men and women”.Francis also sought to correct claims by Vance that the US government’s actions were justified by a concept from medieval Catholic theology known as ordo amoris, or rightly ordered love. Vance had invoked the concept to suggest there was a clear hierarchy of care and that compassion should be focused on one’s community and fellow citizens before it was extended to the rest of the world.“Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,” the pope said in his letter to the bishops. “The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the Good Samaritan, that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, acknowledged the pontiff’s criticism, but said he would continue to defend his views. During an appearance at the national Catholic prayer breakfast in Washington DC in February, he called himself a “baby Catholic” and acknowledged there were “things about the faith that I don’t know”.Hours after Prevost was elected pope, many seized on posts from an X account apparently belonging to the cardinal that criticised Trump and Vance’s positions. One post shared an article from the National Catholic Reporter, headlined “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others”. Another reposted a report on California Catholic bishops complaining that Trump’s use of the phrase “bad hombres” to describe some Mexicans fuelled “racism and nativism”.Trump was among the first world leaders to hail Pope Leo’s appointment. “It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American,” he wrote on Truth Social. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”Some of the US president’s supporters, however, were less thrilled by the news.The far-right political influencer Laura Loomer wrote on X: “He is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis. Catholics don’t have anything good to look forward to. Just another Marxist puppet in the Vatican.”Last week Steve Bannon, one of Trump’s most outspoken Catholic allies, highlighted Prevost’s ideological closeness to Francis, noting that he was one of the most progressive candidates and “one of the dark horses” of the conclave.The Maga faithful will have found little comfort in John Prevost’s effort to sum up his brother and his stances.“The best way I could describe him right now is that he will be following in Francis’s footsteps,” he told the NYT. “They were very good friends. They knew each other before he was pope, before my brother even was bishop.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 12:23",
            "content": "Deep in the woods that inspired the Brothers Grimm, past the tower from which Rapunzel threw down her hair and the castle in which Sleeping Beauty slumbered, lies a construction site that the far right has declared a crime against national soil and identity.In this quiet corner of Germany’s “fairytale forest”, workers are clearing land and building access roads to erect 18 wind turbines.The trucks rumbling through Reinhardswald have won the cautious backing of conservation groups, who consider the clean energy the turbines will generate a worthy trade-off for the 0.07% of forest they will physically occupy. But the project has divided local people and become a flashpoint for the far right, whose opposition to wind turbines has grown increasingly venomous in recent years.At an Alternative für Deutschland conference in January, a few weeks before the party doubled its vote share to become the second-biggest force in parliament, its co-leader Alice Weidel promised to “tear them all down” if the AfD came to power.“Down!” she cried to thunderous applause. “Down with these windmills of shame!”Attacks on renewable energy and policies to reach net zero pollution have become a core pillar of far-right campaigns across the developed world. Although Weidel later said she had called to tear down only the wind turbines in Reinhardswald, rather than all those in Germany, her tirade marks a broader political opposition to wind power that is hardening as the energy transition picks up pace in Europe’s biggest polluter.Wind turbines generated one-third of German electricity last year but have come under repeated attacks from the centre-right and far-right parties that won the most votes in February’s election. Friedrich Merz, the conservative leader who became chancellor on Tuesday, has described them as an “ugly” bridge solution that could one day be dismantled. The AfD, which German intelligence agencies classified as extremist last week, has made opposition to wind turbines a persistent addition to campaigns that typically focus on migration and crime.In the most extreme circles, the tone has escalated to Nazi-era “blood and soil” rhetoric that has fallen on fertile ground. Hardline opponents see Reinhardswald as a symbol of a patriotic struggle against elitist climate policy, which they say has trampled over the native soil of the “fatherland”.“Green ideology is globalist and ultimately rootless,” reads one Telegram post opposing the windfarm from Junge Alternative, the extremist youth wing of the AfD that was disbanded in March, and which was shared by Björn Höcke, a leading AfD figure who was fined last year for using a Nazi slogan. “They cannot see what is obvious to us patriotic youth: nature protection begins in nearby, native spaces.”Around the world, huge public support for stronger climate action – as much as 89% of the global population – is failing to translate into swift cuts to pollution in the face of pushback from powerful actors and public opposition to the trade-offs in specific policies.In Germany, researchers have found voters of all parties except the AfD are overwhelmingly in favour of expanding wind power – but support fell by 40 percentage points when people were asked about building wind turbines in forests.Supporters of the windfarm in Reinhardswald, in the densely forested state of Hessen, complain the political debate has been poisoned by widespread misinformation. Ralf Paschold, the chief executive of Windpark Reinhardswald, said far-right opponents had spread “horror images” of the entire forest being torn down and replaced by huge industrial windmills.They also misrepresent the health of the forest, he said. Rather than felling swathes of gnarled oaks in protected woodlands, two-thirds of the project area covers commercial spruce monocultures, planning documents show. The trees have already been ravaged by droughts, storms and bark beetle infestations that have been made worse by planet-heating pollutants.“These wind turbines will help preserve the forest by generating electricity sustainably,” said Paschold. “If we keep spewing CO2 and contaminating our atmosphere, there won’t be much of it left.”Local opponents of the windfarm, which is the subject of several legal challenges aimed at halting construction, argue supporters have understated the project’s impact on an already fragile ecosystem and called for wind power to be placed outside of woods. But they are also uncomfortable with interventions from far-right actors who they say have coopted their democratic protest.Sign up to Down to EarthThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essentialafter newsletter promotionOne local protest group, Save the Reinhardswald, said members of the AfD had posed with their banners for photoshoots and TikTok videos, while the neo-Nazi Third Way party had posted its online content on social media as if it were its own. The campaigners said their own credibility had suffered as a result of viral false claims about the project spread by far-right politicians “who do not seem to have even read the planning permission”.“It’s completely brazen,” said Annette Müller-Zitzke, an occupational therapist and member of Save the Reinhardswald. “They portray themselves as saviours of the Reinhardswald solely for their own benefit, to pursue their own political goals, ultimately at the expense of the forest.”Tensions between cutting carbon pollution and protecting local wildlife have grown across Europe as the best sites for renewable energy projects have been snapped up. Permitting changes taken under the last German government, which designated wind power a matter of “overriding public interest” in line with EU efforts to ditch Russian gas faster, have made it quicker and easier for developers to get clean energy projects approved.Bärbel Heidebroek, the president of the German wind lobby, said the wave of opposition to wind projects was “not necessarily a threat to the industry, but there is of course an acceptance problem”.“We see this in particular with wind parks in eastern German states, with massive protests that often aren’t carried out in a civil and fact-based way,” she added.Campaigners have raised fears of the heightened rhetoric spilling over into violence as far-right forces have gained ground across the country and increasingly directed their anger at climate activists and the German Green party. In Reinhardswald – near the city of Kassel, where in 2019 a neo-Nazi murdered Walter Lübcke, a conservative mayor who supported immigration – locals say there has been a creeping rise in the extreme fringe of far-right activity.In 2020, a neo-Nazi bought an old hotel on the outskirts of the forest to host far-right events. Local people have spotted members of the Reichsbürger movement, which has plotted to violently overthrow the German state, walking through the forest in black jackets and heavy military boots. Forestry officials have taken down signs declaring the forest to be their property and under the protection of Germanic tribes.“With a focus on February 2025, an increasing number of rightwing extremist stickers were found on hiking trail markings in Reinhardswald,” a spokesperson for the state-owned company HessenForst said.Müller-Zitzke, the local campaigner, said mainstream parties had ignored issues they had raised about the wind park in Reinhardswald, leaving space for far-right actors to push their own narrative.“The AfD comes in and tells people their outrage is justified,” she said. “You cannot leave these topics to such people.”",

            "content": "Two friends who embarked on a “moronic mission” to fell the Sycamore Gap tree with a chainsaw have been found guilty of “mindless” criminal damage.Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, cut down the cherished tree, next to Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland, as Storm Agnes raged in the early hours of 28 September 2023.They saw it as a “bit of a laugh” and afterwards “revelled” in their infamy as the crime made headlines around the world, a jury was told. They thought themselves “big or funny or clever”.Neither Graham nor Carruthers showed any visible emotion as guilty verdicts were delivered on Friday morning. It took the jury five hours to reach the unanimous verdicts.The judge, Mrs Justice Lambert, said she would pass sentence on 15 July, by which time pre-sentence reports would be ready. Remanding both men into custody she said they could face “a lengthy period” in jail.After the verdict, the Woodland Trust called on the government to bring in new legislation to ensure important trees are listed for protection like historical buildings are.Both men denied charges of criminally damaging the tree and the wall it stood beside, a Unesco world heritage site.They said they were at their homes in Cumbria at the time of the felling.This was despite evidence showing that Graham’s car and phone were used in the crime. Both men had footage of the felling on their phones. The court heard they later exchanged messages about the headlines being generated by it.The pair were found guilty after an eight-day trial at Newcastle crown court.The prosecutor, Richard Wright KC, said the crime was a “moronic mission” and the “arboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery”, and that the two men showed a “basic lack of decency and courage to own up to what they did”.He said: “Up and down the country and across the world, the reaction of all right-thinking people to the senseless felling of the Sycamore Gap tree has been one of sadness and anger. Who would do such a thing? Why would anyone do such a thing? Take something beautiful and destroy it for no good reason.”He said the “public indignation, anger and downright disgust” at the felling had been palpable. “Far from being the big men they thought they were, everyone else thought that they were rather pathetic.”The jury heard the men deliberately chose a stormy night to fell the tree because strong winds make it easier to topple a big tree.One of them filmed the felling on Graham’s iPhone, footage that was enhanced by police and shown to the jury.Wright said the men’s technique showed “expertise and a determined, deliberate approach”.Sign up to Headlines UKGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningafter newsletter promotionA wedge of the trunk, removed as part of the felling process, was taken as “a trophy”. It has never been recovered but video footage and a photograph of it in Graham’s car boot was on his phone.Wright said that as the world’s media began reporting on the tree’s felling, the men shared social media posts, with Graham messaging Carruthers: “Here we go.”Graham, who ran a groundwork business near Carlisle, told the court Carruthers was responsible and must have borrowed his car and phone while he was asleep in his caravan after taking a sleeping pill.Carruthers, a mechanic living in a caravan in Kirkbride, said he was not at the site of the crime. His barrister, Andrew Gurney, said it made no sense for a man to be “gallivanting around the national park cutting down Sycamore Gap” just five days after his partner had left hospital with their newborn baby.The case had cast light on the need for heritage trees to have extra protection, the Woodland Trust said after the verdicts. It is calling on the government to back a private member’s bill put forward by Lady Young in the House of Lords that would allow for the listing of heritage trees.The trust’s head of campaigns, Adam Cormack, said the proposed law would provide “a consistent level of protection, conservation and active stewardship” for several thousand of the most important trees across England.The National Trust, which owns the land at Sycamore Gap, said it was focused on “creating a positive legacy for the tree”. A spokesperson said: “The needless felling of the Sycamore Gap tree shocked people around the country and overseas, demonstrating the powerful connection between people and our natural heritage.“It was felt particularly deeply here in the north-east of England, where the tree was an emblem of the region and the backdrop to many personal memories.”Supt Kevin Waring of Northumbria police said: “We often hear references made to mindless acts of vandalism – but that term has never been more relevant than today in describing the actions of those individuals. At no point have the two men given an explanation for why they targeted the tree – and there never could be a justifiable one.”",

            "content": "Chain smoking under the fluorescent lights of a cavernous billiards hall in Beijing, Brother Yuan can’t stop smiling. The previous day, along with 150 million other people across China, he had been at home watching the snooker world championships final. Now he’s with his fellow cue-heads, celebrating the win of China’s first snooker world champion, Zhao Xintong.“He’s a great role model for young people in China,” Yuan, 55, says of the generation Z upstart who on Monday claimed snooker’s top prize. “He’s bringing the excitement back.”It’s a far cry from the 1980s when Yuan was a young player in Beijing with dreams of going professional. The industry wasn’t well developed and the money wasn’t there. He remembers vividly the 1987 Kent Cup, a snooker tournament held in Beijing.“All seven of the world’s top-ranked players came. Willie Thorne, Jimmy White, Steve Davis … At that time, snooker was only played in Zhongshan Park in Beijing. No other places in the city had it, and most people didn’t even know how to play,” Yuan says. “I recall two Chinese players participated, but they clearly had very little idea how to play snooker. It was actually quite funny to watch.”Nowadays, Chinese snooker is no laughing matter. Zhao’s victory on Monday completed his comeback from a 20-month suspension for involvement in a match-fixing ring that has been described as the biggest scandal in snooker’s history. Snooker’s governing body charged 10 Chinese players with match-fixing offences in January 2023 and handed out bans ranging from 20 months to a lifetime. Zhao did not directly throw a match but he accepted charges of being party to another player fixing two games and betting on matches himself.His display of genuine remorse since the scandal was exposed and his rise to the top from being relegated to the amateur tour as part of his punishment has won him legions of fans in China and beyond.“Honestly, at first I didn’t think he’d beat [Mark Williams],” says a snooker fan surnamed Xu who works at KO Snooker Bar in Beijing, referring to the three-time world champion who was Zhao’s opponent in the final. “That shows he’s really put in the work. He’s impressive.”Fans online have been similarly impressed. The hashtag about Zhao’s win was viewed more than 180m times on Weibo.Arriving at Shenzhen Bao’an airport on Thursday, a slightly bewildered Zhao was greeted by hordes of fans thrusting flowers into his arms and reporters thrusting microphones. “Thanks again everyone for your support. I’ll start again and take it slow, and continue to achieve better results in snooker,” Zhao said.Zhao hails from Shenzhen, a city on the border with Hong Kong that is known for having the most developed snooker culture in China, thanks in part to its proximity to the former British colony. In the 1990s, as people flocked to the city during the era of reform and opening up in which China underwent rapid economic development, snooker halls “sprang up like mushrooms after rain”, according to a Shenzhen state media article published this week to celebrate Zhao’s win.Ding Juhui, China’s most successful snooker player before Zhao came on to the scene, moved to Shenzhen at a young age to train owing to the city’s better snooker opportunities, the article said.Since the 1990s, snooker has boomed in popularity across the country, and Zhao’s victory is expected to push it even higher. An estimated 50 million people play the sport and China has 300,000 snooker halls, up from 34,000 in 2005. Chinese eight-ball, a variant on pool, is even more popular.Sun Baochen opened KO Snooker Bar in Beijing’s upmarket Sanlitun district in February. He’s hoping to capitalise on any new Zhao-led boom. Already he spends up to 16 hours a day at the club, which is open around the clock. Business has been “extremely busy”, he says, although on a Tuesday evening there are only about a dozen customers. Zhao’s victory will “definitely” boost the footfall, Sun says. “My whole WeChat Moments feed was talking about it. People were going crazy. It’s something the whole country is proud of.”Yuan beams: “It’s going to create a huge wave of interest. And there are a lot of people in China.”Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu and Lillian Yang",

            "content": "Julia Stiles has been on our screens for almost three decades. After studying theatre in New York as a child, Stiles was cast as a disturbed teenager in the 1998 Michael Steinberg thriller Wicked. This led to her break-out role as the antisocial older sister of Larisa Oleynik and potential girlfriend of bad boy Heath Ledger in the 1999 Shakespeare-influenced 10 Things I Hate About You (based on The Taming of the Shrew). On screen, she then dated Freddie Prinze Jr in Down to You, and swapped ballet for hip-hop with Sean Patrick Thomas in Save the Last Dance.As Stiles grew up, so did her characters. She played a young assistant to Betty Rizzo from Grease (Stockard Channing) in The Business of Strangers. She was Julia Roberts’s student in Mona Lisa Smile and then, most scarily, she played the adopted mother of the son of Satan in the 2006 film The Omen.But it was for her role as black ops CIA agent Nicky Parsons inThe Bourne franchise that Stiles truly went blockbuster. Her on-screen chemistry with Matt Damon’s Jason Bourne is gripping. Bourne holds her at gunpoint in The Bourne Identity, kidnaps her in The Bourne Supremacy, rescues her in The Bourne Ultimatum, and spoiler alert, mourns her in 2016’s Jason Bourne. It’s quite a ride.She also played Ophelia to Ethan Hawke’s Hamlet, Alec Baldwin’s inappropriate love interest in film-within-a-film comedy State and Main, Jason Lee’s homewrecker in the comedy A Guy Thing, and Jennifer Lawrence’s sister in Silver Linings Playbook.On telly, she has appeared in Dexter, hosted Saturday Night Live and has been Punk’d by Ashton Kutcher (supposedly tearing apart an irreplaceable queen’s garment during a photoshoot). She’s also great as the rich, but conniving, American art curator widow in Sky Atlantic series Riviera. She once wrote about being a feminist in the Guardian. And her favourite pizza topping is: not a whole lot.Now she is about to make her directorial debut in romantic drama Wish You Were Here, with Jennifer Grey and Kelsey Grammer, and is here to take your questions. Ask her anything, from being a child star, working with Matt Damon, her lack of pizza toppings, her apparent love for Fleabag and Duran Duran, to – news just in – that the director of 10 Things I Hate About You has announced three new sequels – will Stiles star?Post your questions in the comments by 6pm BST on Monday 12 May and we’ll print her answers in Film & Music on 23 May. Wish You Were Here is available to rent or own from 19 May.",

            "content": "A teetering wall of gungy green bricks greets visitors to this year’s Venice Architecture Biennale, forming an imposing blockade near the start of the show. The blocks are made of bio-cement, incorporating fishing nets and algae dredged from the depths of the Venetian lagoon. The wall’s steeply sloping gradient follows the curve of global population growth over the last millennium, terminating abruptly near the ceiling to represent the coming peak of humanity.\n  “What awaits us on the other side of the hill?” asks Carlo Ratti, director of this year’s biennale, as he stands in front of the momentous cliff. The answer is a great heap of gunge. A festering mountain of mould-like gunk is piled up against the back of the wall, apparently an allegory for microbial intelligence. But it could also be a metaphor for much of the work that follows in the sprawling exhibition hall. “The installation reaches towards an alternative ethics,” an opaque caption tells us. “A trans-scalar, trans-species, collaborative plasticity, that is itself just intelligence.”You might need to bring your scientific dictionary to this year’s exhibition, along with a good deal of patience. Ratti, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he directs something called the Senseable City Lab, has assembled a mind-boggling cast of 750 participants, about 10 times the usual number, many of them academics, convened under the broad umbrella of “Intelligens”. The 300 or so projects are loosely organised around the themes of natural, artificial and collective intelligence, showcasing experiments in everything from 3D-printing with bacteria, to AI-generated floor plans, to the future of space suits. There are lots of robots and lots of trees, and several combinations of both. Don’t fear the climate crisis, the exhibition seeks to reassure visitors: a harmonious union of technology and nature will save us.There’s a lot to please gadget lovers. “Humanoids are here!” Ratti announces excitedly, as we come to an apocalyptic enclosure of charred tree trunks, where a robot clumsily stamps its metal feet while another hits a steel drum. Over the six-month duration of the exhibition, he says, these humanoids will learn various skills, including making the perfect Aperol spritz. Nearby, another robot dangles from the ceiling, convulsing inside a steel cage, which was woven by other robots in a Swiss university. Something resembling a sentient photocopier trundles up, opens a flap, and asks me to scan a QR code. It doesn’t load. Further on, more robots are pitted against humans: two Bhutanese craftsmen patiently carve an intricate decorative beam for a new airport, designed by Bjarke Ingels, next to a much cruder version of the same design, carved by an AI-guided robotic arm. “Robotics doesn’t replace craftsmanship but enhances it,” claims the caption, against all evidence to the contrary.Robotic printers have also been deployed to create numerous globular structures, some that look like termite mounds, others like trees. Dutch architect Winy Maas imagines a “dynamic bio-matter architecture” that cools, filters water, and regenerates, presenting a model inspired by mangrove roots, made of sand, peat and clay. It looks like a set from a sci-fi horror film. Japanese architect Kengo Kuma has used AI to analyse the geometry of fallen trees and generate 3D-printed nodes to join them together. The result is a wayward pile of tree trunks connected with clunky white nodes, far less efficient (or beautiful) than using conventional carpentry techniques. “I hope it’s biodegradable,” says Ratti, fingering the rubbery material, and not seeming to have much of a detailed grasp over the projects on show.It’s hardly surprising. Rather than judiciously select a group of architects or researchers whose work he values, as is usually the role of a curator, Ratti decided to launch an open call. “I wanted to inject a more bottom-up approach into what is usually a top-down process,” he says. “To create a networked super-organism.” It is an admirable ambition, but one that resulted in more than 1,000 submissions, and little sense of quality control. The upside is that it has given some more marginal, occasionally critical, voices a seat at the table. Activist group the Architecture Lobby has produced a compelling display about the working conditions of architects. “Thank you for your unpaid labour,” declares a big sign on the back of their stand, cleverly positioned next to the stage where the directors of high-profile architecture firms will perform in the coming weeks. There’s a makeshift bridge created by protesters to occupy an endangered forest in Germany, and a film about the renovation of public housing in Europe, but it’s hard to sift the wheat from the chaff in the overwhelming melee.With the central pavilion of Venice’s Giardini (one of the two main venues) closed for renovation, the exhibits have been jam-packed into the former rope-making factory of the Arsenale. The result is even more chaotic than usual, like a high school science fair on steroids, each exhibitor trumpeting their novel experiment at full volume. Many are the product of university research departments, “and several Nobel prize winners,” adds Ratti, who aimed to imbue the exhibition with the kind of interdisciplinary, collaborative authorship of academic papers. The tone is very similar to the 2021 biennale, curated by fellow MIT professor, Hashim Sarkis, with equally jargon-filled results. The biennale president, rightwing appointment Pietrangelo Buttafuoco, would do well to cast his net wider, perhaps outside the self-involved walls of academe.The general sense of deja-vu is amplified by the bigger commissions have an oddly retro air. There are the usual self-entitled grandees, teaming up with well-healed sponsors, leading to a quality reminiscent of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, where big egos muscle their way in and insist on the spotlight. On one of the most prominent sites, the Norman Foster Foundation has created a big tubular ramp in collaboration with Porsche, wrapped with a billowing skin of metal scales. It looks like an experiment in parametric design from the early 2000s. The team describes it as “a physical manifestation of the intersection of dreams and reality through inspirations of nature and technology”. The ramp leads to a floating pontoon for a fleet of water bikes, one of Foster’s passions, which you can have a go at splashing around on, next to a floating habitat for endangered crickets.Nearby, 90s design darling Philippe Starck has erected a PVC marquee, housing what looks like a pop-up car showroom for an SUV. “A house for the price of a car,” declares his billboard. Continuing the nostalgic theme, US firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro has revived a proposal they first dreamed up for the 2008 biennale (scuppered by regulatory bureaucracy), to purify Venetian canal water to make espresso. It’s still waiting for public health signoff, but Ratti promises it will soon serve “the best espresso in Venice,” in collaboration with a Michelin-starred chef. Nigel Coates, who also featured in the 2008 edition, is back with one of his whimsical masterplan models made from odds and ends, including bulging phallic towers. But these jokes now feel a bit thin. The world has moved on.Ultimately, the absence of a tight curatorial vision and judicious editing are the biennale’s biggest flaws, along with the sheer scale of the cacophony. If you spent two full days in the main exhibition alone, you would have just 72 seconds to devote to each participant. Add to that the 66 national pavilions, featuring another 400 contributors, and you’re left with about 45 seconds for each. It’s an impossible feat, like trying to complete the internet. And no more enjoyable.Thankfully, a Dutch architecture magazine, Volume, has come up with a canny aid. Their contribution is a witty critique of the biennale format, in the form of an AI-driven app that helps visitors make sense of the ordeal. You can input your interests, choose the personality type of your guide, and it will create a tailor-made itinerary, as well as decode the impenetrable jargon on the wall, “like a Tower of Babel in reverse”. Based on the written content produced for last year’s (smaller) biennale, Volume editor Stephan Petermann says it would take the average reader more than two years to get thought it. Start now, and you might just have a chance to digest this year’s offerings before the next biennale in 2027. Or, as the curators did to generate their caption summaries, you could feed it all into ChatGPT.While the main exhibition might leave you with indigestion, the giardini – the garden that is home to most of the national pavilions – provides a refreshing foil this year, partly because so many of the pavilions are closed. The Czech and Slovak base is shut for renovation, as is the French (they’ve put their exhibition on scaffolding around the building instead). Warmongering has shuttered the Israeli and Russian pavilions although Thomas Heatherwick is hosting an event in the latter, posing the question: “How do we make the outsides of buildings radically more human?” Not bombing them might be a start.Fittingly, given the current level of global destruction, repair and renovation is a recurring theme. The Danish pavilion looks like a bomb has gone off inside, its rooms filled with mounds of rubble, showing the real-time renovation works that architect and curator Søren Pihlmann is carrying out to the 1950s building. Brawny chunks of material salvaged during the refit have been turned into a rugged range of benches and plinths. The Finnish pavilion takes a similar tack, showing films of the meticulous maintenance work carried out to the Alvar Aalto-designed pavilion, highlighting the people involved, as well as the contribution of Aalto’s wives, Aino and Elissa, to his celebrated work, challenging the history of authorship.The US pavilion is a folksy hymn to the country’s love affair with the porch. They have built an angular wooden stoop, by Marlon Blackwell, in front of the neoclassical pavilion, screening the building’s pedimented portico – one in the eye for the Trump administration’s classical beauty mandate. Meanwhile, Japan has fun with AI, assigning the different parts of its pavilion individual personalities, and leaving the language model to generate evermore surreal dialogues, as columns argue with the walls. It reads as a gently mocking critique of the earnest, technocratic uses of AI on show elsewhere. Poland is similarly playful, taking a poetic approach to the sense of security that architecture is supposed to provide, and riffing off Polish traditions of adding features to buildings to protect against ill fortune. Their dazzling niche for a fire extinguisher, tiled with decorative stones and shells, elevates the prosaic piece of safety equipment to something with the status of a household god.Outside the giardini, the Hong Kong contribution is another highlight, celebrating the region’s history of bamboo scaffolding (now under threat after a recent mandate) and spotlighting a number of important postwar buildings, increasingly at risk from demolition. Ukraine’s pavilion takes a poignant look at the country’s vernacular housing, and DIY efforts to rebuild and maintain it against endless Russian aggression. But Estonia’s pavilion packs the most powerful punch of all. Its curatorial trio of young female architects somehow wangled permission to clad the corner of a prominent waterfront palazetto with ferociously ugly white panels, as a searing critique of the country’s programme of wrapping mass housing with clunky exterior insulation. It’s a brilliant one-liner, supplemented by entertaining stories of residents’ struggles inside.And what about us? Once again, the British pavilion suffers from the usual affliction of wanting to be a group art show, combining several disparate commissions under a tenuous theme, this time the Great Rift Valley. Models made from 3D scans of caves in Kenya stand alongside a project about the reconstruction of Gaza, graphite murals inspired by space debris, and a proposal for a Kew Gardens palm house as a “site for generative justice”, clad with tiles of bioplastic and fungi. It’s a confusing muddle, but at least it looks good from outside. The classical building is shrouded with a diaphanous curtain of beads baked from Kenyan earth, as a comment on colonial extraction.Across town, two collateral exhibitions are well worth seeking out. Infographics nerds will rejoice at OMA’s magnificent haul of diagrams on show at the Fondazione Prada, ranging from early Islamic charts of the body to maps of modern warfare. The new San Marco Art Centre, SMAC, is also a treat, with an exhibition on the under-appreciated Australian modernist Harry Seidler and the Korean female landscape architect Jung Youngsun. It’s nice to be reminded of what curatorial clarity looks like.But the most compelling architectural exhibit of all is available outside, for free. Piazza San Marco, symbolic heart of the Venetian empire since the ninth century, is now being dug up, as part of ongoing improvements to the drainage system. Marvel as gigantic slabs of Paduan trachyte are heaved to and fro, their undersides ruggedly hewn from the Euganean hills in the 1700s, and carefully put back on new bedding above the swamp. Now that’s some real intellgens in action.",

            "content": "Pope Leo XIV said he hoped to lead a Roman Catholic church “that illuminates the dark nights of this world” as he held his first mass as pontiff under Michelangelo’s ceiling frescoes in the Sistine Chapel.The surprise election of Robert Francis Prevost, the first US pope, came after a conclave that lasted less than 26 hours, one of the shortest in modern Catholic history.During Friday’s mass with cardinals, Leo began his homily in English, before switching to Italian. In the English passage he quoted words from the psalms, saying: “I will sing a new song to the Lord, because he has done marvels.”“Not just with me,” he continued. “But with all of us, my brother cardinals, as we celebrate this morning, I invite you to recognise the marvels that the Lord has done, the blessings that the Lord continues to pour out upon all of us.”Switching to Italian, he said he hoped the church could “illuminate the dark nights of this world”. He said he would be a “faithful administrator” of the church, and that it should be judged by the holiness of its members and not “the grandeur of her buildings”.In a later passage referring to evangelisation, Leo said there were many settings in which the Christian faith was considered “absurd, meant for the weak and unintelligent. Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure.”He added: “These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied. Yet, precisely for this reason, they are the places where our missionary outreach is desperately needed.”The pope and the 132 cardinals who elected him, from all over the world, will have lunch after the mass. The cardinals will then be free to return home.The Chicago-born Prevost, 69, has been living in Rome since 2023, when Francis appointed him chief of the powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which oversees the selection of new bishops from around the world.He made a surprise visit to the Sant’Uffizio palace, his home until the election, shortly after making his first address to the crowds gathered in St Peter’s Square on Thursday night. The pope stopped in the courtyard to pose for selfies with pilgrims, signing the autograph book of a child and telling them it was the first autograph he had signed as pope, the Italian press reported.St Peter’s Square was markedly less crowded on Friday than on previous days, but there was no shortage of pilgrims processing behind wooden crosses to visit the basilica. Few people were paying attention to the mass, which was broadcast on big screens.Maria Marino, a Catholic from New York, said she was thrilled an American had been chosen to succeed Pope Francis, who died in April at the age of 88. “I’m hopeful that he will reach across all people and bring us together in our faith,” she said.She said Pope Leo XIV had “great respect” for his predecessor and his legacy, “but I think he’ll be his own leader … His spirit seems to be open and listening. I think he’ll be a pope for all people.”Kerry Betts, from Victoria in Australia, said she thought Leo was “impressive and humble. They say he’s a moderate but I hope he doesn’t take the church backwards. I was happy that Pope Francis accepted LGBT people and women, so I’m hoping there’s no radical changes.”The pope has inherited major challenges, ranging from Vatican financial woes and divisions over whether the church should embrace LGBTQ+ Catholics and divorcees, to whether women should play a greater role in the church and tackling the widespread issue of clerical sexual abuse.",

            "content": "Teams will continue to be relegated from the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship beyond 2026, the Guardian can reveal, with the idea of temporarily removing relegation no longer being pursued.The company that runs the top two women’s divisions in England, Women’s Professional Leagues Limited (WPLL), had discussed a four-year pause to relegation to grow both leagues from 2026. That was one of a range of options that clubs and other stakeholders have been consulted on this season.It is understood no decision has been taken about how the formats will change from 2026. The league is believed to be exploring several innovative alterations that could make the top of the women’s pyramid look very different from the English men’s format.WPLL did not wish to comment when approached by the Guardian. In March the WPLL’s chief executive, Nikki Doucet, did not deny that a relegation pause was being explored but said: “We believe promotion and relegation is a great thing. It adds jeopardy and excitement.”The idea was never submitted to the Football Association for ratification. Sources have said there was opposition to a relegation pause among FA figures and at Sky Sports, which broadcasts most live WSL fixtures. On Wednesday, the Football Supporters’ Association published the results of a survey of women’s football fans, which showed that 53.8% of supporters surveyed opposed pausing relegation and 90.2% agreed that “promotion and relegation are a vital part of the integrity of the pyramid”. A large majority (84%) supported expanding the divisions.The FSA’s head of women’s football, Deborah Dilworth, said: “We thank those fans who took the time to provide us with their feedback on these vital issues, and will ensure that the fans’ voice is heard by the game’s decision makers as the consultation process continues. While it’s clear that supporters are in favour of an expanded top two tiers, they’ve been equally clear that it can’t come at the expense of competitive football and the principles of earning your spot at the top of the pyramid.”The WSL was a closed league without relegation when it launched in 2011 as a breakaway league.Sign up to Moving the GoalpostsNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballafter newsletter promotionCurrently one team are relegated to the Championship and one promoted, which this summer will be Crystal Palace and London City Lionesses respectively. At the bottom of the Championship two go down but this season Sheffield United will be the only relegated team after Reading’s withdrawal from the second tier for financial reasons last summer. Coming up from the third tier are Ipswich Town and Nottingham Forest, leading to 12 teams in each of the two top divisions.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 12:00",
            "content": "The looming showdown between the Melbourne-born Scotland captain Sione Tuipulotu and the Wallabies’ prized rugby league recruit Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii was an immediate focus of Australian analysis after the British & Irish Lions squad was announced.The 38 players named by Andy Farrell, led by the England captain, Maro Itoje, and featuring two Australians in Tuipulotu and the winger Mack Hansen, were recognised as clear favourites for the three-match Test series starting in July. But most commentators agreed the improving Wallabies should not fear the Lions, especially if they can stay competitive at the breakdown.The former Wallabies inside-centre Tim Horan, now a broadcaster, backed the call to make Itoje captain. “You’ve got to be first picked in every single Test match for the Lions, so there’s probably about five or six players [would would be], and he’s one of those.”The Sydney Morning Herald rugby columnist Paul Cully said the Lions were “firm favourites” and it was the right call for Farrell to rely on 13 English players alongside 15 from Ireland, the recent standard-bearers in European rugby under the Lions’ head coach.“The earlier prospect of an underwhelming Lions squad was based on the premise that Ireland had plateaued, and while that is arguably still true it did not factor in an England rise,” he said. “But that is what has happened, both late in the Six Nations and through Northampton’s exploits in European club rugby. [Henry] Pollock, Fin Smith, [Tommy] Freeman, and England’s hugely improved scrum work must all be recognised.”The only area of the field where Cully assessed the Wallabies enjoyed an advantage was among loose forwards, “given the presence of the Rob Valetini and the injury-enforced absence of Ireland No 8 Caelan Doris”. The Lions were given the advantage in every other area except midfielders, where the Wallabies Len Ikitau, and Hunter Paisami are tipped to match the tourists.Tuipulotu – who played for Australia Under-20s before switching allegiances to Scotland – will be one of the storylines of the tour, especially given the physical duel between him and Suaalii in a Test in November. Iain Payten noted in the Sydney Morning Herald that Tuipulotu and Hansen became the seventh and eighth Australian-raised players to be selected as Lions, and said “the stage has been set for a feisty rematch” between the naturalised Scotsman and Suaalii.Tuipulotu revealed on the Kick Offs and Kick Ons podcast this week he has been advised to stop publicly discussing Suaalii by the Wallabies analyst Eoin Toolan, whom he knows through working together at the now-defunct Melbourne Rebels. “He’s told me to stop talking on these podcasts about Joey [Suaalii], because he says he’s raring to go. I don’t want to put any targets on my back from big Joey.”Payten also wrote that the omission of Owen Farrell will be warmly received in Australia. “Many Wallabies fans will have been pleased to see no Owen Farrell on the team sheet after a decade of menacing the men in the gold, by means fair and foul,” he said.Sam Bruce writing on ESPN said the absence of Farrell means “there is no fear factor” in the squad. “This is not a vintage Lions group, at least compared with the two most recent touring parties to visit Australia in 2001 and 2013,” he said. “It is a squad to be respected, but certainly one not to be feared.”Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionHarry Jones said on the Roar that it looked as if the squad was selected in the anticipation that the series “will turn on the vagaries of the breakdown more than set piece”. “Grunt and length in the second row must come from his captain, Maro Itoje, and big Scott Cummings; guile and set piece excellence from veteran Leinsterman James Ryan,” he said.Jones posited the squad was chosen with the Wallabies’ strengths and weaknesses in mind. “This team is not selected in a vacuum; Joe Schmidt’s possible moves are preemptively considered, and he is more constrained by depth,” he said.Schmidt said it was a “really strong” Lions squad. “I’d probably say predictable and powerful, good strength in depth,” he said. “I think they’re going to try to play with plenty of pace, plenty of phases and plenty of options.”The Wallabies will name a squad after the Super Rugby Pacific final in late June for a Test against Fiji on 6 July. The squad for the three-Test Lions series will be named the following week.",

            "content": "Advocates for sexual, reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights in Africa are bracing themselves for an influx of some of the most powerful, ultra-conservative campaigners from the US, Poland, Switzerland and the Netherlands over the coming months.The prominent campaigners, who all oppose abortion, transgender and LGBTQ+ rights, and are against sexuality education, are due to speak at a series of conferences focused on African “family values” and “national sovereignty”.Austin Ruse, a former Breitbart columnist and president of the Center for Family and Human Rights (C-Fam); Bettina Roska, a legal officer based in Geneva at the US conservative Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF); and the Dutch founder of Christian Council International, Henk Jan van Schothorst, are among the most notable figures in the global anti-rights movement scheduled to address the Pan-African Conference on Family Values in Nairobi on 12-17 May.Also appearing will be MPs from Uganda and Malawi, Kenyan lawyers and the Africa campaigns director for CitizenGO, Ann Kioko, who calls herself “the most feared” anti-abortion activist in Africa on X.C-Fam and ADF are designated as hate groups by the US monitoring group Southern Poverty Law Center, as is Family Watch International, another backer.Hosted by the Africa Christian Professionals Forum, with a focus on “promoting and protecting the sanctity of life, family values and religious freedom”, the Nairobi event has sent chills through activists and health workers in Kenya and beyond, who fear their work will become much more difficult at a time when the second Trump term has supercharged a “freefall” of rights globally.Nelly Munyasia, director of Reproductive Health Network Kenya (RHNK), says there is nothing African about the agenda being pushed under the guise of family values. “They claim it is African, and yet it’s not African. Africa values are pegged on love and living together as a community.“They are perpetrators of hate,” she says, with their anti-abortion stance “predisposing women to death”.As a result of her advocacy work and efforts to improve access to health information and services, Munyasia has been attacked online and called a “murderer” and a “killer”, accused of “leading young people to hell” by anti-abortion groups.Okwara Masafu, a human rights lawyer at Kenya’s National Gay & Lesbian Human Rights Commission , fears the conference will catapult Kenya’s family protection bill through parliament.The 2023 bill proposes harsh anti-LGBTQ+ laws including life imprisonment for homosexuality, and a number of bans targeted at the LGBTQ+ community including public displays of “amorous relations”, cross-dressing and protests.“This conference is going to solidify the push-through of the family protection bill,” she says. “We can’t overstate the harm it will do.”The Pan-African Conference on Family Values is one of four significant gatherings taking place in Africa over the next four months.This weekend, Uganda will host the third Interparliamentary Forum on Family, Sovereignty and Values. It is reportedly being sponsored, as it was last year, by Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccination advocacy organisation founded by the US secretary of health, Robert F Kennedy Jr.The first Interparliamentary Forum was attended by Sharon Slater, founder of Family Watch International (FWI), another organisation accused of spreading hate and homophobia, and the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, who signed the draconian Anti-Homosexuality Act weeks later in May 2023.According to a CNN investigation, FWI even helped shape the legislation, which is one of the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws with penalties including life in prison or the death penalty in some cases. The group denies that it was involved in lobbying for this law.Kenya’s family protection bill, which aims to outlaw same-sex relationships, LGBTQ+ activities, public cross-dressing and related advocacy campaigns, was submitted by the opposition MP Peter Kaluma shortly after he attended the 2023 conference in Uganda, suggesting that such gatherings not only “stunt and reverse rights but also allow for sharing tactics and resources”, according to Joy Asasira, a reproductive and gender justice campaigner in east Africa.In June, the Mormons, or Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will host a conference entitled Strengthening Families in Sierra Leone’s capital, Freetown, with Mormon leaders taking key roles alongside the country’s first lady, Fatima Maada Bio, and Ivory Coast’s minister of family, women and children, Nasseneba Touré Diané.The presence of the first lady is “worrying”, says Ramatu Bangura, co-chief executive at Purposeful, a hub for girls’ activism in Sierra Leone, because Fatima Bio has, in the past, championed the rights of girls and women.Bangura is concerned that the Strengthening Families conference will affect the passing of a landmark bill that could overturn the country’s British colonial-era abortion ban, legalising a termination at up to 14 weeks for any reason and at any stage under certain conditions.Previous attempts at decriminalising abortion in Sierra Leone have failed because of lobbying from religious and anti-abortion groups.Although Bangura believes Sierra Leone’s president, Julius Maada Bio, supports reproductive rights, she describes the pressure from these groups as “intensive”.“Anti-abortion groups have raised their profile, and are much more adept and astute at their efforts. They’ve seen successes in places like Uganda and Ghana, so they feel emboldened,” says Bangura. She suspects the delay to the bill, which is going through parliament, is due to the conference, which will act as a “rallying point” for the anti-rights movement.Sign up to Global DispatchGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamafter newsletter promotionIn August, Advocates Africa, a network of Christian lawyers and law students, is hosting a conference in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, with backing from ADF.ADF’s application for observer status at the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights in 2023 was rejected, but Saoyo Tabitha Griffith, a Kenyan lawyer and activist at a gender rights organisation, says it was a clear example of western actors trying to increase their influence on the continent, as a means to “weaponise morality and other issues like ‘family’ and ‘African’ values to trigger massive legal reforms”.“This is not just an attempt to infiltrate these bodies to export their hateful agenda; it is also intended to give them more credibility within the African continental context,” says Griffith.These conferences are not new, but observers say the support they are getting from leading figures in the global anti-rights movement is a significant development.“This is the first time in the history of our tracking that we are seeing new faces [at these conferences] such as La Manif pour tous [a French anti-transgender and anti LGBTQ+ group], Ordo luris [a ultra-conservative Polish Catholic group] and Political Network for Values [a global far-right network that rejects abortion and equal marriage] openly advertising themselves as sponsors and speakers at an African conference,” says Griffith.At one point the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was rumoured to be attending the Nairobi conference in a move, activists believe, that was calculated to give credibility and weight to the event.“[These conferences are] an opportunity for back-channel advocacy,” says Sarah Shaw, associate director of advocacy at MSI Reproductive Choices, an organisation that provides safe abortion services around the world.“All it takes is an invitation letter to go out and they can list Rubio as a speaker tbc, and if they are lucky it will get kicked down the chain. It is a tactic, but one that would not have been possible before Trump’s second term. It sends a very clear message to other governments in the region that this is now the mainstream.”All four conferences are framed around family values, protecting religious rights and national sovereignty. “It’s only when you start digging and you look at the narrative surrounding them,” says Shaw. “It’s family, but it’s a very heteronormative version of the family.”Activists across the region are mobilising to counter the idea that African cultural values are under threat, as suggested by the anti-rights movement, and expose it for what it is: an attempt to maintain colonial-era laws that, in Bangura’s words, “were never in the interest of our people in our communities”.Munyasia says: “Debunking their disinformation and providing the right information for everyone is essential.”The Women’s Probono Initiative, a legal and advocacy organisation for women and girls in Uganda, has issued a statement expressing its alarm at the conferences in Uganda and Kenya, and warning that “family protection” policies are a smokescreen for oppressing women.“While we welcome critical discussions around strengthening families … we recognise from prior similar ‘family conferences’’ that what they seek to do is strip women of their basic human rights and dignity and reinforce the dominance of men within our society using family values as a vehicle,” it says.Munyasia’s organisation is among the signatories of a petition criticising the venue for hosting the Pan-African Conference on Family Values. Boma hotel is co-owned by Red Cross Kenya, and is “complicit in enabling this harmful gathering”, it says. The Guardian has approached Red Cross Kenya for comment, but has yet to receive a response.Purposeful has been collaborating with women’s rights activists and organisations across Africa to strategise and learn from one another. On 25 May it will co-publish a report, Until Everybody Is Free, aimed at African feminists and young activists with information on networks, strategies and funding of organised opposition to rights and gender justice on the continent.“We’re ready for a battle; we’re ready to fight, and we understand what the stakes are,” says Bangura. “These forces that are coming into our country from outside are designed to take us back to a colonial era that we’re not interested in going back to.”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/trump-media-tmtg-shares",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 12:00",
            "content": "Large institutional investors have massively increased their holdings of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) in recent months according to SEC filings, with many enlarging their positions by hundreds of millions of dollars.The revelations raise further questions about big business’s desire to curry favor with Donald Trump and his administration via the enterprises he has maintained or commenced. TMTG runs the Truth Social social media platform – on which the US president himself posts almost daily – as well as financial services and a film and TV streaming service.Some of the investing funds have prior connections with Trump and Republican political causes. Among those buying in was Charles Schwab Investment Management (Schwab), founded by the Trump associate Charles Schwab.Critics say that the investments do not reflect any obvious improvement in the business prospects of the company, which lost more than $400m in its 2024 financial results.Tony Carrk is executive director of Accountable.us, a non-profit that monitors the influence of special influence on US politics.In an emailed statement, he told the Guardian, “Donald Trump’s refusal to divest from his publicly traded company has predictably prompted huge investments from wealthy special interests that could use a favor from the president.”He added: “Institutional Wall Street investors and even a foreign company with business before the administration have effectively offered a form of tribute by bulk purchasing shares in DJT on the open market, which helps juice the value of Trump’s own shares.”In both presidential terms, Trump has faced accusations of cronyism and self-dealing. According to the transparency non-profit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, Trump took in about $13.6m in his first term from foreign governments, mostly through payments to his hotels, whose operations he did not sign over to a blind trust as had previous presidents with their business interests.The information in this story was derived from quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings made by major institutions – defined as those managing assets in excess of $100m. The filings reviewed by the Guardian were filed in early February and detail changes in TMTG holdings at 31 December 2024.Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc is a subsidiary of Charles Schwab corporation, which is regularly listed as being among the 20 largest banks in the United States.In the final quarter of 2024 the company bumped up its TMTG stake by almost a third, finishing the year with 788,722 shares worth $19.7m.According to Schwab, this is in line with their normal investment strategy.In an emailed statement, a spokesperson wrote: “As a large asset manager with nearly $400bn in ETF [exchange-traded funds] assets under management, our position in any publicly traded company is driven by our index funds and ETFs that track an underlying index. The extent a position changes is due to the change in the index itself or client flows into the ETF and is not reflective of any view of a company.”As Trump told a group of Nascar drivers in introducing that company’s founder at an Oval Office meeting on 11 April, Charles Schwab is “not just a company, it’s actually an individual”.Charles R Schwab, 88, made billions by offering lower costs on share trading for retail investors and pioneering innovations like ETFs. He has been a prolific Republican donor, including to a Republican National Committee legal fund that has helped fund Trump’s many legal battles since 2017. He suspended his Pac following the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol, citing a “hyperpartisan” political climate.But he has remained in Trump’s orbit, as evidenced by the 11 April meeting in the Oval Office.That day Trump told the group of Schwab, “he made two and half billion today”, the same day that markets rallied after Trump partly suspended his so-called Liberation Day tariffs announced 2 April.Earlier that day, on his Truth Social account, Trump infamously posted ““THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT”, with the post and Schwab’s presence both igniting accusations of market manipulation and “insider trading”.Schwab has business and personal connections with Trump businesses and the administration.When the TMTG CEO, Devin Nunes – a former congressman and first-term Trump ultra-loyalist – announced in January that TMTG would push into financial services and cryptocurrency investments with the Truth.fi initiative, it was also announced that Schwab’s brokerage would “custody the assets and ‘broadly advise’ on Truth.Fi’s investment plans” according to Financial Times reporting.Earlier that month, Samantha Schwab, Charles Schwab’s granddaughter, was appointed deputy chief of staff at the treasury department. Schwab senior donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural committee.But Schwab’s company was not the only one that substantially increased its investment in TMTG stock.Foreign billionaires with Trumpist sympathies have also piled into the stock.Hancock Prospecting, an Australian mining company owned by Gina Rinehart, was a new shareholder in the fourth quarter, picking up 150,000 shares for some $3.7m.Trump backers in the US have described Rinehart as a “female Donald Trump”, and Rinehart has characterized herself as a “Trumpette” – a member of a female Trump fan club – and attended his campaign launch at Mar-a-Lago in 2024, while urging Australia’s political leaders to “Make Australia Great Again”, and telling investors this year that “We need a USA-style Doge that delivers action, one that helps to return dollars to our pockets and investment back to Australia.”She has appeared at several US events with Trump, and took out full page advertisements in US newspapers to congratulate him on his victory last year. She has urged Trump-like policies on Australia’s politician Peter Dutton, who recently lost to the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, in Australia’s elections.The Guardian contacted Charles Schwab Investment Management and Hancock Prospecting for comment on this reporting.TMTG has been hit by numerous scandals, especially since it went public in 2021.Last year, two men pleaded guilty to securities fraud over insider trading in shares of the company that eventually merged with Trump’s fledgling media company to take it public.The company has also sought to punish those shorting the stock – betting that it will decline in value – by reporting such activities to the SEC as suspicious.It remains to be seen if new initiatives in financial services – to be offered alongside the core social media business and a streaming app featuring mostly pro-Maga commentary – will finally put the company in the black.The company is yet to post a profit; the most recent earnings report showed a loss of $19.2m in the third quarter of 2024, with falling sales and income.Carrk, the Accountable.us director, said: “Considering Trump Media has been hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, there’s little doubt these hedge fund managers are hoping for a different kind of return on their investment.”He added: “The President might as well put up a ‘bribe me’ sign on the White House – it’s corruption out in broad daylight.”",

            "title": "Energy bills: EDF offers fixed deal £300 cheaper than price cap",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/may/09/energy-bill-edf-fixed-deal-300-price-cap-gas-electricity",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 12:00",
            "content": "Households in Great Britain have been grappling with high energy bills for four years but attractive fixed deals that are £300 cheaper than the current price cap are now available.This week, EDF launched its “cheapest fixed tariff since 2021”, describing it as the best energy-only deal available from a “big six” supplier. The 12-month tariff, Simply Fixed Direct May26, is priced at £1,549 for an average dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit. This is £300 below the regulator Ofgem’s latest price cap.The deal highlights the “great energy bill savings households can nab if they switch” to a fix, according to Will Owen, an energy expert at the price comparison website Uswitch.Energy watchers may be worried about locking in to a fix given the uncertain economic picture but, based on its own projections, EDF expects the deal to remain competitive over the next year. It predicts the fix, which is only available until 11.59pm on Sunday, will be at least £154 cheaper than the July price cap, and £143 cheaper over winter. There is also peace of mind in that customers who sign up directly with EDF can switch away again with no exit fee.Rich Hughes, the EDF director of retail, said: “While wholesale costs have dropped, the market remains unstable and global factors could push prices up again. Given the volatility, we advise households to consider fixed or tracker tariffs.”Ofgem sets a price cap on household energy bills every quarter by using a formula that tracks wholesale energy prices, as well as providers’ network costs. Since April the cap, which reflects the typical bill for about 29 million households, has been £1,849.Energy experts at Cornwall Insight, a leading forecaster, predict the cap will drop by 9%, or £166, from July to £1,683. This is still one-third higher than before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a global gas crisis and rocketing market prices. If that happens, EDF’s deal will still be less than you would pay on a standard variable tariff.In recent weeks, gas market prices have fallen on the back of the economic fears linked to the US trade war and the warmer than average start to spring, which has reduced overall demand for heating. Cornwall’s experts expect a “very slight fall” in the price cap in October, followed by another drop in January 2026.Owen said large suppliers had been vying for customers in recent weeks. “At £300 cheaper than the April price cap for the average household, it stands out as the cheapest fixed deal on the market from a larger provider,” he added.However, the fixed is the not the cheapest if smaller suppliers are included. Then the lowest-cost is Outfox the Market at £332 below the price cap. The 12-month tariff is called Fix’d Dual May25 12M v5.0 and costs £1,517 for typical usage.After a period when competition on energy deals has been lacking, it is once again worth shopping around. “The price cap is predicted to fall in July to £1,683, but there are 16 fixed deals available now that are already below this forecast level,” said Owen.“If you haven’t switched in a year or more, you are probably on a standard deal and your rates are effectively dictated by the price cap,” he continued. “Energy prices continue to be volatile. If you find a deal which beats the current cap and the July prediction, then switching is a no-brainer. It only takes a few minutes to run a comparison, so it’s worth checking what deals are available to you.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 12:00",
            "content": "Israel’s announcement of a new offensive to “conquer” Gaza, along with claims by Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli minister of finance, that the strip will be “entirely destroyed”, have flustered the international community. Observers may be distressed, disturbed or upset by these plans. But they should come as no surprise. This kind of genocidal ideology has been evident, in Smotrich’s case, since long before 7 October. And opposition voices – including mine – have been warning of the government’s intentions in Gaza since October 2023.These latest actions by the fanatic nationalists in Israel’s government are causing misery to Palestinians, but also to Israelis. The decision of the Israeli cabinet to expand its invasion has terrified the families of Israeli hostages. They have accused Smotrich of promoting his messianic vision on the graves of their loved ones, and Benjamin Netanyahu of hiding information and lying to them about the number of living hostages. Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan, who was kidnapped from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October, went to the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) this week with a chilling warning: the expansion of military efforts in Gaza will lead to the death of hostages, she said. When she called on army reservists to refuse drafting orders, she was silenced and removed from the platform.In October 2023, in my first interview after the massacre of 7 October, I warned that the Israeli government would utilise the brutal slaughter in order to pursue its plans to annex Palestinian territories. The plan I referred to was one formulated by Smotrich in 2017, titled the Subjugation Plan (sometimes translated as the Decisive Plan). In it, he laid out a blueprint to eradicate the prospect of a Palestinian state. In a harrowing document that discusses people as if they were pawns on a chessboard, Smotrich reshaped the borders of Israel. First, he demanded annexation of Palestinian territory without granting basic political, civil or national rights to Palestinians, treating them instead as colonial subjects. Second, those Palestinians who would not accept their lot as second-class subjects would be physically expelled from their homes, lands and their homeland altogether. And third: those who resist, who struggle for their fundamental rights as human beings, would be hunted and killed.While at the time of its publication this plan was directed mostly towards the occupied West Bank, it is clear how today the fog of war will allow for its implementation in Gaza. I was not a prophet sent to forewarn and predict the cynical ploy of Netanyahu and his gang of settlers – I only needed to listen to what they were saying. I was subsequently suspended from my position in the Knesset, and I am now serving a second suspension for endorsing South Africa’s request to the international court of justice to bring accountability and justice in the face of the violence I warned of.How can one be surprised by the comments of Smotrich if the actions of the Israeli cabinet for the past 18 months have followed his subjugation plan? Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank have been bombed, starved, slaughtered and expelled in order to make room for Smotrich’s vision of new settlements. While the people of the world observed the war with terror and fear, Smotrich’s settlers boasted that they were living in a “miraculous time”.In the ongoing disputation as to what extent the actions of Israel constitute the crime of genocide, this plan should serve as the prime exhibit for the prosecution. “Subjugation” for Smotrich and his gang translates to ethnic cleansing, forceful transfer, illegal annexation and killings that break international law. In essence, this plan aims for the complete destruction and dissolution of the Palestinians as a national community, as a shared people, in their own homeland – isn’t this the definition of genocide?“Any attempt to annex land in Gaza would be unacceptable” said the UK’s Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, this week. His words, which came with no sanctions or consequences attached, dispersed into thin air. It seems truly farcical that almost 20 months into this calamity there are still those who believe the Israeli government could be persuaded to change course by words alone, or that the Israeli cabinet holds any degree of care for rule of law and international norms. But if I first felt some degree of pity towards the UK government and its ineffectual diplomacy, it quickly turned into a burning anger when I remembered the recent visit of the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, to the UK. Only weeks ago he received protection from the same government that now accuses his cabinet of unacceptable and unlawful conduct of war.For the sake of the Palestinians, the hostages and the people of Israel, the Israeli government must be held to account. This cannot be accomplished through words alone.

            "content": "Good morning.Robert Francis Prevost, the first US cleric to lead the Roman Catholic church, has said “evil will not prevail” as he addressed a crowd of 100,000 pilgrims and tourists in his first speech as Pope Leo XIV from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica.The election on Thursday of Prevost, 69, as the church’s 267th pontiff ended the Vatican’s longstanding opposition to the idea of a pope from the US.Why choose the name Leo? That Prevost has decided to become Leo XIV will make Catholics think of the previous Leo – Leo XIII – and his 1891 encyclical or teaching document, Rerum Novarum, which outlined workers’ rights to a fair wage, safe working conditions and the rights of workers to belong to trade unions.What does it mean for LGBTQ+ Catholics? After years of sympathetic and inclusive comments from Pope Francis, LGBTQ+ Catholics expressed concern on Thursday about hostile remarks Pope Leo XIV made more than a decade ago in which he condemned “the homosexual lifestyle” and “redefinition of marriage” as “at odds with the gospel”.Donald Trump has announced he is nominating Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host and former state-level prosecutor, as the interim US attorney for the District of Columbia.The president made the selection after he was forced to withdraw the nomination of Ed Martin, who has been serving in the post since Trump returned to office as he appeared unlikely to be permanently confirmed by the Senate.Who said they wouldn’t back Martin? Thom Tillis, the Republican North Carolina senator, said he would not support his nomination – and Martin also lacked allies at the justice department.Why was he unpopular? He was seen as too aggressive with his threats to prosecute Trump’s political adversaries, including Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. Republican senators were concerned about the risk of a Democratic appointee to act similarly in the future.Where does Pirro stand? She is a diehard Trump ally whose false claim that the 2020 election was rigged by Dominion Voting Systems was used against Fox in court. Fox settled in the defamation case and acknowledged her statements were false.JD Vance has said the US will not intervene in the conflict between Pakistan and India, calling fighting between the two nuclear powers “fundamentally none of our business”.The remarks came during an interview with Fox News, where the US vice-president said the US would seek to de-escalate the conflict but could force neither side to “lay down their arms”.What did Vance say? “What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of a war that’s fundamentally none of our business … Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict. Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen.”Chinese exports to the US fell by 17.6% in April, even as its overall exports exceeded forecasts, rising by 8.1% annually, official figures show.The Pentagon is firing the 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as trans, and has told other trans troops who do not openly identify to stand down within 30 days.Vladimir Putin has received Xi Jinping and other world leaders as Russia marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Moscow, while several European foreign ministers instead visited Ukraine.Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, who made an enemy of Trump after he was ordered to pay more than $450m in penalties after a lawsuit brought by her office.Liberia is home to more than half of west Africa’s forests – but they are under threat from logging as the world “retreats from international commitments and cooperation”, warns Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the country’s 24th president. She explains how after the devastating civil war, 60% of the land had been allocated in logging concessions, before her government enacted a moratorium and changed the process. Here’s why she fears things are going backwards.Eighty years after the end of the second world war, two former Berlin correspondents examine how the Guardian covered the Nazis. In this podcast, Helen Pidd and Philip Oltermann discuss Frederick Augustus Voigt, the Manchester Guardian’s Berlin correspondent in 1920-32, and his incredible reporting on the rise of Nazi Germany that led to a Gestapo plot to murder him.In the latest example of Trump’s slashing of resources to understand and deal with the climate crisis, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) will no longer track the cost of weather disasters driven by the planetary emergency. Since 1980, it has been tracking information on the impact of events including floods, heatwaves, wildfires.After a difficult relationship breakup, rambling 700 miles from the Highlands to Dorset with a donkey called Martin helped restore Adam Lee’s faith in people. But it was no walk in the park. “Very quickly, I realised that walking a donkey around suburban streets does not in any way prepare you for walking across the west Highlands,” he said. “Once, I attempted to take Martin across a bog but he wasn’t having any of it.”First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

            "content": "More by happenstance than planning, perhaps, the Met Gala, which took place in New York on Monday night, struck a note that seemed stridently to oppose Donald Trump. The theme of the evening, devised to advertise the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, Superfine: Tailoring Black Style, was Black dandyism – an apparently defiant push back against Trump’s executive order removing initiatives to promote, “so called ‘under-represented groups’”. Even if the theme had been planned before Trump’s re-election, it was surely great to see.It was also a rare example of politics coinciding with the $75,000-a-head fundraiser in a way that wasn’t completely gauche. The memory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez using the Met Gala to advertise the slogan “Tax the Rich” – and in the process comprehensively lose control of her message – probably contributed to Kamala Harris’s decision on Monday to slip in through a side door rather than risk the red carpet. (Harris was dressed in a black and white silk gown by Ib Kamara, while Doug Emhoff, her husband, wore a tux by Brunello Cucinelli).Other stand outs of the evening: Colman Domingo’s fabulous floor length cape by Valentino; Madonna’s white suit and cigar (her first time at the Met Gala in seven years and the 66-year-old’s still got it); and Janelle Monáe and Whoopi Goldberg splendid in Thom Browne. Meanwhile Anna Wintour, the organiser and host, enjoyed what appears to be her annual public outing without sunglasses while flamboyantly performing her 2020 resolution – made in the face of accusations of racial insensitivity at Vogue – that she is “committed to doing the work”.I say this with love (not really): what’s up with Steve Carell’s gnashers? The actor appears in Tina Fey and Tracey Wigfield’s new eight part Netflix comedy, The Four Seasons, in which three couples spend a year going on holiday with each other to talk about the health of their marriages and nothing else.The show is long, boring and apparently devised by people who haven’t had even the most glancing interaction with the world everyone else inhabits for a very long time – but it’s still Tina Fey, which means that roughly every seven minutes there’s a throwaway line that is funnier than anything you’ll find in a much better show.Meanwhile the real star of the show is Carell’s amazing veneers, which, like the old Victoria Wood joke about Deirdre Barlow’s perm getting shorter and tighter with each episode of Coronation Street (“Come home, Ken, it’s up to me glasses!”) seem to get more prominent with each public appearance. They draw one’s attention to Carell’s mouth in a way, at this point in the 62-year-old actor’s career, that is deserving of their own credit.Barry Diller, the businessman and media mogul who has been married to Diane von Fürstenburg for 24 years, makes the brave decision at the age of 83 to come out as what his generation would call an “openly gay man”. It’s a reveal he has chosen to make in his forthcoming memoir, Who Knew, in which he writes about the suffering he went through while hiding his sexuality for fear that it would stunt “any chance of my having a fulfilling personal life”, a sense of powerlessness that often overwhelmed him. (Diller’s been a billionaire since the 1990s).Who knows what Diller’s deal with Von Fürstenburg really is, but I can tell you that sublimating his sexuality for the social capital of being “normal” isn’t something a lot of gays, including this one, are particularly fond of, although of course everyone is on their own unique journey etc. You see it a lot in born again lesbians who have their kids with men for reasons of social and financial expediency, then pop out the other side wanting a medal, and in men who make the brave decision to acknowledge the truth about their lives, supportive wives rictus-faced by their sides. At least Diller, in excerpts from the book, seems to acknowledge that aspects of his conduct over the years have constituted the “opposite of courage”, so well done, OK, whatever.Speaking of fancy gents: conclave! You go for years without saying the word “conclave” and then it’s the only word you use for a solid two weeks. Politico reports that before the election of a new pope on Thursday, some of the 133 cardinals participating in the conclave – many for the first time – sneaked a look at the 2024 movie starring Ralph Fiennes as an ambitious cardinal running a conclave, as a primer on how the process might go.Meanwhile, the elevation of the cardinal Robert Francis Prevost as the first pope from the US throws up certain delicious possibilities. Pope Leo XIV, as he will be known, made his address on Thursday in Spanish and what Channel 4 news called “American-accented” Italian – bit rude, but anyway, notably no English. Still, American he is, from the South Side of Chicago, prompting the New York Times to ask the vital question – White Sox or Chicago Cubs? – and the Free Press to speculate, happily, that we now live in a world in which the pope “might have a Costco membership”.The news that Brits apparently apologise up to nine times a day is, sorry, a classic example of under-reporting. The findings, from a survey by Interflora, found that 90% of the 2,000 respondents admitted to routinely apologising for things that weren’t their fault, resulting in an annual apology-count of 3,285 a year. Triggers included squeezing past someone in a queue, summoning help at the self-checkout, and sneezing, which is all well and good but overlooks the standard preface made by any British person embarking on a statement, “Um, sorry”, or the hair trigger need to panic apologise to inanimate objects you may have bumped into.",

            "content": "Robert Francis Prevost, chosen as the new leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics and who has taken the papal name Leo XIV, is not widely known despite a long missionary career and senior roles in the Vatican. Here are five things about him.Although 10 of the 133 cardinal-electors at this week’s conclave were American, there had long been reticence about the notion of a US pontiff. Much of the opposition sprang from worries over how having a leader from a political, cultural and secular superpower could be interpreted. But that taboo was broken on Thursday evening.After making his solemn vows in 1981 and studying in Rome, Prevost was sent to a mission in Peru. He spent more than 20 years there, serving as judicial vicar and as a professor of canon, patristic and moral law at a seminary in Peru’s third city, Trujillo, before being appointed bishop of Chiclayo in November 2014. The 69-year-old has Peruvian citizenship and is widely admired in South America’s third-largest country, hence all the Inca Kola and ceviche memes that greeted his appointment.The conclave had been billed as a clash between progressives, who wished to carry on the Francis’s legacy, and conservatives, who wanted to return the church to a more traditionalist path. The new pontiff, however, is seen as a moderate figure and his time in Peru was marked by a talent for working with different theological factions. In an interview with the New York Times, his brother John Prevost described him as “middle of the road”, adding: “I don’t think we’ll see extremes either way.”Prevost entered the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine in 1977, serving as prior general, or leader, from 2001 until 2013. The order, founded in Italy in 1244, is dedicated to poverty, service and spreading the word of God. Among its core values is a commitment to “live together in harmony, being of one mind and one heart on the way to God”. He is the first Augustinian friar to be elected pope.The new pontiff, made a cardinal by the late Pope Francis in September 2023, had been president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and had served as prefect of the powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which oversees the selection of new bishops from around the world.",

            "content": "The dynamic between audience and performer is vital to theatre, so what happens when it is imperilled? Einkvan (Everyman), written by the Nobel-winning novelist and playwright Jon Fosse and directed by Kjersti Horn, puts that idea to the test, hiding the entire stage behind fogged plastic curtains suggestive of a sinister clinic. The six-person cast register only as vaguely shifting shapes, though their faces are filmed in tight closeup by two cameras; the images are then relayed to the auditorium on a pair of screens above the stage and accompanied by the cryptic Norwegian dialogue in surtitles. The effect is contradictory. We are so intimate with these actors that we can count every pore on their faces and even see the ring-lights reflected in their eyes, but we are also simultaneously held at arm’s length.That discord mirrors the play’s themes of estrangement and solitude, the need for human contact locked in a violent struggle with the thirst for autonomy. The opening closeups form a diptych of the same face shot from different angles as a man lies in the bath fretting over the possibility that someone is watching or following him. Someone other than the camera operator, presumably.He doesn’t have both screens to himself for long. Soon, a second male face appears on the right. Are they old flames? Siblings? Or, given the Bergmanesque mood, two halves of the same personality? The possibilities shift as readily as the camera angles. Other pairs of doppelgangers take their turn in closeup, each making some parental claim on the younger duo. The bathwater becomes redolent less of a soak in the tub than the suspension of a foetus in amniotic fluid. Never mind cutting the apron strings: the son seems barely to have departed the womb.Among this opaque production’s more expressive elements is Oscar Udbye’s lighting, which allows the pale antiseptic chill to give way now and then to a warming orange glow that defrosts the stage before the next emotional ice age sets in. In Erik Hedin’s score, a piano motif surfaces from the eerie ambient hum before plunging, like the son in his bathtub, back beneath the surface again. At the Coronet theatre, London, until 17 May",

            "content": "A recent dinner was peaceable until it was just about over, when a friend’s son spoke up in praise of a middle-of-the-road columnist and how his opposition to Donald Trump’s attack on democracy revealed that we were all on the progressive left now.“Not true,” I responded with more vehemence than I expected. “Wanting democratic norms is not sufficient; it is merely a precondition for meaningful change.” Making sure the US’s plumbing was secure did not mean that anything of importance would pass through the pipes.There has been a great outcry about the erosion of democratic practices during these first hundred days of the second Trump presidency. Many Americans, probably a solid majority, are appalled at the attack on our courts and judges, at the willful ignoring of habeas corpus, at the intrusion of unelected figures – not just Elon Musk, but his whole “department of government efficiency” (Doge) team – into the privacy of American lives, at the undoing of the independence of agencies intended to protect the public.But protecting democracy is not enough. It is a rearguard action, one that fights against incursions that would transform the United States into an oligarchic state serving special interests. It does not address the needs of the larger public. Fighting for procedures and not substance is insufficient.Those who fight for the future of our nation need to fight not just against threats, but for a just and equitable future. Too often the well-deserved plaudits for those who fight against do not extend to articulating a program of what the American nation needs, in addition to democratic institutions.Here are five specific suggestions for what we should be fighting for. Without these reforms, defenses of democracy ring hollow, elevating a defense of form while denying any attention to substance.First, the nation needs a new minimum wage, a living wage, not the residue of 1938 legislation called the Fair Labor Standards Act. No one can live on $7.25 an hour, which translates to about $15,000 a year.Second, Americans deserve healthcare as a right. A Medicare for All system would extend healthcare to every person. Its cost would be more than offset by eliminating the 25% of healthcare spending that goes for overhead in our private-insurance-dominated system. Cutting $1tn of needless bureaucratic expenses and bill-keeping would ensure that we have the money to provide healthcare to everyone.Third, Americans should find it easy to join unions if they wish. The decline in unionization is a major reason why, as the wealthy get ever wealthier, wages have been flat or declining for almost 50 years. As it stands, the table is tilted toward management. Corporations regulate all employee concerns, from wages to healthcare to retirement benefits, leaving workers little to no chance to say what they actually want. We must level that playing field so that workers together can fight for their needs.Fourth, we need to increase taxes on the wealthy. There is no reason that Warren Buffett, as he has said, should pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. Increasing the marginal tax rate for the highest earners, limiting the exorbitant pass-throughs of the inheritance tax, and ending the unhealthy practice of taxing paper gains in wealth, or capital gains, less than the money earned by workers would diminish the federal deficit and at the same time fund many needed services to Americans. Removing the cap on income subject to social security taxes would ensure the solvency of the nation’s pension program for generations.Fifth, we should reverse the deeply damaging Citizens United decision, which enabled the wealthy and their special interests to buy elections. Currently, money and not votes determines the priorities of the United States. If the supreme court does not reverse this decision, a constitutional amendment limiting contributions – one person, one vote, with a low limit on individual contributions and no contributions by corporations – would fix this loophole, which has corrupted all of American politics.Sign up to Fighting BackBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency. From our opinion desk.after newsletter promotionThere is, rightly, much concern about the undemocratic moves made by the Trump administration. But unless we demand changes in what the United States does, unless we do more than just defending the practices of democracy, our society will remain dysfunctional. Those who focus only on the process of maintaining the pipes required for quenching our thirst, without giving us actual water to drink, are fighting only a small part of the battle.We need to fight for democracy, but we also need to fight for the achievable goals democracy can bring us, particularly economic justice for all Americans. Raising wages, providing healthcare to all, fostering unions, taxing the wealthy and corporations, preventing big money from buying elections: these are the things the renewal of democracy can and should bring us.Huck Gutman is a former chief of staff to Senator Bernie Sanders and an emeritus professor at the University of Vermont",

This week’s column is very much the product of both, but I’ve been encouraged to write it by having near-identical requests from friends arrive at the same time of year, two years running: each was planning an important celebration in their garden (a wedding and a naming ceremony) in late summer, and wanted them to be in full bloom for the occasion.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link. Learn more.As a royal parks gardener once said to me: “If it could be May for ever, I’d be happy.” It’s a glorious month: everything is soft, fresh and dewy.

The thud and the inevitable horticultural failures of midsummer, the dry ground and drying lawns, are on the distant horizon. Lovely May.The anxiety-inducing planner in me wants to heartily encourage you to pause this reverie to imagine August or September. You stopped watering regularly a few weeks ago, when you went on holiday. The slugs returned during that miserable grey bit in July. But more than this: your garden looked heavenly in May, and so you considered your job done and didn’t want to believe there were four months of good garden time ahead. Now all the flowers have gone over. It is somewhat depressing.But it doesn’t have to be.

I love that last-chance-saloon feeling that arrives with the autumn equinox; I love adding plants that catch September’s spiderwebs and sticky sunsets.Here are some guaranteed bangers: Japanese anemone; Agastache; Achillea; Hylotelephium (or sedums); Salvia (they’ll keep blooming into November); Altheas, I have the smaller, more ditsy A. cannabina and its half-sisters, what I think of as the posh hock, Alcalthaea suffrutescens ‘Parkfrieden’ and ‘Parkallee’, in both the gravel bed, where they romp away, and the shadier beds. Persicaria are reliable doers in beds throughout the summer, their elegant foliage politely filling in gaps, but P. amplexicaulis shoots out long floral spears in deep pinks and reds, or white (‘Alba’).These are my favourites, but I want to impress the need to find some of your own. By now you’ll have the makings of a colour palette, and an awareness of where the gaps in your beds are; it’s not too late to plonk some 9cm pots in and make your future self grateful.",

            "content": "When I first saw the Harvard report on antisemitism and anti-Israel bias, I didn’t expect to find myself in it. But I did, albeit without my name, my scholarship, or even my identity as a Jewish Israeli academic being acknowledged.The report was compiled and published in response to widespread pressure from donors and pro-Israel advocacy groups. It claims to document a crisis of antisemitism on campus. But what it actually reveals is Harvard’s willingness to redefine Jewish identity in narrow, ideological terms: to exclude and erase Jews who dissent from Zionism.I know this because I am one of them. For several years, I taught in the Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative (RCPI) at Harvard Divinity School. Our program approached peacebuilding through deep engagement with histories of structural violence and power, with Palestine/Israel as our central case study. Our students read widely, traveled to the region, and met with a range of voices – including Jewish Israeli veterans from Breaking the Silence, Palestinian artists resisting cultural erasure, and Mizrahi and Ethiopian Jewish activists challenging racism within Israeli society.It was, by design, intellectually and politically challenging. It exposed students to the complexity of the region and the diverse, often conflicting, ways Jews and Palestinians narrate their pasts and imagine their futures.But according to the authors of Harvard’s report, this was not legitimate scholarship nor responsible pedagogy; it was, essentially, simply antisemitic ideological indoctrination.How the report supposedly arrives at and justifies such characterizations of our program illustrates how slanderous distortions are routinely deployed to suppress the arguments and identities of ‘the wrong kind’ of Jews. The report quotes from public events we hosted as part of RCPI, including a webinar on my book about American Jewish activists who engage in Palestinian solidarity work because of—not in spite of—their Jewish identity. Rabbi Brant Rosen, a Reconstructionist rabbi and founder of Tzedek Chicago, and Dr Sara Roy, a distinguished scholar of Palestine and daughter of Holocaust survivors, offered thoughtful responses.Yet the report reduced that event to a vague description of “one speaker” praising “Jewish pro-Palestinian activists,” ignoring that the speaker was me—a Jewish Israeli professor—and that my interlocutors were also Jewish. Rosen’s reflections on his disillusionment with Zionism were dismissed as a “conversion narrative,” as if spiritual or ethical evolution were evidence of antisemitism.In another webinar I moderated, Rosen and the Jewish scholar Daniel Boyarin debated the place of Zionism in synagogue liturgy. Boyarin disagreed with Rosen’s liturgical revisions but affirmed their shared ethical commitments. The report cherry-picked Boyarin’s comment—“I am deeply in sympathy with your political and ethical positions”—to suggest the event lacked “viewpoint diversity.” The irony is hard to miss: a conversation between three Jews, from very different traditions, becomes evidence not of diversity, but of its absence.This selective framing is neither accidental nor a one-off act of malice. It reflects a broader pattern: Harvard’s decision in January of this year to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which conflates criticism of Israeli policies with antisemitism itself. In doing so, the university has not only taken steps to further suppress important political and ethical speech that confronts the reality of Israeli violence against Palestinians; it also effectively embraced a political litmus test for who counts as a legitimate Jew on campus.It’s clear that I’m the ‘wrong kind of Jew’ at Harvard. At each juncture, my academic and political commitments placed me outside the bounds of acceptability. I was too critical, too engaged, too willing to challenge dominant narratives. And I am far from the only one.The report goes further still. It dismisses not only the work, identities, and experiences of faculty and scholars but also the experiences of our Jewish students, including those who participated in our course’s study trip to Palestine/Israel. One Jewish student described the experience as “formative, painful, and powerful,” recounting the ways Israeli apartheid undermines not just politics but the very possibility of cultural life for Palestinians. The report presents this reflection not as evidence of learning, but as proof of indoctrination.The implication is clear: Jewish students who come to critical conclusions about Israel are not independent thinkers. They’ve been misled. Manipulated. Infantilized.Ironically, this is itself an antisemitic trope: that Jews cannot think for themselves unless they conform to a sanctioned ideology.The report also erases the rich diversity of Jewish voices we brought into our classrooms. It claims our program focused on “non-mainstream Jewish perspectives,” dismissing people like Noam Shuster Eliassi, a Mizrahi Jewish Israeli comedian whose work was supported by our fellowship program and is now featured at the Sundance Film Festival. It ignores events that engaged deeply with Mizrahi and Ethiopian Jewish experiences, including our commemoration of the Israeli Black Panthers’ Passover Haggadah—a powerful symbol of anti-racist struggle in Israeli history.And it entirely omits our programming on antisemitism itself, including a discussion of alternative definitions of antisemitism like the Jerusalem Declaration, which, unlike IHRA, carefully distinguishes between criticism of Israel and hatred of Jews.In short, Harvard’s report does not just mischaracterize a program. It attempts to redraw the boundaries of Jewish legitimacy.It sends a chilling message to students and faculty: if you are a Jew who questions Zionism, you are suspect. If you engage in solidarity with Palestinians, you do not belong. If your scholarship complicates the tidy moral narrative of a beleaguered Israel, you are not just unwelcome—you are dangerous.This is not a defense of Jewish safety. It is an effort to police Jewish dissent.But I refuse to be policed. I will continue to teach, write, and organize alongside Jews and Palestinians fighting for freedom, justice, and dignity. I will continue to challenge institutions that claim to defend against antisemitism while perpetuating other forms of racism and repression.And I will do so not despite being a Jew, but because I am one.Atalia Omer is professor of religion, conflict, and peace studies in the Keough School of Global Affairs at the University of Notre Dame.

            "content": "A stalker who broke into Eminem’s home in Michigan for a second time has been convicted of first-degree home invasion and aggravated stalking.Matthew David Hughes was arrested in August 2024 after being seen at the rapper’s home in Clinton Township, a suburb in north-eastern Detroit. He didn’t meet bail conditions and has been jailed since his arrest.Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, testified at the court hearing on Wednesday. A jury found Hughes guilty of both charges. He will be sentenced on 17 June.The 32-year-old had previously been charged with home invasion in 2020, when he entered Eminem’s Clinton Township property while the rapper was at home. Eminem said that he woke up to find Hughes standing behind him; a police officer recounted that Eminem “was told by Mr Hughes that he was there to kill him”.Following a plea deal, Hughes avoided prison and was sentenced to five years’ probation in September 2021. But he violated the terms of probation with an unrelated assault later that year and was sentenced to a prison term. He was released on parole in May 2024.In 2019, Hughes broke into one of Eminem’s former homes in the Rochester Hills area of Detroit. He initially spoke with the new homeowner, telling them he was “looking for his brother Marshall”, then later broke into a guest house on the property. He served a 90-day prison term after being convicted of breaking and entering.The case has resonances with one of Eminem’s most successful and celebrated songs, Stan, about an obsessive fan who sends the rapper a series of increasingly disturbing messages.It’s also the second stalking case involving a celebrity to have reached court this week.Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, 48, was charged with stalking, vandalism and threat of bodily harm after allegedly crashing his car through the front gate of actor Jennifer Aniston’s Los Angeles home on Monday.Carwyle is also accused of harassing Aniston for two years with messages over voicemail, email and social media.He appeared shirtless and wrapped in a blanket at a court hearing on Thursday. A lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Judge Keith L Schwartz said Carwyle must have a mental health assessment to determine if he can face the charges. Carwyle was ordered not to have any contact with Aniston.Aniston and her legal team have not commented on the charges.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 10:49",
            "content": "“It was just a tree,” said a mystified Adam Carruthers, one of the two men who illegally cut down the tree at Sycamore Gap in the early hours of a stormy night nearly two years ago. “It was almost as if someone had been murdered.”Carruthers was right about the reaction to the felling. Many likened its loss to that of a good friend or relative. Its destruction prompted feelings of sadness, grief and then blind fury. Some people wept.Carruthers was wrong to see it as just a tree. It was a beautiful, life-enhancing place for countless photographs, declarations of love, engagements, birthdays and ash scatterings but it was also more than that. Many considered it part of the DNA of north-east England. Its felling was seen as a symbol of humanity’s wider war on nature. Its legacy is fast becoming one of hope and optimism.What is certain is that none of these emotions or complexities or nuances were in the minds of Carruthers, 32, and Daniel Graham, 39, when they travelled from their homes in Cumbria over the border to Northumberland on 27 September 2023.As Storm Agnes raged, the two friends set off in Graham’s black Range Rover Sport with a chainsaw in the boot. When they got to the tree, which has stood on Hadrian’s Wall since the late 19th century, they set about deliberately and methodically cutting it down. They apparently saw it as a laugh.One man cut the tree down while the other filmed him on Graham’s iPhone 14.After the footage, lasting two minutes and 40 seconds, was shown to a packed courtroom in Newcastle there was silence. It was terrible and upsetting to watch. The judge ordered a 15-minute break.The film, enhanced by police experts, shows a silhouetted man wielding the chainsaw. Its dreadful, piercing revving echoes through the windy emptiness. After the revs comes the sound of the tree cracking and crashing down on to the wall.It took minutes to destroy a tree which had stood for more than 100 years, the prosecutor Richard Wright KC said.At the time of the offence, Graham lived in a caravan on land in a hamlet near Carlisle from where he ran a groundwork business. Carruthers, a father of two including a new baby, was living with his partner in a caravan in Kirkbride.The pair became “obsessively” close friends after the death of Graham’s father. Carruthers repaired the father’s Land Rover in time for his funeral and Graham was grateful.Graham claimed Carruthers had a “fascination” with the tree and thought it would be a good trophy. He alleged Carruthers even had a length of string in his workshop which he used to measure the tree’s circumference and kept for sentimental reasons.After felling the tree the two men drove back and Carruthers’ partner, the mother of his newborn daughter, sent him a video of their baby being bottle-fed. Carruthers replied: “I’ve got a better video than that” before sending footage of the tree being felled.The next day police receive a report that the tree had been damaged. People first assumed it was the result of the storm which had battered Northumberland that night.Soon it emerged that the tree had been cut down deliberately. The tree became famous after it appeared in the film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves with the characters played by Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman passing under it as they walked along the wall.Kim McGuinness, then Northumbria police and crime commissioner and now metro mayor, said the felling was like “stealing joy”. Because of time differences there are stories of people in the UK first hearing of what had happened from relatives in other parts of the world.The first police officer on the scene was PC Peter Borini, who knew the Sycamore Gap tree well. The jury watched footage of him walking through wet grass to the felled tree and immediately treating it as a crime scene, asking people to move back and putting down tape.As anger grew, Carruthers and Graham revelled in the headlines. Voice messages found on phones included Graham saying to Carruthers, whose nickname is Jeffrey: “Jeffrey, it’s on fucking Sky News, as we speak.” Then: “Jeffrey, it’s gone viral. It is worldwide. It will be on ITV News tonight.”In another they made fun of a social media comment saying the perpetrators were weak.“Weak … fucking weak? Does he realise how heavy shit is?” asked Graham.Carruthers replied, saying he would like to see the commenter “launch an operation like we did last night. I don’t think he’s got the minerals.”A wedge of wood which had been photographed in the back of Graham’s Range Rover was almost certainly from the Sycamore Gap tree, according to a forensic botanist.Graham and Carruthers were first arrested and questioned on 31 October and both men denied involvement.Graham said he had been “stitched up” and he knew who was accusing him. He said he was being framed for the crime as part of a dispute, with someone “stirring the pot”.Both men said they did not have the skills to cut down such a large tree. Carruthers, a mechanic, said he thought chainsaws were “nasty things” and he would rather “stick with spanners”.In the police interviews Graham refused to name who was responsible, saying he was not a “grass”.At the trial, however, he blamed Carruthers, saying his friend had a “strange interest” in the tree. “At the time I didn’t know of the tree,” claimed Graham. “He told me it was the most famous tree in the world.”Graham accepted that his car and his iPhone had been used in the felling of the Sycamore Gap tree but claimed he was not there, rather, he was asleep in his caravan with his dogs after taking a sleeping pill.Carruthers, in his defence, offered no thoughts on who was responsible but insisted it was not him. He, too, was at home.He denied sending Facebook messages to his partner while driving back from Sycamore Gap. He said he was actually sending messages while they were both in the same caravan because he did not want to wake her up.There were other similarly implausible claims which a jury at Newcastle crown court found to be lies.The prosecution said the pair loved how the felling of Sycamore Gap went viral. They sent message after message, revelling in their infamy. They thought themselves “funny or clever or big”, Wright said.The tree itself was probably planted in the late 19th century by a man whose name will be familiar to anyone who knows Newcastle, where Clayton Street was once an important shopping destination. It was home to Woolworths and many clothes shops, such as Geordie Girl.It was named after John Clayton, the city clerk who worked with the architect John Dobson and the builder Richard Grainger to redevelop Newcastle’s centre in the neoclassical style. It was Clayton’s decision to plant a sycamore tree in a dell on land he owned just because it was a beautiful spot.According to the National Trust’s Andrew Poad: “He was an incredibly visionary man. A real unsung hero. He planted it as a landscape feature in the full knowledge he wouldn’t see it in his lifetime. He took the long-term view.”And that view has been the driving force behind everything that has happened since the felling.Saplings grown from seeds recovered at the site have been titled “trees of hope” and 49 of them – one for each foot of its height – have been given to good causes across the UK. They will grow at a motor neurone disease centre being named after the late rugby league star Rob Burrow and in the memory of Holly Newton, a Northumberland schoolgirl murdered by her coercive ex-boyfriend.King Charles, the nearest school and the nation’s 15 national parks are also receiving saplings.The tree has also been used as art, including as part of an exhibition by the artist Charlie Whinney last year.It was never just a tree. The nature writer Robert Macfarlane sees its felling as a prompt to people to consider their relationship with the natural world.The tree is gone and for a long time it looked like that would be that. Then last summer something remarkable happened: fragile green shoots were spotted emerging from the tree’s stump.“To see signs of life … is astonishing,” said Poad. What view future generations have of Sycamore Gap is an unknown – but there will be one.",

            "title": "Willkommen, bienvenue! New festival celebrates translated fiction from Cameroon to Slovakia as sales boom",
            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/may/09/translated-by-bristol-festival-literature-translation-translators",
            "content": "A new festival of translated literature is being launched in Bristol next week amid a sales boom in translated fiction in the UK.Translated By, Bristol is the brainchild of Polly Barton, author and translator of the award-winning Butter by Asako Yuzuki, and Tom Robinson, owner of Gloucester Road Books, which is organising the festival alongside Barton and another independent Bristol bookshop, Storysmith.“Translated fiction becoming more popular in recent years has not necessarily led to a greater appreciation for the work of translators, or much consideration of the act of translation itself,” says Robinson. “We wanted to think about whether there was something we could do that would address both of these concerns.”The festival, which runs 12-25 May, will feature a conversation between five translators shortlisted for the International Booker prize and a “translation duel” – in which translators debate their translations of a text in front of an audience – among other events.UK readers continue to have strong appetites for translated fiction, with Butter selling almost 250,000 copies in the UK last year. Social media buzz around particular titles has helped shift copies: Ros Schwartz’s translation of Jacqueline Harpman’s I Who Have Never Known Men, a favourite on “BookTok”, sold 45,000 copies last year, an elevenfold rise on 2022 sales.Festival organisers were aware of increased interest in translated literature from readers, meaning they felt the festival “would have a breadth of appeal it might not have done, say, five years ago”, says Barton.A central reason for the recent success of translated literature is the work of independent publishers such as Fitzcarraldo, Peirene and Comma, say the organisers. Those presses “tend to be more willing to take risks”, adds Robinson.One of the key aims of the festival is to showcase a “breadth of languages and geographies, beyond the major languages and locations of Europe, which tend to occupy so much focus”, says Robinson.The programme features an event on translating the work of the Cameroonian poet Jean-Claude Awono and another with Hassan Blasim, who writes in Arabic, along with his translator Jonathan Wright. The festival will also host a conversation between two prominent translators of Latin American literature, Frank Wynne and Annie McDermott.“We also have events featuring European languages that aren’t the five or so that get the most attention,” says Barton, with conversations about books translated from Slovakian (This Room Is Impossible to Eat by Nicol Hochholczerová, translated by Julia and Peter Sherwood) and Danish (Iron Lung by Kirstine Reffstrup, translated by Hunter Simpson).Barton sees this approach of “actively looking beyond our immediate borders” as helping to “resist the political currents promoting xenophobia, prejudice and cultural homogeneity”.The festival will also see Max Porter talking to two of his translators, Saskia van der Lingen (Dutch) and Charles Recoursé (French). It will close with the translation duel, featuring Adriana Hunter and Wynne. “The language of the slam this year is French, and we’re distributing the text to people in advance, so there’s the opportunity for people with a little French knowledge to have a go themselves if they like,” says Robinson.Duels are an “excellent way of opening up the process for people and allowing them to get a sense of how creative translation really is”, adds Barton. Translated By, Bristol is on 12-25 May",

            "content": "The Premier League has asked clubs to give broadcasters the right to film inside dressing rooms or conduct in-game player interviews during live coverage from next season. A new domestic TV deal worth £6.7bn over four years begins in August and Sky Sports and TNT Sports want more for their money, with the league supporting their demands.The league is understood to be consulting with clubs over enhanced access for rights holders and wants an agreement before its AGM next month. Some clubs are more open to allowing broadcasters to film in their dressing rooms, with certain managers resistant to letting cameras into what they regard as their inner sanctum.The traditional Big Six are believed to be pushing back. There is a suspicion at some clubs that the Big Six are resisting because they want to save behind-the-scenes content for their own channels, which they can use to market to their fans and increase their already significant commercial advantage. The league needs 14 clubs to take its side if it is to make a contractual commitment to the broadcasters.Under the league’s proposals each club would be obliged to allow dressing-room access, a half-time player interview or an interview with a substituted player at two home games. The broadcasters are most interested in dressing-room footage but the other options have been included as a concession to win over the most reluctant clubs.The league is understood to have warned clubs that without offering broadcasters more access the value of future TV rights deals is likely to decline. Although the value of the league’s TV deal has gone up for the next cycle, this has been achieved only by offering 70 more live games each season. The price per game paid by Sky and TNT has decreased significantly from £10.19m between 2016-17 and 2018-19 to £6.2m over the next four-year cycle.Overseas TV rights are continuing to rise, with the league’s contracts between 2025 and 2028 worth £6.5bn, but foreign rights holders are also demanding more, particularly NBC in the United States.Several clubs including Brentford, Brighton, Wolves and Nottingham Forest have run trials with cameras in their dressing rooms over the past couple of years. The Premier League champions are obliged to allow crews to film celebrations in their dressing rooms after winning the trophy.Bournemouth were the first club to offer a substituted player interview, with Marcus Tavernier speaking to Sky Sports after he was taken off in their 3-1 win over Southampton last October, and an audio clip of Thomas Frank giving a pre-match team talk before Brentford hosted Arsenal in January went viral after being posted by TNT Sports.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionSky Sports will broadcast a minimum of 215 live Premier League games next season, up from 128, and believes it has to offer viewers more for their subscription. Next season in the Premier League camera crews will be allowed on to the pitch to film goal celebrations. Camera operatives using so-called Steadicams, who often enter the field at the final whistle, will be allowed to record players’ reactions to take viewers closer to the action.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/09/ipl-cricket-suspended-indefinitely-india-pakistan-tensions",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 10:26",
            "content": "The Indian Premier League has been suspended, initially for a week, because of concerns about the security situation in the country amid rising tensions along its border with Pakistan. The news came hours after the decision was taken to relocate the final fixtures in the Pakistan Super League to United Arab Emirates because of safety concerns. Foreign-based players in India and all teams in Pakistan are expected to leave the countries over the next 24 hours.“Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” Devajit Saikia, the secretary of the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI), said in a statement. “The decision was taken by the IPL governing council after due consultation with all key stakeholders following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans; while the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.”Transport within India has been complicated by the closure of 27 airports over security concerns, including in the host city of Dharamsala. Thursday’s game there between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals was abandoned after 10.1 overs, with the players and staff of the two teams rushed out of the ground. They mingled on each other’s coaches, with some still wearing their pads, before returning to Delhi by chartered train on Friday morning.Thursday’s abandonment came with Mumbai Indians, who had been due to face Punjab Kings in Dharamsala on Sunday, already on their way and precipitated rapid negotiations in which the possibility of holding the fixture in Mumbai was discussed and rejected before the teams settled on the neutral venue of Ahmedabad. MI’s players duly travelled to Gujarat, where they learned of the league’s suspension, and their foreign-based players will now return to Mumbai to collect their belongings before returning home.Dharamsala is about 80km from Pathankot, site of one of the three Indian military bases targeted by what officials described as “missiles and drones” on Thursday, leading to the decision to abandon the game. “It does not look nice that cricket goes on while the country is at war,” a BCCI official told the news agency PTI.With 58 games played and 12 group-stage fixtures remaining, plus four playoff ties, the BCCI must now decide if and how to complete the competition. The option of relocating to the UAE – where the tournament was shifted when it was forced to shut down by the Covid outbreak of 2020 – is off the table because it is already set to host the PSL, but a move to South Africa is feasible, aided by the fact that all six teams in that country’s own franchise tournament, the SA20, are controlled by owners of IPL sides. The IPL was also moved to South Africa in 2009 when it coincided with Indian elections.The last time the IPL was shut down, when Covid flared up again in 2021, it resumed and concluded in the UAE that September, and a resumption later this year, after the conclusion of India’s Test series in England, is possible. India are due to play six white-ball matches in Bangladesh in August followed by the eight-team Asia Cup in September, which they are due to host. Both are considered likely to be cancelled, opening a possible window for the IPL to resume in the middle of the English summer, clashing with the Hundred and the knockout stages of the T20 Blast.Meanwhile Thursday’s PSL match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings was postponed amid claims that an Indian drone missile had damaged the area around the stadium in Rawalpindi where it was to be played, an attack which was described by Mohsin Naqvi, chair of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), as “extremely irresponsible” and “reckless”.Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotion“The PCB has always stood by the position that politics and sports need to be kept apart,” Naqvi said in a statement. “However, in view of the extremely irresponsible and dangerous Indian act of targeting the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, which was manifestly done to disrupt the ongoing Pakistan Super League, the PCB has decided to shift the remaining matches to UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers, who are our precious guests, can be saved from the possible reckless targeting by India.“As a responsible organisation that has overcome adversities repeatedly and ensured that the game of cricket flourishes, it was important for us to ensure the mental well-being of all players participating in the PSL. I regret that our domestic audience and cricket lovers will not be able to watch these matches in Pakistan’s stadiums.”Ten English players are currently involved in the IPL: Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton, Phil Salt and Reece Topley. Seven are playing in the PSL: Sam Billings, Tom Curran, Chris Jordan, Tom Kohler-Cadmore, James Vince, David Willey and Luke Wood.",

            "content": "Michael Shannon was a teenager when he first heard REM. “I was out at my cousin’s trailer; he lived in the country. He put Document on his little cassette recorder, and I sat in his room with him and listened to it. Any art I find compelling is usually because it seems singular, like the people who are making it are the only people that could be making it.”Shannon is used to making singular art himself, as a distinctive presence in notable films for many years: Nocturnal Animals, Knives Out, The Bikeriders, The Shape of Water, Bullet Train and more. But he can also sing – in George and Tammy he played the country legend George Jones opposite Jessica Chastain as Tammy Wynette, doing all his own performances.Not for him, though, the vanity album. Instead, Shannon has taken to the road, with a band put together by US indie-rock lifer Jason Narducy backing him as he performs REM’s back catalogue. First it was 1983 debut Murmur played in full, now it’s 1985’s Fables of the Reconstruction, a show that is coming to the UK later this year. Shannon turns his face away for most of our video call, but leans in with questions about their London dates: “What neighbourhood is the Garage in? Is it near the Almeida [theatre]? I want to be there. We’re coming over to your flat before the show!”Shannon and Narducy first met in 2014, when the musician Robbie Fulks invited them to help him perform Lou Reed’s album The Blue Mask in Chicago. The two took that ball and ran with it, playing a different classic album in that city every year – the Modern Lovers’ debut, Neil Young’s Zuma and the Smiths’ The Queen Is Dead among them.But REM was the mother lode, and for Narducy part of why he started playing music. “They had a punk rock ethos,” he says. “They were anti-Big Rock Band, but they didn’t sound punk rock at all. So they were mysterious to me, but immediately engaging. And I think a lot of that had to do with the sadness in the music. Mike and I talk about this all the time, about how decades later, this music is still so profoundly moving.”Shannon chips in. “And I certainly think as a lyricist, Michael Stipe is a truly unique and very effective communicator, considering that people tend to go on at length about the inscrutability of some of his lyrics. I would argue that there’s not a more efficient and direct communicator in the history of rock’n’roll frontmen.”Playing Murmur in 2023 got them offers to gig nationwide. When they played at the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Georgia, in February 2024, the whole of REM turned up; when they returned in February this year, REM didn’t just turn up, they all played with Shannon and Narducy. “It was emotional,” Narducy says. “There were people crying and screaming. You couldn’t help but get wrapped up in the emotion of it.”Shannon is more circumspect. “Honestly, the main thing I’m thinking when [REM] come up is that I want them to enjoy being there. It’s their moment. It’s their music. It’s their house. It’s a big leap of faith for them to walk up there and do that with us.”Narducy says that his and Shannon’s versions of REM songs “don’t sound much like REM did when they played them at the time”. Again, Shannon counters this a little: “We are very faithful to the records. The one exception is me. We’re steeped in the source material; we spend a long time studying it before we even get together in the room. Everybody takes a lot of pride in paying attention to the little details: if you listen to early bootlegs of REM live, they sound a little sparse and they’re not able to do everything on the record.”Is it a privilege to have the status that you can get a crack backing band – with REM themselves or not – to play these songs you love, for you to sing? “Everything is a privilege,” Shannon says. “I’m just glad I’m not on a plane to El Salvador. It’s a privilege to be able to walk around freely.” But, he concedes, “the world is very dark, and the timing of this has ended up being a beautiful thing. We did our first press for this the morning after Trump had won, and we were both pretty despondent. But the tour seemed to give everybody a boost, including us. It’s wonderful to remember there’s music that can transport people to a time and place in their lives that’s separate from all the insanity.”He must really take pleasure in singing to go out on tour doing it. “Pleasure? I don’t know. I sang when I was a boy. I was in a choir. And I’ve written some of my own music and sung that from time to time. No matter what I do, some people will appreciate it and some won’t. It’s not a numbers game for me. It’s a lot more spiritual than that.” Michael Shannon and Jason Narducy’s Fables of the Reconstruction tour of the UK and Ireland begins 19 August",

            "content": "Midsummer butterflies are on the wing in early May after a sunny spring prompted one of the most advanced seasons for Britain’s Lepidoptera on record.The Lulworth skipper – usually found in June and July – is flying at Lulworth Cove in Dorset, the chequered skipper emerged in April rather than mid-May in Scotland and the first swallowtail, which is most common in mid-June, was spotted in Norfolk on 1 May.“The chequered skipper is a butterfly you can set your calendar by – it typically comes out 13-15 May,” said Tom Prescott, the head of Butterfly Conservation Scotland. “I was absolutely staggered when it was seen on 26 April.”Lepidopterists said the early appearances this year were caused by the prolonged sunny, dry spring but were also a clear sign of insects responding to global heating.While some species appear to be adapting their lifecycles to climatic changes, there are fears some early emerging insects may fall out of sync with pathogens, predators or the availability of food for their caterpillars.“It’s fine for the chequered skipper but I worry for some butterfly and moth species that are overwintering as an egg and trying to emerge as a caterpillar in sync with the leaf flush,” said Prescott. The caterpillar of the rare dark bordered beauty moth feeds on sucking aspen but if the fine spring causes it to emerge too early there won’t be any leaves for it to eat.Many butterflies are emerging at least two or even three weeks earlier than normal this spring. The average first sighting of the swallowtail over the past 10 years has been 14 May but this year it was spotted at Norfolk Wildlife Trust’s Hickling Broad nature reserve on 1 May.Both the swallowtail and the Lulworth skipper sightings on 2 May were the second-earliest recorded emergence over the past two decades, with only 2011 being a similarly early spring. In the 1980s, the Lulworth skipper emerged in early July.The marsh fritillary was first seen on 20 April this year – in Wiltshire – three weeks before its first sighting in 2024. The wood white also popped up three weeks earlier than last year, first spotted flying through Devon and Dorset woodlands on 9 April.Although the early butterflies are a sign of the pace of climate breakdown, Richard Fox, the head of science at Butterfly Conservation, said picking the optimum time to emerge was a challenge that most Lepidoptera could probably meet.“Whilst there is potential concern about decoupling – coming out of sync with host plants or pathogens or predators – all of the things in these biological food webs are responding to the weather and climate change in the longer term, and doing so at different rates, with different flexibility,” said Fox.“There’s a lot of inter-individual variation in butterfly and moth populations, so not all swallowtails are going to come out on 1 May. If the weather has tricked some into coming out too early it should not be a disaster. There should also be plenty of scope for evolutionary adaptation.”Sign up to Down to EarthThe planet's most important stories.

The holly blue has moved from Edinburgh to Aberdeen in recent seasons, while the comma has colonised the Highlands.Last year was the second worst for common butterflies since scientific monitoring began 50 years ago and butterfly experts are hoping that the sunny spring enables populations to recover some of their numbers.“It’s been a wonderful spring for butterflies in Scotland,” said Prescott. “The butterflies are on the wing much longer and many species are moving north rapidly.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 10:00",
            "content": "The Runcorn and Helsby byelection belongs in the rubbish bin of politics. British byelections are charades, mock polls, playtime for pundits. They reduce normally sensible analysts to hysterics. That most pragmatic of prime ministers, Harold Wilson, refused point blank to comment on them.Yes, Reform’s Nigel Farage had a field day. He is the latest jester to be cast as “Britain’s next prime minister”. For the past week, his party has celebrated winning Runcorn by six votes, with 39% of roughly half of the eligible electors who bothered to vote. He also won two of the six new regional mayoralties, and may control some 10 local councils. The media went berserk. The BBC gave Reform a total of 31% vote share in the local elections, making it the largest party. Tories were at “a new low” and Labour a mere ghost of a party.To the election guru John Curtice, Farage and Reform now “breach the barrier hitherto presented by first past the post”. He had finally challenged the British constitution and jeopardised Kemi Badenoch’s Tory leadership. The BBC declared that were a general election held now, Keir Starmer’s Labour would be down to 20%, as if his sensational victory last year were some forgettable mistake.We should first recall that Reform’s predecessor, Ukip, enjoyed similar projections after performing equally well in local and European elections from 2014 to 2019. At the high point of Brexit, it also smashed records and was said to have demolished the two-party system. Yet Reform, Ukip in all but name, gained just 14% of the votes at last year’s general election, marginally ahead of the Liberal Democrats’ 12%. People may have wanted Brexit in the past, but they did not want the party of Brexit in power in Downing Street.There is nothing new in Reform UK. History’s most sensational third-party byelection was in 1962, when the Liberals won Orpington. Their candidate slaughtered the governing Tories with 53% of the vote, way ahead of today’s Reform. The Liberals’ poll rating went from 6% to 26% almost overnight, and the press loved it. With one voice it declared the end of two-party politics. So-called Orpington man was born, and Liberals won or almost won five successive byelections. The Tory government, a decade in power and moribund, was pronounced dead and the Liberal leader, Jo Grimond, was tipped as prime minister.Twenty years later, in 1981, it was Labour that was moribund under Michael Foot. The Social Democratic party (SDP) surged into the lead, and its candidate Shirley Williams won the Crosby byelection with about 50% of the vote, ahead of Reform today. The next year, Roy Jenkins won Glasgow Hillhead with 33%. Betting was heavily on Jenkins as the next prime minister. Yet by 1987, the SDP had allied with the Liberals and together they fell back to 24%. What the alliance did do was split the left, savaging Neil Kinnock’s Labour and keeping the Tories in power for another decade.Farage’s five MPs last year may have been a grim comment on the UK’s first-past-the-post democracy, but Reform was well behind the nationalists in Scotland and Wales, and only a little ahead of the Lib Dems. The blunt reality is that byelections, like local council ones, are mere irrelevant snap popularity polls on national party leaders, given Britain’s centralised politics. Turnouts are roughly half those at general elections, while “swings” against ruling parties tend to double. They are just that – comments – and probably from the respective parties’ more active extremes. Hence the current fixation on immigration. Parliamentary elections are wholly different. They are the public’s formal choice of whom it wants as prime minister.At last year’s general election, Reform did to the Tories what the Liberals have so often done to Labour: divided a party’s natural supporters into rival loyalties. Thus Reform let Labour amass its second-greatest ever number of MPs despite the party winning just 34% of the poll. Labour never “won” the 2024 election. The election was lost by the 38% of voters divided between Tory and Reform. A more truthful voting system would have delivered a Tory-Reform coalition.Of course, there are caveats. Reform appear to be mopping up votes from left as well as right. But the same applied to many Liberal surges in the past. The centre has always been soggy, but first past the post is an iron taskmaster. Farage would need a massive and persistent support base and show himself its competent leader – more than was ever achieved in the past by the Liberals or the SDP.Wonders rarely happen in British politics, and not much wonderful happened last week. If I was Farage, I would gather my small band of MPs and apply for the Tory whip. Capture the party from within. But if I was Starmer, I would be exceptionally nice to both Farage and Badenoch. Long may they wage their war for the soul of Toryism. That rivalry is pure gold.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

            "content": "Last month, the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) held an official draw in Miami, Florida for the 2025 Gold Cup, the premier biennial tournament for men’s football on the continent.This summer, the Gold Cup will serve as the crucial litmus test for the US national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup, the vast majority of which will take place on home soil. The draw placed the Americans in Group D, alongside Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago … and Saudi Arabia.Why is a Middle Eastern country on the Asian continent in a regional competition half a world away? The answer lies in some of the strange twists that world football tends to take.The Kingdom is Concacaf’s official “invited guest” of the tournament, continuing a tradition that started early in the tournament’s founding, during which time the likes of Brazil, South Korea, and South Africa were among the guest nations to take part. The practice was abandoned in the early-00’s, but was restarted in the 2021 edition when Qatar, another authoritarian gulf state, was invited to take part the year before the nation hosted the World Cup. They returned for the 2023 edition, as well. Concacaf announced Saudi Arabia as the guest participant just eight days after the Kingdom secured the 2034 World Cup in December 2024.“We are very pleased that through our relationship with the Asian Football Confederation we have been able to collaborate with the Saudi Arabian Football Federation and their President Yasser Al-Misehal, both on and off the pitch,” Concacaf president Victor Montagliani said in the official press release. “We look forward to welcoming one of Asia’s top men’s national teams to compete with the best in Concacaf.”The top three teams in the Gold Cup – the US, Canada, and Mexico – are already qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup as co-hosts. What they needed were serious opponents in a competitive setting. Instead, they got Saudi Arabia–a team currently struggling in its own World Cup qualification campaign – granted a spot not on merit, but seemingly in exchange for a hefty financial contribution to Concacaf.Excluded from the press release announcing Saudi Arabia’s Gold Cup participation is Concacaf’s partnership with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) – the state-owned sovereign wealth fund chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The injection of funds from the PIF is expected to boost soccer development in the region, with more tournaments for men, women, and youth participants. “Together, we will advance a series of initiatives to create a positive and lasting impact across all Concacaf competitions,” Mohammed AlSayyad, head of corporate brand at PIF, said at the time.It’s not the first and will hardly be the Saudi regime’s last effort to turn the entire world of sports to its advantage. Over the past few years, the PIF has reshaped global sports through aggressive investments and strategic acquisitions aimed at bolstering the kingdom’s global influence and soft power. From acquiring top-tier soccer clubs like Newcastle United to ambitious plans in boxing, golf, and esports, the PIF has enabled the Saudi regime to exploit sports as a diplomatic and economic tool, while raising concerns about conflicts of interest, governance, and the growing authoritarian grip on world sports.Concacaf’s deal with PIF notably comes after the confederation designated Aramco, the Saudi state-run oil company, as the “official energy partner” for all of CONCACAF’s national team and club competitions. The confederation then announced that Riyadh Air would be the “official airline partner” in a multi-year deal. The PIF-owned airline, which is also a shirt sponsor of La Liga side Atlético Madrid, is yet to officially launch.The U.S. government has also shown concerns for the PIF’s dealings in the United States. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, has been investigating how the Saudi state is using its sovereign wealth fund to buy influence in the US, including its ongoing bid to create a merger between the Saudi-owned LIV Golf league and the PGA Tour. In an attempt to hinder the investigation, however, the PIF has filed lawsuits in Saudi Arabia seeking to block four PIF consultants, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company, M. Klein & Company, and Teneo–all headquartered in the United States–from responding to subpoenas issued by the subcommittee.In April, Blumenthal released a new report on his findings into the 2023 framework agreement between the PGA Tour and the PIF, alleging that the PIF only tried to negotiate with the PGA Tour in order to avoid discovery.“Our report reveals how present laws may enable foreign influence without transparency,” Bluemnthal said. “Very simply, our present defenses do not protect against increasingly sophisticated threats.”Blumenthal’s report lands as the Trump administration actively undermines the US government’s capacity to combat foreign influence, scaling back enforcement of things like the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) and hollowing out the very departments tasked with investigating foreign influence efforts. It’s a vulnerability the Saudi government is well positioned to exploit, particularly through PIF’s expanding footprint in global sports.By weaponizing sports as part of its national strategy, the Kingdom is deepening its influence in North America, bolstering its global image ahead of the 2034 World Cup, and dismantling scrutiny over its human rights record, one critic at a time – the soft power equivalent of a perfectly timed goal.Saudi Arabia’s participation in the Gold Cup isn’t just about football. It’s a calculated strategy rooted in geopolitical maneuvering and influence management. The Gold Cup is merely the latest arena in which the Kingdom is flexing its growing influence.Karim Zidan is the Sports & Dictators fellow for the Human Rights Foundation.

            "content": "Survivors of forced adoptions and unmarried mothers’ homes will gather at the first-ever public commemorations of a national scandal affecting hundreds of thousands of British people.A plaque will be unveiled at noon on Saturday at an open event at Rosemundy, St Agnes, in Cornwall. Meanwhile, in Kendal, Cumbria, on 23 May, a memorial garden will be opened, with attendance by invitation.Women from across the country, adoptees and relatives are expected to attend the events – at the locations of two former unmarried mothers’ homes – after years of waiting for a formal UK government apology.There were hundreds of unmarried mothers’ homes operating in the UK between the 1940s and the 1980s. Run by the Church of England, Salvation Army and the Catholic church, working alongside statutory bodies, they promised to protect women and girls from stigma and destitution. Instead, many faced cruelty, neglect and lifelong trauma. Women have described being made to work in punitive regimes and were often pressured into handing over their babies to be rehomed with married couples.“If the government won’t apologise, at least they can be a point of healing for people,” Phil Frampton, a campaigner from Manchester, said of the commemorative events, which he said were the beginning of “a long-overdue national movement”.Diana Defries, from the Movement for an Adoption Apology, said: “The significance cannot be overstated. It’s the first time we can stand in front of the cameras and say, it happened here, it happened to all of these people. It will finally be a very public recognition of this injustice.”Frampton campaigned for the plaque at Rosemundy, where he was born. Facing stigma as the white mother of a mixed-race child in the 1950s, his late mother, Mavis Frampton, was compelled to give him up to the care system and his Nigerian father was removed from the country. Having obtained his own records, Frampton said the system was driven by a desire to keep welfare costs down as well as “rotten” societal prejudices.Lyn Rodden, from Camborne, faced “non-stop” pressure to give her baby up at Rosemundy, where she was among teenagers subjected to unpaid labour, even after her waters had broken.“We were literally slaves to them, it didn’t matter what condition we were in. People think that it was only in Ireland and it was never like it over here – it damn well was,” she said.The 88-year-old, reunited with her son in adulthood after years of their lives “crisscrossing”, said the Rosemundy plaque means “everything … because so many people called me a liar”.In further evidence of the devastating impact of the forced adoptions system, research by Michael Lambert, of Lancaster University, has indicated the use of the lactation-suppressing drug diethylstilbestrol, which has been linked to an increased risk of cancers, in some unmarried mothers’ homes, while an ITV investigation has revealed unmarked graves across England contain the bodies of babies who did not survive.Steve Hindley, 79, from Salford, campaigned for the Kendal memorial garden near the former St Monica’s home, where his late wife, Judy Hindley, was sent, aged 17, in 1963, before they met.Traumatised Judy took her life in 2006, near Parkside cemetery, Kendal, where babies including her 11-week-old son Stephen were buried in unmarked graves. Stephen had been denied care for hydrocephalus and spina bifida.The Parkside cemetery memorial, Hindley said, would provide “dignity at last” for the babies.A 2021 parliamentary inquiry found there were 185,000 adoptions involving unmarried mothers in England and Wales between 1949 and 1973 alone, based on “re-registrations” of babies “born out of wedlock”, and that the state was ultimately responsible for the suffering caused by public institutions and employees involved.Scottish and Welsh governments have formally apologised, but the UK government refused the recommendation of a formal apology in 2023, and has not provided one since Keir Starmer took office.Meanwhile, the Church of England has expressed “great regret”, the Catholic church has apologised and the Salvation Army has said it was “deeply sorry”.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “This abhorrent practice should never have taken place and our deepest sympathies are with all those affected … we take this issue extremely seriously.”",

He introduced me to lasagne, which I pronounced “la-sign”. It was the 1980s. I got told off all the time for reading at the dinner table.My favourite book growing up\n  After my nanna’s Mills & Boons, stolen from her bedside table, I’d have to say Lucy Maud Montgomery’s Anne of Green Gables. Another iconic ginge. Also Anne and Gilbert were the greatest “will they/won’t they?” until Mulder and Scully in The X Files.The book that changed me as a teenager\n  Like a lot of 90s teenagers, I loved Judy Blume’s Forever. Thanks to Judy for putting it all out there, especially birth control. Not sure I’ll ever get over the idea of a penis called “Ralph”, but on the demystification front it was otherwise flawless.The writer who changed my mind\n  In my early 30s Jennifer Egan showed me what books could do; the playfulness of A Visit From the Goon Squad was really inspiring. I’m also grateful to Maggie Nelson for The Argonauts, and to other writers who have written about motherhood and bodies so honestly and brazenly.The book that made me want to be a writer\n The Romantic poets are to blame for this! All those passionate feelings and excesses. And the symbolists. Let’s chuck them in there. I was a wreck when I discovered Yeats. I genuinely think most of my career has been a massive “I’ll show you” campaign in reaction to Yeats.The book or author I came back to\n I didn’t get Patricia Highsmith for a long time. People kept telling me to read her but I kept getting stuck. Then I hit my 40s and something clicked. Now I think Strangers on a Train must be one of my favourite books, and such an education in how to write effective, elegant humour.The book I reread\n Wintering by Katherine May. I find this book so soothing. I listen to it on audiobook, over and over. It’s such a good antidote to the stresses of modern life. I feel like it resets my nervous system. I dip in and out of it, like an ice bath. Which is possibly the most middle-aged thing I have ever said.The book I could never read again\n Anything by anyone I’ve ever dated and then been ghosted by, you know who you are.The book I discovered later in life\n  All Fours by Miranda July was like a bomb in my life, in a good way. I had a deep fantasy life with it for four days in the Lake District last October when I was away on a writing trip. It was such an intense experience I blush when I think of that book. I returned a changed woman. Not menopausally. Although that is relevant.The book I am currently reading\n Ben Elton’s and Ben Miller’s books for kids. I’m reading them with my eight-year-old son and loving them. Just the warmest, smartest, loveliest things for him to get his head into. My four-year-old daughter is into Jon Klassen – she’s got a dark sense of humour. We’re also rereading The Magic Faraway Tree which they don’t find as exciting as I did but I think it’s probably because they have the internet, which is basically the same thing except you don’t have to climb a tree. In my grown-up reading life, Nussaibah Younis’s Fundamentally and Anna Whitwham’s Soft Tissue Damage have been my companions these past few weeks and I’m enjoying them both very much.

            "content": "Raise a glass to Gregg Popovich, the gruff teddy bear who lifted the San Antonio Spurs into the NBA’s elite. After three decades on the Spurs’ sideline, he is stepping back from coaching to become the team’s president of basketball operations. It’s a back-to-the-future move for the 76-year-old: he was the Spurs’ general manager for eight years before he became the team’s coach. (“I’m no longer the coach, I’m El Jefe,” Popovich jokingly declared this week before unveiling a T-shirt with that Spanish title.) Altogether, Pop won five NBA championships from 1999 through 2014, a run that puts him among the greatest coaches in league history. But when it came to being the NBA’s unflinching statesman, he was in a league all by himself.Popovich wasn’t just the NBA’s backbone. He was, perhaps, the most fearless truth teller in all of sport. Certainly no one was bolder when it came to taking on Donald Trump – whom Popovich has described as a “soulless coward,” a “pathological liar” and a “deranged idiot”. Popovich told beat reporters he was “sick to my stomach” after Trump’s 2016 presidential election win, a tipping point he likened to the fall of Rome. He slammed Steve Bannon’s appointment as chief White House strategist as a fear-mongering exercise. During the Spurs’ 2017 media day, Popovich launched into a 21-minute condemnation of Trump and the Maga movement after the president attacked NFL players and Nascar’s Bubba Wallace for their national anthem protests. “Our country is an embarrassment to the world,” Popovich said. “This is an individual that when people held arms during games, [he thought] that they were doing it to [dis]honor the flag. That’s delusional. But it’s what we have to live with.”Whenever the stakes were highest culturally and politically, Popovich was the coach you could most count on not to stick to sports. During the NBA’s celebration of Black History Month in 2018, Popovich held forth on the subject of systemic racism and acknowledged his own white privilege. “If you were born white, you automatically have a monstrous advantage – educationally, economically, culturally, in this society,” he said. “It’s a tough one because people don’t really want to face it.”Through it all, he maintained a wry sense of humor. When reporters questioned the Spurs’ losing streak in 2019, Popovich used it as an opportunity to indirectly criticize Trump. “Whoever started the rumor that we’re losing these games, it didn’t happen,” he joked. “It’s a witch-hunt. I see treasonous behavior. I see spies. They’re all sick.”Popovich follows in a rich NBA coaching tradition of speaking out that started when Boston’s Red Auerbach used his considerable power to knock down barriers for Black players. And when Popovich began speaking out against Trump, he didn’t lack support from his peers. Stan Van Gundy, the former Detroit Pistons coach turned broadcaster, called out Trump’s “misleading” anthem protest attacks in a Time Magazine op-ed. Golden State’s Steve Kerr, a key player on two of Pop’s championship teams, echoes Popovich’s outrage on all things Trump and Trump-adjacent. Mike Budenholzer supported a player-led decision to boycott a 2020 playoff game in protest at the police shooting of Jacob Blake while coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, sparking a wave of walkoffs across US sports.But where Van Gundy and Budenholzer are respected for their opinions outside the game because of their stature in it, and Kerr – whose father was murdered while serving as president of the American University of Beirut – is blood-bound to rebuke immorality in all its forms, it hits different when Popovich enters the chat because he comes from a background that chimes with many conservatives in America. Popovich played college basketball at the Air Force Academy in the 1960s and was the team’s captain and leading scorer his senior year. After graduating with a degree in Soviet studies and serving his required five years, he considered a career in the CIA before starting his coaching journey as an Air Force assistant in the early 1970s.When Peter Holt bought the Spurs in 1993, one of his first moves was to bring back Popovich as general manager. (Pop got his NBA start with the Spurs in the late 80s, as the right hand to coaching legend Larry Brown.) Popovich helped realize the NBA’s global ambitions and organized his rosters around Frenchman Tony Parker, Argentina’s Manu Ginobili and Tim Duncan – a competitive swimmer from the US Virgin Islands who retired as the game’s greatest power forward.Popovich’s coaching style wasn’t always appreciated in its heyday, before the current 3-and-D era took hold. Casual fans dismissed the Spurs’ dogmatically unselfish brilliance, the apogee of Brown’s play-the-right-way ethos, as a bore even as San Antonio piled up the victories – first with Naval Academy hero David Robinson, then Duncan, then perennial All-Star swingman Kawhi Leonard. And while Popovich was hard on his players – not least Duncan (who was frequently made an example of for the greater good) and may have cost himself more rings by losing his patience with Leonard (whose frequent injuries and sporadic availability proved frustrating), the coach’s compassion won out more often than not.Stories abound of Pop’s personal touch. He might scold a reporter, Bill Belichick-style, but he also might help that same reporter land another job if his newspaper suddenly folded, or support another through his cancer fight. (Even a question as simple as How are you doing? might elicit a sincere response from Pop.) He was quick to wisecrack in his own huddle and break the tension on court. LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Steph Curry wouldn’t have started the league’s wine obsession without Popovich – the NBA’s king oenophile – breaking out his rare bottles for boozy Team USA dinners. (“He would always come around the table and tell everybody what the wine was that he was serving that evening,” Kerr said in a 2000 interview, recalling the Spurs team dinners. “It became a point of real connection between Pop and the players.”) Popovich liked to joke that the best wines in his collection were older than Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio’s current French phenom.But during the team’s exhibition trip to Paris earlier this year, Wembanyama hosted the boozy team dinner while Popovich stayed back in the US to recover from a stroke that would eventually lead to his stepping down. After suffering another health scare last month, Popovich fully relinquished his coaching duties. As much as it smarts to not see him go for a sixth title with Wembanyama after keeping the Spurs fighting during fallow times, it just means Popovich can finally get to work on what would be his boldest statement yet: installing Becky Hammon as the NBA’s first female head coach.Hammon, who was on Pop’s staff for seven seasons, has been dodging succession rumors for years. “My heart’s a little heavy for him because I know how much he loves it, but I’m sure he’ll crush this role just as much,” says Hammon, a championship-winning coach with the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces. “He’s a huge reason why I have this job.” (Don’t hold your breath on Hammon as the Spurs’ next coach, though: she went on to say she is “super happy” in the WNBA, but wouldn’t rule out a return to the NBA down the line.)History will remember Popovich as one of sport’s all-time winners – the notable coach who beat super-squads built by Phil Jackson and Pat Riley. Meanwhile, the head coaching success of Hammon (two WNBA titles), Kerr (four NBA titles), and Budenholtzer (one, with Milwaukee in 2021) as well as former assistants Ime Udoka (Houston) and Will Hardy (Utah) speaks volumes to Pop’s wider impact in the game as a mentor. But Popovich’s ultimate legacy as a league statesman stands for all time and leaves a void that even Kerr, his chief envoy, will struggle to fill. But then again who knows if Kerr will even have to? While Popovich may be stepping back from the sideline, one expects his voice will still resonate simply because there’s no chance of him simply sticking to sports. Not with the stakes still so high.",

            "content": "America is back, baby. Not only has the Gulf of Mexico been successfully Americanized, the Vatican is now officially US territory. OK, fine, not officially, but, on Thursday, the Chicago-born Robert Francis Prevost was announced as pope. The 69-year-old, who has taken the papal name Leo XIV, is the first clergyman from the United States to lead the Roman Catholic church.While Prevost was a frontrunner for the papacy, his victory seems to have taken many experts by surprise. There has long been resistance to an American pope for a number of reasons, including the fact that it might make it appear as if the Vatican is aligned with the world’s strongest economic and military power.“If the Catholic church were also run by an American, the global dominance of the US would be simply pervasive and overwhelming,” Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a watchdog group that tracks clergy child abuse cases in the Catholic church worldwide, told ABC News recently.I’ll tell you who doesn’t seem particularly overwhelmed by the first American pope: Donald Trump. The president has spent the last few days posting AI-generated pictures of himself as the pope and generally mocking the Catholic church. Still, Trump was on his best behaviour when the official announcement came through, and posted a fairly restrained message on Truth Social, congratulating the pope and saying it was a “Great Honor for our Country”.Just give it a few days, though, and I’m sure Trump will be on Fox News taking credit for the new pope and announcing that the Vatican is going to get rid of all their dusty old Bibles and replace them with the Trump God Bless the USA Bible. Only $99.99 for the platinum edition and a bargain $74.99 for the pink and gold edition!Vice-President JD Vance, one of the last people to see Pope Francis alive, also posted a diplomatic message of congratulations, saying he was “sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for [Pope Leo’s] successful work leading the Church”.I am not an American Catholic. Nor am I Protestant, Episcopalian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist or anything else. I am an atheist, although not a terribly devout one. But I am certainly praying as hard as I can that Pope Leo will be the moral leader that the world so desperately needs at this moment.For most of my life I have not been particularly interested in who the pope is. And I have had very little faith that the Vatican, which covered up systemic sexual abuse, could ever be a real force for good. But – and I know I am not alone when I say this – the past 19 months has fundamentally changed how I see the world. I used to believe in things like international human rights law. I used to believe that while the arc of the moral universe may be extremely long, it bends toward justice. I used to believe that universities would stand up for free speech. And I used to believe that no matter how craven western world leaders might be, they wouldn’t go so far as to enable the livestreamed genocide unfolding in Gaza. That western leaders wouldn’t stand by and cheer as Israel, whose total blockade on Gaza has entered its third month, starves children to death.During a time when international law has been dealt a deadly blow, when might is right and decades of progress seem to be unravelling, the late Pope Francis made an impression on non-Catholics like me for his moral clarity towards many marginalized groups and his advocacy for peace everywhere from “martyred Ukraine” to Gaza. Of course, his legacy is not perfect: many abuse victims have questioned whether he went far enough in acknowledging children sexually abused by clergy. But Pope Francis undoubtedly fought for the most vulnerable in society.Pope Francis also understood what many newspaper editors and politicians don’t seem to be able to comprehend: that there is no “both-sidesing” atrocities. That there are times where you must take sides because, as Desmond Tutu said, “if you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”In 2023, for example, Pope Francis went on a historic trip to South Sudan and told churches in the region that they “cannot remain neutral” but must speak up against injustice and abuse of power.Pope Francis also visited the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023, where he criticized the “poison of greed” driving conflict in the region. “Hands off the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Hands off Africa. Stop choking Africa: it is not a mine to be stripped or a terrain to be plundered,” Francis said.When it came to Gaza, Pope Francis spoke clearly and powerfully. He would call the only Roman Catholic church in Gaza almost nightly after this iteration of the conflict broke out. When so much of the world seems to have turned away from Gaza’s suffering, Pope Francis let anguished civilians know he cared. One of his last wishes was that his popemobile be turned into a mobile health clinic for children in the Gaza Strip.And Pope Francis was not shy about criticizing the US – consistently speaking up for immigrants and refugees. “We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories,” he told the US Congress in September 2015.We do not yet know how Pope Leo will undertake his duties but he is widely considered a centrist who was aligned with Francis on a number of social issues. Notably, in February Leo tweeted an article that disagreed with Vance’s views on immigration, headlined “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others”. In April, he also retweeted commentary criticizing Trump deporting a US resident to El Salvador.Whether Pope Leo will remain outspoken, whether he will continue Francis’s demands for a ceasefire in Gaza, remains to be seen. But the world desperately needs strong moral leadership at the moment. May Leo be the light we need in the current darkness. And, for his own sake, may he stay away from Vance.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

            "title": "‘If I had to choose, I’d prefer the earthquake’: the 2015 disaster left Nepal in ruins, now record rains wreak fresh havoc ",

            "content": "When the monsoon rains came last September, they swept away most of the village of Panauti, in the foothills of the Nepali Himalayas. The Roshi River overflowed after the unprecedented rainfall, triggering landslides and destroying most of the roads and bridges.Peering through the thick blanket of relentless rain “felt like waiting for morning to arrive so we could see the world again”, says Bishnu Humagain. “We lost everything – our home, our agriculture, and all of our belongings.”In Kathmandu, 20 miles away, 244 people died as the capital recorded its highest rainfall in more than half a century.For Humagain, 45, it was the second time that he had to start again: in 2015, an earthquake left almost 9,000 dead and crumbled about half a million homes across Nepal, including his. In the years since then, Nepal has been slowly rebuilt, drawing up disaster-preparedness plans to help build resilience against future catastrophes.A decade on, the worsening climate crisis is beginning to test that fragile balance. Nepal’s topography leaves it vulnerable to floods and landslides and this is exacerbated by increasingly erratic rainfall patterns. Studies suggest the Himalayas are warming up to 0.7C (1.26F) faster than the global average.Birendra Bajracharya, of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), a regional research institute, says: “Climate change is making resilience efforts more challenging, as we are observing disasters with a frequency and magnitude never seen before.”With funding from Nepal’s government already stretched, the withdrawal of USAID support for disaster-preparedness and climate-resilience programmes has added to the strain.“Adding to the financial crunch that is already there, this is another setback,” says Sangeeta Singh, professor of urban planning at Tribhuvan University and a former member of Nepal’s National Planning Commission.An initiative partly funded by USAID known as Servir, which used satellite data to “address critical challenges in climate change, food security, water and related disasters”, has been hit by the cuts, says Bajracharya.Nepal received an outpouring of international support after the 2015 earthquake, with billions of pounds pledged for reconstruction by countries such as India and China.Multilateral agencies, such as the UN Development Programme and the Asian Development Bank, helped the government in initiatives to “build back better”, sharing lessons on resilent design and building codes. International money and expertise helped to build wider roads, and incorporate bioengineering technology for slope stabilisation and drainage.Those lessons proved essential for mitigating climate-related disasters. Dharam Uprety, of Practical Action Nepal, says: “Now people don’t only think about the earthquake, because Nepal is exposed to many other hazards.” Increasingly, he adds, “resilient infrastructure is coming into the discussion at policy and community level.”Another important development after 2015 was the formation of Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority in 2017, with a focus on preparedness. Before the earthquake “this kind of institution was not there,” says Sagar Shrestha, the Nepal Red Cross Society’s crisis management director.The disaster highlighted the importance of local response, he says, when damage to roads gave access challenges for national and foreign emergency responders. “The more it’s localised, the better,” he says.Sign up to Global DispatchGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamafter newsletter promotionNepal’s Red Cross raises awareness in remote areas on how to respond during earthquakes and flooding. Running disaster simulations while collecting data on regions most at risk helps the organisation prepare, he says.Resilience, a “buzzword” since 2015, appears now on paper but Singh says implementation and funding often fall short in reality. “When it comes to budgeting, then this is not taken into consideration.”Climate disasters can be as destructive as earthquakes but get less global attention and international funding. Shrestha believes they deserve the same level of concern.During the September floods, the downpour was so intense his team couldn’t reach the community for four days. “I have never experienced such continuous rainfall,” says Shrestha.But despite the severity, the attention is “not happening”. “That is also very frustrating for us,” he says.The Trump administration’s aid cuts exacerbate the shortfall. In April, it was reported that the Millennium Challenge Corporation – a US foreign aid agency focused on building infrastructure in developing countries, and seen as a response to China’s Belt and Road initiative – was being shut down by Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency. One of the halted projects was a $500m (£375m) grant towards energy infrastructure and 200 miles of road repairs.Without the money, Singh worries construction quality will suffer. With connectivity essential for development, the government has prioritised infrastructure projects – but without money, standards can slip.“Everybody knows that [the roads] have to be resilient. It’s only that they don’t have the money to do the protective works,” says Singh. Construction in mountain areas heightens flood and landslip risk, obstructing the natural flow of water.Complacency is also a problem, says Bajracharya. Over the years, fear of another earthquake subsides and people become “less serious on following the regulations”.“Settlements on flood plains and haphazard construction of roads in mountain areas are big challenges,” he says.Policies fall short, says Singh, particularly in built-up areas where economic growth can takes precedence over resilience. Only after the earthquake did people understand the importance of open spaces, she says.“There are no significant changes in the regulations when you plan an expansion of a residential area,” she says, leading to dense urban design and overuse of drainage-limiting concrete.Urbanisation has also led to encroachment on flood plains. In Kathmandu, one of the buildings damaged by the September floods was a large hospital, leading to the emergency evacuation of patients. It had been built on a flood plain.With the monsoon season approaching, flooding is on people’s minds. The 2015 earthquake destroyed Humagain’s house, but the floods had a longer-term impact, he says. “All my land has been washed away, and now the river is flowing through my fields.”“We are struggling just to survive,” he says.“If I had to choose between the two, I would prefer the earthquake.”",

Will Hayward will also continue in his role as a regular Guardian columnist on Wales.McKernan has anchored the Guardian’s reporting of the Middle East and the events that have unfolded in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories since the October 7 attacks. Having worked in the region for 10 years, her experience, judgment and contacts have been at the heart of the Guardian’s impressive and comprehensive journalism on a difficult and complex story.Speaking of the appointment, editor-in-chief Katharine Viner said:“I’m delighted that the Guardian is to have our first Wales correspondent in many years, and that someone of Bethan’s calibre will be in the role. Expanding our coverage of Wales is part of our ongoing commitment to increasing on-the-ground reporting across the UK: we now cover Britain outside of London much more fully, with journalists based in Scotland, Manchester, the north-east, the Midlands, the south-west and now Wales. “We believe we have a responsibility to understand local communities and report on the issues that impact them, which often differ significantly from those facing Londoners. Wales is a crucial part of the British story, as well as having a distinct identity, politics and culture of its own, and Bethan could not be better placed to report on it.” Bethan McKernan said:“I’m delighted to be coming home to Wales. I am returning after a decade working in the Middle East as a different person, and Wales is a different country to the one I left. We’re a year out from the Senedd elections and Wales’ political sphere is changing fast, which has implications for the rest of the UK too. The country’s traditionally rock-solid support for Labour has collapsed, while Plaid Cymru’s independence movement and the far-right Reform party are both surging. “Wales is so often neglected in the national conversation and the ways its government, society and culture differ from the rest of the country often misunderstood. I’m looking forward to helping change that, building on the Guardian’s track record of rigorous public interest reporting.” -ends-Notes to editorsGuardian News & Media press office: media.enquiries@theguardian.comAbout the Guardian Media GroupGuardian Media Group is amongst the world’s leading media organisations.

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 09:52",
            "content": "The governor of the Bank of England has said that the UK now needs to do everything it can to rebuild its long-term trade relationship with the EU, after a breakthrough agreement with the US to reduce some of Donald Trump’s tariffs.Andrew Bailey said that, while he would not pass judgment on the UK’s exit from the EU in early 2020, reversing the trade impact of Brexit would be “beneficial”.The government is in talks with the EU – after moves by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, to “reset” trade relations since Labour came to power last year – before a summit in London in 10 days’ time where a new UK-EU partnership is expected to be unveiled.“Having a more open economy to trade with the European Union … would be beneficial,” Bailey told the BBC, “because there has been a fall-off in goods trade with the EU over recent years.”The EU remains the UK’s largest trading partner, but in sectors such as food and drink exports have fallen by more than a third since Brexit.“It is important we do everything we can to ensure that whatever decisions are taken on the Brexit front do not damage the long-term trade position,” said Bailey. “So I hope that we can use this to start to rebuild that relationship.”Earlier this week, the UK agreed a long-desired trade deal with India. Starmer described the agreement, which took more than three years of negotiations under successive governments, as a “landmark deal” that would cut tariffs and add £4.8bn a year to the UK economy by 2040.Bailey said the UK’s deal-making was setting an important example to other countries. “It demonstrates that trade deals are important,” he said. “Trade deals can be done, and the trade is important … Honestly, it seems an unpromising landscape at times. But I hope that we can use these deals to rebuild the world trading system.”The UK-US deal would benefit trade, even though tariffs on most British exports to the US would remain higher than they were before last month, he said later at an economics conference in Reykjavík, Iceland.He aded: “It’s good news in a world where it will leave the effective tariff rate higher than it was before all of this started.”Speaking at a conference hosted by the Icelandic central bank, Bailey said Threadneedle Street needed to be “nimble” in its response to developments in the global economy, especially as countries reacted to the increase in US import tariffs.He said the Bank had maintained a target for inflation of 2% in good times and bad and proved to the public that the aim could be achieved in all economic weathers.Bailey said: “We need no reminder that the global economic environment is likely to continue to be challenging – and less predictable – than it was in the past.“So we need to adapt and develop to ensure that our processes are nimble and robust, and that our monetary policy decisions are communicated effectively, while ensuring that we continue to act methodically in response to inflationary pressures.”Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionOn Thursday, the Bank cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% to cushion the UK economy against the impact of rising global economic uncertainty.The narrative from the Bank’s monetary policy committee, which accompanied the decision, indicated a reluctance to make further rate cuts without greater certainty that inflation would fall back to 2% within the next two years. Inflation stood at 2.6% in March and is predicted to rise later this year.Business groups and unions said they were dismayed that further rate cuts may not be imminent.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the TUC said that the Bank’s economists underplayed the downturn and the need for cheaper borrowing to boost growth.David Bharier, head of research at the BCC, said surveys showed small and medium-sized businesses’ confidence had fallen in response to “the twin developments of domestic tax rises and a global trade war”.He said: “Many firms, desperate for financial respite, will be keen to see further rate cuts in the months ahead.”The TUC said households needed greater support from lower interest rates.",

            "content": "The Devils by Joe Abercrombie (Gollancz, £25)\n  Bookish Brother Diaz is stunned to be made vicar of the Chapel of Holy Expediency, whose congregation – a necromancer, a vampire, a werewolf, and an elf – are tasked with escorting a claimant to the imperial throne to her coronation. This is Suicide Squad in a sideways medieval Europe, where instead of the son of god we have a daughter, instead of a cross, a wheel, and instead of Byzantium, Troy. The worldbuilding is one of the novel’s chief pleasures, combining the familiar – crusades, religious schisms and territorial disputes – with strange and alien elements, such as the lost empire of Carthage, which built most of the world’s major cities before succumbing to its own dark magic. Against this backdrop, the sardonic crew of the Chapel make their way through a series of elaborate, violent set-pieces, barely escaping with their lives while causing mass death and property damage, and quipping relentlessly. This is enjoyable, particularly as we get to know characters such as Vigga, a happy-go-lucky Viking werewolf, and Sunny, a supposedly soulless elf who is the novel’s most ethical character. Eventually, however, it becomes repetitive, and the book’s sequel-bait ending is not entirely enticing.The Incandescent by Emily Tesh (Orbit, £20)\n  Turning the magical school story genre on its head, Tesh’s follow-up to the Hugo-winning Some Desperate Glory focuses not on precocious teenagers but on their teacher. Saffy Walden is director of magic at the prestigious Chetswood boarding school. When her A-level invocation class accidentally call up a demon much more dangerous than they can handle, Saffy must rise to the school’s defence, while also juggling budget meetings, difficult colleagues and a board who want to blame the whole mess on a talented scholarship student. Tesh is doing a lot of things with this novel. It is first and foremost a love letter to teachers, repeatedly making the point that their work is not only hard, but multifaceted and creative; but it is also a meditation on the pleasures of growing up – past the age where, most school stories tell us, all of life’s adventures happen, but which the novel insists is where the joyful work of becoming yourself can actually begin. And it’s a sharp indictment of the fact that a truly top-notch education remains accessible only to a privileged few. The result is a clever twist on a familiar fantasy story, starring a winning, flawed, undeniably grown-up heroine.Land of Hope by Cate Baum (Indigo Press, £12.99)\n  Fleeing arrest and infamy as the wife of a notorious serial killer, Hope reinvents herself as a hermit living on the outskirts of a remote village on the north English moors. When a mysterious sound causes the deaths of the other villagers, Hope finds herself caring for the sole survivor, a young boy. Setting out across a landscape that soon proves eerily lifeless, Hope tells herself that she is delivering the boy to his relatives, while plotting to reunite with her incarcerated husband, whom she fears and longs for in equal measure. Told in a propulsive, invented vernacular that ranges across valleys and crags, abandoned abbeys and ancient standing stones, Land of Hope combines folklore and history with the bizarre effects of a disaster whose full scope is never revealed, and Hope’s sometimes defiant, sometimes guilt-stricken memories of the monstrous acts she witnessed – and perhaps participated in. This muscular, disquieting twist on survival stories such as The Road asks whether the end of the world is a chance for a new beginning, or whether some acts stain the soul too deeply ever to be left behind.A Line You Have Traced by Roisin Dunnett (Magpie, £16.99)\n  Three women – Jewish Bea, in the pre-second world war East End; Kay, her great-granddaughter, and Ess, a member of a commune in a climate-ravaged future – are united by time travel, mysterious visitations, and the thorny question of childbearing. Struggling with infertility and with her husband’s too-close friendship to an insinuating would-be revolutionary, Bea takes comfort in sightings of beings she has dubbed angels. Purposeless Kay fantasises that people around her are time travellers for whom she is a vitally important figure. Against their lack of political awareness – Bea stumbles unawares into the Battle of Cable Street, Kay struggles to hold the attention of science fiction author-turned-activist O - stands Ess’s deep devotion to the principles laid out by O in her manifesto, including the necessity of commune members sterilising themselves as humanity’s time has ended. Yet it is Ess who is recruited to travel back in time to meet O, inadvertently contacting Bea and Kay. The slightly unreal tone does not undercut the characters’ despair at the state of the world, and the juxtaposition of their timelines is a reminder that even in the darkest times, there is always a next chapter.",

            "content": "Rene Matić’s nomination for the 2025 Turner prize was announced the week this exhibition opened. Only one photographer has ever been awarded the prize – Wolfgang Tillmans. Matić is not a technically masterly photographer, but a quiet observer of things, like Tillmans. Matić riffs on a documentary, diaristic style of photography, with snapshots of everyday moments and poetic juxtapositions, which are then used to create installations, grouping images to surreptitiously bring out buried tensions and paradoxes. Where those tensions have often been urgent and angry in Matić’s previous exhibitions, this new show highlights another facet of their work. It is perhaps Matić’s most personal exploration yet.Although these installations are evocative slices of life, it’s the whiteness of the gallery’s walls and ceiling that you notice first. Their sharp, stark white engulfs the contrasting small-scale obsidian pictures, scattered across the wall like dark gems on a pristine beach. The whiteness is overbearing and cold, but it also emphasises the lustrous quality of the black-and-white pictures. This plays symbolically into Matić’s concern with the rubric of whiteness in British society, and how blackness lives within, alongside or outside it. Their images describe what many of us mixed-race people in the UK experience as being in-between, something Matić has termed “rude(ness)”. The simple choice, to make the pictures small and place them sparsely on the white wall, makes you experience this “rude(ness)” concept visually.Blackness and whiteness are important to Matić’s identity. They are also important in making a photograph. These images are the result of Matić’s first forays into the darkroom, developing silver gelatin prints. The care this involved was fitting for the pictures, which are all personal – showing the artist’s inner circle. They portray a journey inwards and towards those closest, to the people and things that make a person who they are. As the title suggests, there are intimate images of family members, friends, partners, self-portraits. It is all explored with the feeling of being close enough to reach out to one another: in one, Touching Campbell’s Face, Matić does just that. The portraits, particularly the one of a heavily pregnant friend, are about how bodies of loved ones can be entire worlds.There are also shadows, hinting at the absent, unknown parts of ourselves, made visible by the light. There are cultural objects that have shaped Matić’s understanding of their own identity: a vintage first-edition copy of James Baldwin’s Another Country reclining in a luxurious heap of rumpled bedsheets and pillows; a Nina Simone vinyl record; a lineup of Matić’s collection of figurines by St Martin de Porres, the 16th-century Peruvian lay brother canonised as the patron saint of mixed-race people and all those seeking racial harmony.By formal standards, the photographs are mostly good. What makes them interesting is the way Matić arranges them, sometimes placed coming towards each other, sometimes heightening the tensions of difference, moving against each other. Some of the sequences are looser. Four images side by side portray a friend and frequent muse, the playwright Travis Alabanza, wrapped in a white towel; and another friend Grace, backstage before a performance at Ugly Duck, a LGBTQIA+ arts organisation in London. The Simone record. We see another friend, Mia, at the kitchen table, a nod to Carrie Mae Weems. Mia is surrounded by empty bottles – the air seems thick with the intimacy of a late-night moment.Each feels like a private performance for Matić’s camera. In another image, another kind of implied performance, Matić’s blond wig and black platform shoes are cast off, abandoned on the floor. The sensation is of Matić shrugging off the mask, feeling safe.Matić’s body throughout remains only half-revealed, though: smoky, soft images of their legs, their shadows. In one image, we see the photographer’s reflection in a mirror, holding the camera, an apparition above a clutch of cherished family pictures at their granny’s house. A reconciliation of sorts comes in paired mother and father portraits, both shown holding cigarettes. At this point, you realise what else this show is telling you: it all begins with love. At Arcadia Missa, London, until 3 June.",

            "content": "As the crowd outside a gallery in central Berlin filters indoors to get out of the rain, a man in a bright red T-shirt wearing cartoonishly large metal-framed glasses heads in the opposite direction.With a retro futuristic yellow bike helmet under his arm and an orange backpack stuffed full of rain gear slung over his shoulder, Patrick Jambon, a 58-year-old Frenchman, leaves Galerie Neu and makes for his bike. The rain is not stopping him from making the most of Berlin’s gallery weekend, when many of Berlin’s 400-plus galleries exhibit new shows over three days.Because Jambon, who goes by the nomes de plume “Mr Jambon” or “Turbojambon”, is not visiting galleries as an ordinary culture vulture, but as part of a non-stop performance art piece, now entering its 25th year.Every day Jambon spends a few hours compiling a list of gallery openings from websites such as Index Berlin and social media accounts, jotting each opening on a scrap of paper. Then he begins hitting the galleries on his list, going from one to the next while decked out in his vibrant outfit and bug-eye glasses. He calls it his “gallery project”.“You aren’t a real Berlin artist if you don’t know him,” says the Korean visual artist Ae Hee Lee. Always the most colourfully dressed in the room, he sticks out at any opening he attends, and he attends many. In the 25 years that Jambon has lived in Berlin, he estimates that he has been to more than 6,000.When Berlin gallery weekend comes around, Jambon’s project goes into overdrive. Several years ago, he went to 25 galleries in a single day. This year, Jambon went to just over a dozen, but his project was present in more ways than one. Ducking into Berlin-Weekly, an art project space in Mitte, Mr Jambon pointed to a framed piece of paper with small handwriting in neat vertical columns. It was one of his gallery opening lists. Berlin-Weekly’s featured artist and curator, Sebastian Klug, had asked Mr Jambon if he could include one of his lists in the show. “It’s part of the arts scene,” Klug says.Originally from Lyon, France, Mr Jambon moved to western Germany when he was 21 to study animation and video art at the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf and the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne.In his early 30s, he had grown tired of sitting in front of a computer to work on his animations, so in 2000 he decided to move to Berlin and pursue performance art. “Relatively early on I realised that I missed interacting with an audience,” Jambon said at a gallery opening in Berlin in late November.In the German capital, he started to attend public events dressed as portable structures made from ready-made objects: a ladder on his head that grows taller as people add more rungs, a monitor strapped to his back on which strangers can play video games, a karaoke machine hanging on his chest. His goal is to interact with his audience and get them moving. “People think that performers have to do something, to be active, and that the onlookers must be passive,” Jambon said. “I want to reverse this.”Over time, he simplified and intensified his practice. The portable structures mostly stayed at home, but Jambon continued to go out. Before moving to Berlin, Jambon wasn’t much of a gallery fiend, but “when I came to Berlin, I didn’t know that many people so I started going to many galleries and exhibits,” he said. “It became a habit.”What started as a habit developed into an everyday performance. “I don’t do much, but I interact with the public,” he says.Throughout his gallery crawl last Friday night, people wave, smile and shake his hand. One young man standing outside gallery HVW8 Berlin in Mitte shouts “Hi” as Jambon bikes by. Another person stops him outside gallery BQ in Prenzlauer Berg to ask if he’s seen anything good today. A third approaches him outside Dittrich & Schlechtriem gallery near Rosa Luxemburg Platz to ask which galleries are still open.“Many people say hi to me, but I don’t know who they are, or sometimes I only remember who they are later,” Jambon says.But as the night goes on and the crowds thin out, artists and curators sip wine outside closing galleries, and Jambon’s interactions become more drawn out. Outside Galeria Plan B, Jambon strikes up a conversation with someone he hasn’t seen in a while.“Are you still making your lists?” the man asks Jambon.“It’s the longest list I’ve ever made,” Jambon replies, holding it in front of him as the guy snaps a photo.Jambon used to be part of an entire scene of Berlin performance artists who embraced a similar practice. There were EVA & ADELE, an androgynous Austro-German artist duo who pretended to have visited Berlin from the future and announced: “Wherever we are is museum”. There was Konstantin Schneider, who called himself Kunstkontakter and visited galleries with a camera attached to his hard hat.But when Jambon bumped into Schneider at a gallery earlier this year, his former comrade-in-art was in “incognito mode”: his health, he said, had forced him to dress up less and attend fewer galleries. Since the pandemic, Jambon says, he has seen a drop among gallery-goers. While many arts spaces in Berlin were able to survive lockdown due to Berlin’s generous state funding for the arts – subsidies that have recently been drastically reduced – he estimates that people simply lost their habit of attending gallery opening. “There are some people I never saw at exhibitions again,” he says.Still, Mr Jambon plods along with his project. “Some people leave or go elsewhere,” he says, “but there is no real alternative. There is no city like Berlin anywhere else.”",

But there’s still a lot of familiarity in his ancient Roman sequel – from returning characters to elaborate fight scenes and animal antics. Paul Mescal stars as Lucius, the son of Russell Crowe’s Maximus, who is living a quiet life in north Africa until an invading Roman army take him into slavery. From there, it’s a short hop to becoming a gladiator and reviving his father’s rebel stance, while his owner, Macrinus (a lip-smacking Denzel Washington), plots to overthrow the unstable twin emperors. Mescal is more of a brooder than Crowe, which lends the film an elegaic, end-of-an-era feel. \n   Monday 12 May, Paramount+There is a bomb on a Los Angeles bus that will detonate if it drops below 50mph.

Reeves’s potential as an action hero had been unearthed in Point Break a few years earlier and is enhanced in Jan de Bont’s brilliantly tense thriller, aided by his great chemistry with Bullock. Top-notch stunt work rounds out a perfect popcorn flick. \n   Saturday 10 May, 11.10pm, ITV1Nicholas Ray’s western is one of the great misnamed films. Sterling Hayden’s titular gunslinger does kick the plot off, but it’s his old flame, saloon owner Vienna (a fierce, forceful Joan Crawford), who is the drama’s blazing heart. With a railroad being built nearby, she faces opposition from townsfolk who fear change – and blame her for it, not least Mercedes McCambridge’s Emma. But in this classic of queer coding, does Emma’s wrath hide a secret desire for Vienna? Check out Crawford’s costume changes for a sign of who wears the trousers round here. \n   Sunday 11 May, 12pm, Great! ActionThe subculture of urban dirt-bike riding in France is a fruitful milieu for Lola Quivoron’s involving drama. Julie Ledru plays Julia, a motocross devotee who edges her way into an all-male group of riders through her skill at stealing bikes. Her tentative friendship with the imprisoned gang leader’s neglected wife and son gives this outsider a sense of belonging, but her independent attitude – and gender – cause hostility from some of the guys. Ledru, continuously on screen, is compelling as a woman who knows she’ll only get what she wants in life by taking it. \n   Sunday 11 May, 1am, Channel 4Sign up to What's OnGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Mondayafter newsletter promotionLorna Tucker, who directed Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist, delves into the life of another grand cultural figure in this beguiling documentary.

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/09/more-than-a-third-of-uk-agricultural-soil-degraded-by-intensive-farming-report",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 09:00",
            "content": "More than 60% of the EU’s agricultural soils are degraded due to intensive agriculture, with similar damage to about 40% of British soils, a report has found.Experts from the Save Soil initiative said nourishing and restoring agricultural soils could reduce the impact of the climate crisis and provide protection against the worsening extremes of weather, as well as the food shortages and price rises likely to accompany them.This degradation of soil is changing the land’s water cycle and exacerbating the impact of the climate crisis in a vicious circle. Impoverished soils, lacking their natural structure, are incapable of holding water in any quantity, so that when it rains, the water tends to run off them, worsening flooding; but in times of drought, when healthy soils would act as a sponge, poor soils have little resilience.Save Soil, which advocates regenerative farming practices, called for soil restoration to be made a key priority of climate programmes, and for changes in agricultural policies and subsidies to reward it.“Europe and the UK are experiencing extremes – parched fields one month, flooded towns the next. What this report makes clear is that our soils are no longer buffering us,” said a spokesperson for the group. “We are losing the natural infrastructure that manages water.”In 2022, a third of the EU population and 40% of the bloc’s land were affected by water scarcity, while Spain, Italy and Germany have also seen disastrous floods in 2023-2024, the report noted. Groundwater levels have dropped by a third in France, and the UK is likely to see drought this year despite record rain last year.Nearly half of the global urban population, about 2.4 billion people, will face water scarcity by 2050, according to the UN. Price rises of some commodities affected by the climate crisis, including coffee and chocolate, are already being seen by consumers.Last year, a UN study found an excess of salt was already reducing the fertility of at least 10% of land globally, while a further 1bn hectares were under threat. Healthy soils also store more carbon, helping to offset the impact of fossil fuels.Sign up to Down to EarthThe planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essentialafter newsletter promotionKaren Johnson, professor of environmental engineering at Durham University, who was not involved with the report, said: “Soil is a living material intimately connected to human and planetary health and it is only by working with soil as a living material that we can address the global challenges [facing] water. Let’s work with the soil microbiome instead of against it – we may as well harness over three billion years of evolutionary knowledge.”Hannah Blitzer, a senior policy officer at the Soil Association, called on the UK government to take action: “It is essential that soil is better protected – the UK government should give this vital resource the same protection as water and air, while also backing nature-friendly farming like organic that puts soil health first. This means moving away from reliance on harmful artificial pesticides and fertilisers and switching to building resilience in soils through nature-based solutions.”In the UK, farmers can be paid to protect and restore their soils through government schemes. However, one of the key programmes, the sustainable farming incentive, has been paused, and funding for nature-friendly farming is under threat as the Treasury reviews expenditure, leaving farmers in doubt over whether to invest in changing their practices.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “This government recognises the importance of healthy, functioning soil for resilience against the impacts of climate change, such as flooding and drought and to protect food security. That is why we are taking action through agri-environment schemes to encourage land management practices that focus on a sustainable approach to farm and soil management.”",

            "content": "Golliwog has the ambience of a horror movie: dissonant strings, like nails on a chalkboard, form the basis of the track Star87; agonised screams are sampled throughout; every so often, an ominous drone will fill a song to the point of overwhelm. On that level alone, New York underground icon Billy Woods’ latest album would be a feat of sound design, and one of the year’s most engrossing, unnerving records. Of course, this being a Billy Woods record, that’s just scratching the surface.Golliwog’s horror aesthetics are a counterpoint to its tales of real, everyday nightmares. Through samples, guest verses and his own lyrics, Woods unearths innumerable images of inhumanity: stories of CIA torture methods, “12 billion USD hovering over the Gaza strip”, a class of professional “zombies” willing to turn a blind eye to the working class that makes luxury possible.It’s heavier, if only slightly, than Woods’ usual output. He still finds time for moments of beauty amid the bleakness – the gorgeous saxophone that ends Maquiladoras; the fuzzy synth sample on Pitchforks & Halos; the beat on Make No Mistake that feels almost adjacent to dance music – but Golliwog is dominated by inherited trauma and state-sanctioned terror, and Woods assesses it all with horrible clarity. You could call it a haunted house of an album, but that would be optimistic – you’d be hard-pressed to believe Woods sees a clear way out.",

            "content": "The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, could replace Mark Dreyfus as attorney general in Labor’s second term cabinet, amid speculation senior ministers Mark Butler and Jason Clare face moves to new portfolios.Friday’s meeting of Labor’s expanded caucus confirmed Victorians Sam Rae, Daniel Mulino and Jess Walsh would join the ministry, while the NSW senator and assistant trade minister, Tim Ayres, will also be promoted, possibly to the industry portfolio.Rae and Ayres are both members of Labor’s powerful national executive.Dreyfus, the attorney general since 2022, was cut from cabinet after the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, and factional bosses moved against him this week. The industry minister, Ed Husic, will also be demoted due to an overrepresentation of the NSW right faction on Labor’s frontbench.Both men unsuccessfully appealed to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for intervention. The trade minister and powerful factional boss, Don Farrell, supported the moves.Western Australian MP Anne Aly, the minister for early childhood education and youth, could also join cabinet as part of the changes, which will be formally announced on Monday.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailFactional infighting overshadowed some of Labor’s victory celebrations on Friday, with some in the government and the wider party questioning the message sent to voters by moves to dump the government’s most senior Muslim and Jewish members.Guardian Australia was told Albanese did not acknowledge Dreyfus or Husic in the jubilant meeting at Parliament House. Husic was not present as new MPs were formally admitted to the parliamentary party and a routine ballot for positions in the ministry was conducted.Rowland, a member of the NSW right faction, was a senior lawyer at Gilbert + Tobin before entering parliament in 2010, specialising in competition and regulation in telecommunications, media and technology. She has previously represented Dreyfus as acting attorney general.The industrial relations minister, Murray Watt, is another name speculated for the vacant attorney general position.Under Labor’s rules, the factions put forward names for the frontbench, and the parliamentary leader assigns portfolios.Mulino, the MP for the Victorian seat of Fraser, is a Yale-educated economist highly regarded in parliament. He could fill the assistant treasurer role left vacant by Stephen Jones’s retirement.One Labor source suggested Clare could move from education to communications.Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotionThe disability and government services portfolios could also be given to new ministers next week.Butler, the health minister and a close ally of Albanese, said he would serve in whatever role the prime minister offered him.He told Sky News he felt for Dreyfus and Husic after they were dumped from cabinet.“It’s tough,” he said. “Politics is a tough game, and they’d be feeling very, very hurt right now, I’m sure.\n “Every member of the caucus is entitled to nominate. Every member of the caucus is entitled to vote. And as you know, our prime minister is a bit of a traditionalist, both within the party itself, but also in the way in which our society operates.”The new ministry is expected to be sworn in on Tuesday.Former Labor prime minister Paul Keating this week savaged Albanese and “factional lightweights” within the party over Dreyfus and Husic’s treatment, calling the decision unfair and disrespectful.Keating, who has emerged as a persistent critic of the Albanese government, accused the prime minister of bad judgment over his refusal to save the two ministers.“[It’s] a showing of poor judgment, unfairness and diminished respect for the contribution of others,” he said in a statement.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/09/crowdstrike-to-cut-jobs-and-use-ai",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 08:11",
            "content": "The cybersecurity company that became a household name after causing a massive global IT outage last year has announced it will cut 5% of its workforce in part due to “AI efficiency”.In a note to staff earlier this week, released in stock market filings in the US, CrowdStrike’s chief executive, George Kurtz, announced that 500 positions, or 5% of its workforce, would be cut globally, citing AI efficiencies created in the business.“We’re operating in a market and technology inflection point, with AI reshaping every industry, accelerating threats, and evolving customer needs,” he said.Kurtz said AI “flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster”, adding it “drives efficiencies across both the front and back office”.“AI is a force multiplier throughout the business,” he said.Other reasons for the cuts included market demand for sustained growth and expanding the product offering.The company expects to incur up to US$53m in costs as a result of the job cuts.CrowdStrike reported in March revenue of US$1bn for the fourth financial quarter of 2025, up 25% on the same quarter in 2024, with a loss of US$92m.In July last year, CrowdStrike pushed out a faulty update to its software designed to detect cybersecurity threats that brought down 8.5m Windows systems worldwide.The outage caused chaos at airports, and took down computers in hospitals, TV networks, payment systems and people’s personal computers.Aaron McEwan, vice-president of research and advisory at consultancy Gartner, said he was sceptical when companies announced AI efficiencies close to reduced revenue forecasts, as CrowdStrike had in March.“I think particularly in the tech sector … it’s a way of justifying a reduction in the workforce because [of] a financial issue,” he said. “So either they’re not tracking well financially, or they’re trying to send a message to investors that good times are around the corner. So I’m immediately sceptical.”McEwan said companies were facing pressure to deliver on the big investments made in AI.“The productivity gains that we expect to see from AI just aren’t flowing through.”Gartner research showed across workforces less than 50% of employees are using AI in their job, and only 8% of employees are using AI tools to improve productivity.Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales, said CrowdStrike’s announcement was “pretty tone deaf” after the outage last year.“They would have been better redeploying this 5% of people to emergency response and bug fixing,” he said.Walsh said the market should expect more of these announcements in future.“It’s pretty simple: more profits for companies, less work for workers. But we should learn from the first Industrial Revolution. If we stand up in solidarity, we can use these savings to improve quality and quantity of work for all.”Niusha Shafiabady, associate professor in computational intelligence at the Australian Catholic University, said AI job replacements were an “unavoidable reality”.“No matter what we believe is moral and right, this change will happen. Unfortunately, a lot of people will lose their traditional jobs to AI and technology,” she said.“If [companies] see that they are saving money by using AI and technology and enhancing their services, they will ask their employees to leave. This is the reality.”A World Economic Forum report in 2023 found nearly 23% of all jobs globally will change in the next five years due to AI and other macroeconomic trends. While 69m jobs are expected to be created, 83m jobs could be eliminated, leading to a net decrease of 2%, Shafiabady said.McEwan said companies – tech companies in particular – would be looking for ways to use AI to reduce workforces over time.“I have no doubt that there will be the emergence of companies that are able to reduce their workforce and substantially because of AI,” he said.“It’ll depend on the type of product that they’re selling. But at the moment most companies would be wise to look at how they can use AI to augment their workforce rather than replace.”Has your job been lost to AI?

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/09/pope-leo-xiv-lgbtq",
            "published_at": "2025-05-9 08:00",
            "content": "After years of sympathetic and inclusive comments from Pope Francis, LGBTQ+ Catholics expressed concern on Thursday about hostile remarks made more than a decade ago by Father Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV, in which he condemned what he called the “homosexual lifestyle” and “the redefinition of marriage” as “at odds with the Gospel”.In a 2012 address to the world synod of bishops, the man who now leads the church said that “Western mass media is extraordinarily effective in fostering within the general public enormous sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the Gospel – for example abortion, homosexual lifestyle, euthanasia”.In the remarks, of which he also read portions for a video produced by the Catholic News Service, a news agency owned by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the cleric blamed mass media for fostering so much “sympathy for anti-Christian lifestyles choices” that “when people hear the Christian message it often inevitably seems ideological and emotionally cruel”.“Catholic pastors who preach against the legalization of abortion or the redefinition of marriage are portrayed as being ideologically driven, severe and uncaring,” Prevost added.He went on to complain that “alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children are so benignly and sympathetically portrayed in television programs and cinema today”.The video illustrated his criticism of the “homosexual lifestyle” and “same-sex partners and their adopted children” with clips from two US sitcoms featuring same-sex couples, The New Normal and Modern Family.The cleric also called for a “new evangelization to counter these mass media-produced distortions of religious and ethical reality”.After some of the comments were reported by the New York Times, American LGBTQ+ Catholic groups expressed alarm but also cautious optimism that the papacy of Francis had moved the whole church forward.“We pray that in the 13 years that have passed, 12 of which were under the papacy of Pope Francis, that his heart and mind have developed more progressively on LGBTQ+ issues, and we will take a wait-and-see attitude to see if that has happened,” said Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Maryland-based LGBTQ+ Catholic group, in a statement. “We pray that as our church transitions from 12 years of an historic papacy, Pope Leo XIV will continue the welcome and outreach to LGBTQ+ people which Pope Francis inaugurated.”DignityUSA, a group that represents LGBTQ+ Catholics, also expressed “concern” with the pope’s previous comments but wrote in an online post: “We note that this statement was made during the papacy of Benedict XVI, when doctrinal adherence appeared to be expected. In addition, the voices of LGBTQ+ people were rarely heard at that level of church leadership. We pray that Pope Leo XIV will demonstrate a willingness to listen and grow as he begins his new role as the leader of the global church.”Perhaps the best-known of the sympathetic statements made about LGBTQ+ Catholics by Pope Francis was a comment he made to reporters in 2013, when he was asked about his observation that there was a “gay lobby” inside the Vatican hierarchy.“I have yet to find someone who introduces himself at the Vatican with an identity card marked ‘gay’,” the pope joked. “But we must distinguish the fact that a person is gay from the fact of lobbying, because no lobbies are good.“If a person is gay,” he added, “and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?”DeBernardo, the New Ways Ministry director, referenced those remarks on Thursday.Sign up to Headlines USGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningafter newsletter promotion“The healing that began with ‘Who am I to judge?’ needs to continue and grow to ‘Who am I, if not a friend to LGBTQ+ people?’” DeBernardo said.“Pope Francis opened the door to a new approach to LGBTQ+ people; Pope Leo must now guide the church through that door,” he added. “Many Catholics, including bishops and other leaders, remain ignorant about the reality of LGBTQ+ lives, including the marginalization, discrimination and violence that many still face, even in Catholic institutions. We hope that he will further educate himself by meeting with and listening to LGBTQ+ Catholics and their supporters.”Marianne Duddy-Burke, the executive director of DignityUSA, told the Washington Blade in a text message from St Peter’s Square shortly after Leo XIV’s election that the new pope “hasn’t said a lot since early 2010s” on the subject, adding “hope he has evolved”.Father James Martin, an American Jesuit and the founder of Outreach, an LGBTQ+ Catholic resource, sounded a note of optimism in a video message from Rome, calling the new pope a “down-to-earth, kind, modest” man and “a great choice”.In 2023, Martin was able to bless a same-sex couple for the first time, after Pope Francis said he would allow such blessings.In 2020, Pope Francis said that he supported civil-union laws for same-sex couples. “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it,” he said.“Pope Francis did more for LGBTQ people than all his predecessors combined,” Martin wrote last month. “He wrote letters of welcome to Outreach conferences for LGBTQ Catholics. He approved the publication of Fiducia Supplicans, a Vatican document that permitted priests to bless same-sex marriages under certain circumstances – and weathered intense blowback from some parts of the church. And, perhaps most surprisingly and least well known, he met regularly with transgender Catholics and spoke to them with warmth and welcome.”",

            "content": "Before she was getting DMs from Dua Lipa and minting K-pop hits, and long before yesterday’s surprise release of her sumptuous fourth album, Erika de Casier was a nervous student in her 20s debating what to wear on her first day.It was 2019, her debut album Essentials had come out that year and received critical acclaim. But at Copenhagen’s Rhythmic Music Conservatory (RMC), that was by the by. “In Denmark, it’s incorporated in our way of being: everybody is so humble,” says the Portuguese musician. “It wasn’t like I went to school and people were like …” She makes an exaggerated starstruck face. “That would be crazy. It was just, ‘Oh, congrats. I heard the new album. Sounds great.’”She wasn’t especially confident about making friends, either. “I was a little afraid that I would become the quiet girl in the corner.”Her shyness evaporated the moment her class began sharing music, discussing the songs they had made in peer-review sessions known as “Kua”, short for kunstnerisk udviklingsarbejde – artistic development. At her graduation concert two years later, De Casier performed as a proper pop star would, playing five new songs to her adoring friends and changing her outfit for each one.“I was entertained all the way through,” says fellow musician Molina, making her friend blush with gratitude as we sit in their shared studio in the north of the Danish capital.De Casier and Molina, from Chile, are two of many noteworthy young musicians to emerge from the RMC in recent years: the school has produced so many brilliant, predominantly female stars, playing a very particular kind of emotionally rich, leftfield electronic pop, that it’s become an engine room for some of Europe’s most exciting music. Among the class of 2020 alone are Henriette Motzfeldt, half of Norwegian two-piece Smerz, and Scotland-born, Denmark-raised Clarissa Connelly, who released a stunning album on Warp last year. The year before them produced the Danes Astrid Sonne and ML Buch, whose own recent LPs became instant classics, much adored by experimental music fans. Denmark’s Fine Glindvad graduated from a master’s course in 2023 and released Rocky Top Ballads, her gorgeous solo debut, last year.These artists reference everything from trap to trance to traditional Danish nursery rhymes. They share some stylistic leanings – a predilection for lower-case song titles and record sleeves adorned with blurry photographs and zoomed-in portraits – but there’s also something less tangible binding them together: melodies like lullabies from some half-remembered dream that stick in your head without shouting for attention.A recent article in Dazed celebrated an “undergound Danish dream-pop scene”, likening the artists’ off-kilter music to the floaty, often unintelligible balladry of Mazzy Star and Cocteau Twins. And Spotify recently published Cph+, a playlist featuring a host of burgeoning RMC talent, numerous other Copenhagen artists and, curiously, non-Danish acts such as Oklou (France), Milan W (Belgium) and Chanel Beads (US), suggesting the emergence of a scene and style unbound by geography. Is this a new genre? “It’s a little bit too narrow,” Sonne says. “I feel like that’s what makes it so special: you can kind of see a thread, but we also make quite different music and we come from different musical backgrounds, and that’s being channelled through the music.”In the verdant courtyard in the middle of the RMC campus, Connelly says: “I think we’re all pretty different. But maybe we’re not. Maybe it is a genre and maybe in 20 years we can see it more clearly.”The RMC is located in Holmen, north of Copenhagen’s picturesque Nyhavn district and just across the water from the freetown of Christiania. Henrik Sveidahl, rektor (boss) of the school since 2005, gives me a tour through the canteen, the many studios and practice rooms, a grand performance hall and the “aquarium”, a lovely glass hall bordered by water where students sometimes throw parties.When the weather is right, students swim in the harbour, although it can be risky if the mercury levels get too high, kicked up from the shipwrecks on the seafloor: Holmen was a naval base from 1690 to 1993. De Casier says her favourite lesson at the RMC involved walking around the school grounds with headphones and hypersensitive mics, dropping pebbles into the water and listening intently as they cascaded into the deep.The RMC opened as a jazz school in 1986, but its recent crop of talent owes a lot to the creation of the composition course in 2009 and the introduction of Kua classes. Sveidahl recalls thinking: “To meet the obligation of our name – rhythmic music – we should rethink it all.” They overhauled the application process, removing music theory as a prerequisite and replacing it with what Sveidhal calls “radical diversity”.“Rhythmic music is an umbrella term covering all kinds of expression,” he says, “basically deriving from the cultural meeting between European and African music culture.” To his colleague, Anders Pagels Jensen, rhythmic music is essentially popular music, “anything from Ella Fitzgerald to Scott Walker to Abba to Lydia Lunch to Charli xcx to Ryoji Ikeda and so forth”. Denmark’s jazz community was outraged at the change. “We were on the front page of national papers,” Sveidahl adds. “It was a paradigm shift.”Jensen’s definition may be broad, but it’s underscored by painstaking attention to listening. Connelly describes Jensen – also a successful producer and musician in his own right – as “the best teacher in the world”.“His knowledge of music is insane,” she says. “He can remember a song I played many years ago and play the chords on the piano, in the right key. He’s so good at understanding music technically, but also emotionally, and it’s very moving how he can relate to so many different students’ work.”Everyone I meet is effusive about his classes. It seems mutual: Jensen proudly sends me a playlist of 77 singers, guitarists, pianists, producers, multi-instrumentalists and the odd rapper who have studied composition with him. Another key sometime-teacher is Nis Bysted, boss of local record label Escho, who has released albums by Sonne, Smerz, Fine and Molina.With 200 places available at the school each year (and only eight on the undergraduate composition course), “only the very talented” gain a place, its website explains. It’s free to attend for anyone in the EU – funded by high Danish tax rates – and students can get a small allowance from the government to cover their cost of living. A redirection of funds from Denmark’s coalition government has tightened the purse strings at the RMC in recent years, but everyone here remains resolutely positive about the school’s future.In a bathroom, I find the words “DEATH IS CERTAIN LIFE IS NOT” daubed on a wall behind a toilet. And in a studio room tucked behind one of the RMC’s impressive concert halls, Sveidhal and I stumble on a student fine-tuning a new album, which he will submit as his master’s project. “It’s a privilege studying here,” he says, “quite unique.” He releases music under the name GB and has a new record coming out on the UK label Untitled Records: a tangle of undulant drones, dreamy choruses and fiddly guitar. Unsurprisingly, it’s excellent.I return the next day with Connelly, plus Smerz’s Motzfeldt and Catharina Stoltenberg, who are close friends. In her first week at the school, Motzfeldt was losing patience with the cycle to campus because her bike chain was leaving oil stains on her trousers. Then she noticed her classmate Connelly, whose trousers were also covered in oil. “She was like, ‘Yes, it doesn’t matter,’” Motzfeldt says. “I remember thinking she was really inspiring.”Stoltenberg didn’t actually study here (she did a maths PhD), but she’s visited many times to teach, practice and record. They take me to room U101, a plush studio equipped – like almost every studio here – with a grand piano, drum kit, recording equipment and a view of passing cyclists.During the pandemic, when lessons moved on to video calls and socialising was only permitted in groups of six, many of these artists met up and did “a lot of karaoke”, says De Casier. She sang Jóga by Björk. Motzfeldt sang Britney. Molina did Madonna. Connelly did Alanis Morissette. Since graduating, many of them have continued meeting to discuss their music in the style of the RMC’s Kua sessions.The idea that any of these talents could one day be as big as Madonna or Britney is anathema to their being, contradicting janteloven, 10 social laws written satirically in 1923 by the Danish Norwegian novelist Aksel Sandemose. Forbidding sins such as bragging and seeking attention, these principles have become key to Danish culture.But pop’s upper echelons are starting to take note: Dua Lipa mentioned De Casier on Instagram in 2019, prompting a remix in 2020, while K-pop sensations NewJeans recruited De Casier, Glindvad and Smerz as songwriters on their 2023 EP Get Up (featuring the hit single Super Shy). “Every bone in my body wants to … ahhh!” says De Casier, screaming cartoonishly at the thought of becoming a pop star. She has had a taste of the experience. A few years after her graduation concert she played a show in London. She was standing outside the venue afterwards when an excited fan approached her, starstruck and struggling to believe it was really her. “I was like ‘This is a misunderstanding!’ I’m just me!’” says De Casier. “I liked it. I just was surprised.”Either way, leftfield music such as theirs doesn’t need validation from the mainstream to be seen as significant. It’s hard to think of another institution in recent memory that has produced so many exciting artists at once: this RMC cohort joins the Rhode Institute School of Design and Mills, Bennington and Black Mountain in the annals of influential academies. Maybe the next generation of experimental breakout stars is at work on their final projects at RMC; maybe not. It depends who’s in your year. “It’s the students who are making this place,” says Sveidahl. Erika De Casier’s album Lifetime is out now on Independent Jeep Music. Smerz’s album Big City Life is released 23 May on Escho. Clarissa Connelly plays Barbican, London, 14 June. Astrid Sonne plays We Out Here festival, Huntingdon, 15 August, and Rally festival, London, 23 August.",

            "content": "The thanksgiving service for the Tory grandee Michael Ancram last week resembled the funeral of his party. Amid an array of traditional Conservatives such as John Major and a multitude of that old ilk, one observer tells me there was no sign of the current shadow cabinet: they belong to a different party altogether. After their lowest vote ever last week, is it all over?A sign of life stirs among the embers. All is not quite lost, if the silenced cohort of moderates listen to the likes of a new party member. David Gauke has rejoined the Conservative party, where he was justice secretary before being ejected for rebelling against Boris Johnson’s threatened “no deal” Brexit. He wasn’t sure the party would take him back, he was ready to write about his second rejection, but the computer said yes. He’s back to fight and fight again to save his party from its rightward march into Faragism.A phalanx of those expelled and those who walked, along with some quiet Tory MPs in parliament, see the glimmer of a chance of creating a renewed party with values they call core conservatism. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general and also expelled by Johnson in 2019, is another appalled at the galloping campaign by Robert Jenrick to lead the party into the heart of the far right: Jenrick was caught by Sky revealing his “unite the right” plan to merge one way or another with Nigel Farage.“This is not my party,” says Grieve, who has not reapplied for membership. “The party used to note populist sentiment as a problem but never inflamed it or echoed its vitriol. Jenrick runs a campaign that is racist: there’s no other way to describe it, demonising immigrants as rapists and knife-killers who free-load on us. It’s utterly reprehensible, stoking emotions that cause riots, exactly as Farage does.”He points with disgust to Jenrick’s stream of immigrant hatred posted on X: “Foreign criminals dodge deportation. Illegal migrants get to stay.” Here’s pure Trumpism: “Equality, Diversity and Inclusion has become a Trojan horse for anti-white discrimination. It’s created identity-based recruitment, where opportunities are offered on the colour of someone’s skin, not the content of their character. This state-sanctioned racism must end.” This former justice secretary issues Trumpian threats to the judiciary: “The simplest solution is to remove judges with a record of activism.” All that, says Grieve, “is the hallmark of the new Conservative party”.Other moderate Tories, sources say, will not speak publicly now, but about 20 MPs could join resistance to a Jenrick demarche: no names for fear of deselection. Justine Greening on these pages spelled out the party’s “dead parrot” state, scoring a lowest-ever 15% in local elections, a majority only among the over-70s. But she didn’t quite have a recipe or a route to restoration. What would it take? A breathtaking turn.Public contrition is essential “to distance us from Johnson and Liz Truss, acknowledging her effect on the economy”, says Gauke. But here’s the big one: repenting of Brexit, confessing it was a serious error; not necessarily advocating an instant rejoin, but rapidly repairing EU relations. That could summon back 4 million Tory remainers who, they say, fled post-referendum. Who could do that? Their best hope is for the affable and essentially moderate James Cleverly to step forward as an erstwhile Brexiter to tell the truth about how badly Brexit turned out, a stunning move to define these new/old Conservatives.The other essential shift, they say, is electoral reform, the only way to split from Jenrickism, allowing alternative opinions on the right and scuppering Jenrick’s far-right bloc. “First-past-the-post no longer fits five-party voting,” Gauke and other rebels say, quite rightly. Here Labour MPs need to sit up and listen: their party, which backed electoral reform at its conference, needs it urgently to defend the country against the far-right risk.Labour people might chortle with glee at Tory disintegration. But in the fight against the extreme right, Tory moderates are needed to take on Faragism. Without them, the country has no moderate alternative to the right of Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and others, risking calamity if Labour is unpopular in 2029. Labour’s win of 63% of seats on 34% of votes could be mirrored by Farage/Jenrickites. Look at Kent last week, where Reform won 70% of seats on just 37% of the vote, or Exeter where Labour topped the poll but won not a single seat.Naturally these new/old Conservatives have no appeal to social democrats, after all – these Tories are absolutely conservative. Talking to them for this column, their model is as follows: they are socially liberal, downplaying culture wars, but think woke went far too far. These Heseltinian Tories are strong on defence and strong on building regeneration, such as the former deputy prime minister’s development corporations. Strongly pro-business, one tells me: “No more ignoring productive finance in the south in favour of loss-making steelworkers in Scunthorpe.” They are pro-free market and want “to expose Farage’s sloppy thinking, especially on nationalisation, too far from Thatcherism.” They want public service efficiency, saying Labour is in the pockets of unions, on the side of producers, not consumers and some questioning the long-term viability of the welfare state. They challenge Liberal Democrats’ “unrealistic” policies: “they’re only a protest party”, another says. Divided on slowing net zero, united on “we’d burnish educational excellence and opportunity”. A “pro-enterprise” tax system would repeal non-dom taxes that expel the rich. Lower taxes and spending are at their core, but pragmatically, only when possible. Defence bonds would raise funds.The sell is a “sensible party” reclaiming the “affluent, educated aspirational middle classes”, while appealing to traditional working-class Tories with respect for heritage, institutions of the state, monarchy and parliament. No soap-box grandstanding but a grown-up political tone. No more awful ya-boo Tory press releases several times a day, many with utterly mendacious attacks on Labour: they would restore some political dignity, backing the government when it’s right, attacking selectively on key matters.It’s a hard task. Prof Tim Bale, aficionado on the Tories, warns that the Lib Dems are now firmly rooted in southern Tory turf. He points out with brutal realism that voters divided on left/right, liberal/reactionary axes cluster thinly in this one nation quadrant of socially liberal but economically dry: probably 20% of voters. But in these fractured days, 20% would see off the hard right. However, all this is unicorn and rainbow talk, unless Labour uses these next four years for electoral reform. If they refuse, they had better be 100% sure it won’t gift power to an unspeakable Farage/Jenrick alliance.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

            "content": "The Liberal leadership race is firming as a contest between the deputy leader, Sussan Ley, and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, after Dan Tehan ruled himself out.Ley announced on Friday that she would run for the party’s leadership, to be decided at a vote on Tuesday.Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, meanwhile, defended her decision to defect from the Nationals to the Liberal party room, saying she had consulted with colleagues before the move.Nationals have criticised the defection, with their party’s leader, David Littleproud, saying he was “disappointed”. Senator Matt Canavan said Price’s “decision to put her own ambition over the will of the voters is exactly why people are sick of politicians”, and confirmed on Friday afternoon that he will challenge David Littleproud for the leadership of the National party.Price told 2GB radio on Friday that she had forewarned colleagues, including Canavan.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“I wanted to do it in a respectful way,” she said. “So I did speak to my colleagues. I even spoke to Sussan Ley as well. So there are many that I had spoken to in the lead-up to this being announced.”Canavan told The Australian newspaper the Coalition should scrap Australia’s goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, saying the plan should be “on how we can save the country, not save the party”.“I am standing for my party’s leadership so that I can tell my kids I did everything I could to fight for a better life for them,” the Queensland senator said.As a Country Liberal party senator from the Northern Territory, Price is allowed to sit with either the Liberals or the Nationals.She suggested she had always wanted to sit in the Liberal party room but had been “expected” to sit with the Nationals.“To be quite honest, it is something that I wanted to do from the first time I was elected,” she told 2GB.“[But I] chose at that time that I needed to sit in the National party room, which was the expectation … and serve the people of the Northern Territory from there.”It has been speculated that Price could join Taylor’s ticket for the Liberal leadership as his deputy, although the CLP senator remained coy on Friday. “This is a huge step that I have undertaken at this point,” she said.Price has faced some blame for the Liberal party’s catastrophic loss on Saturday after she told reporters during the campaign the Coalition would “make Australia great again”.Images emerged of the senator wearing a Maga hat at a Christmas party, which she brushed off as a “joke”.Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotionOn Thursday, moderate Liberals ridiculed her decision to defect. They said a leadership ticket with Taylor and Price risked “taking us further from the centre”.Price has previously been criticised by some Indigenous leaders for her role in helping to defeat the voice to parliament referendum.On her defection, the senior Aboriginal leader Marcus Stewart said: “If Jacinta Price is the answer, then clearly the Liberals don’t understand the question.”The Liberal leadership battle was solidifying on Friday with Ley and Taylor formally in the race.Taylor told the Australian Financial Review on Thursday he would run for the leadership and heralded Price’s move as an “extraordinary addition” to the party.On Friday, Ley told Sunrise the Liberals had let Australian women down.“I’m determined and convinced that I am the right person to lead the party forward at this time, and I think my appointment would send a strong signal to the women of Australia, but it’s about much more than that,” Ley said.“It is about the policy offering. It is about what modern Australia expects of us as Liberals.”Tehan, who had been considered a likely contender, ruled himself out of the race on Friday. The former Coalition government minister and shadow immigration minister said the party needed to take an “honest look at the 2025 election, our history and the future”.“I love the Liberal party, and I want to help reconnect us with the Australian people, but after careful consideration and conversations with my colleagues, I have decided not to stand for a leadership position,” he said.“I will work hard and serve in whatever capacity I am asked to rebuild our party.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 07:30",
            "content": "“Yes, this is true,” says Mohammad Abbas, matter-of-factly, during a chat at Trent Bridge. The question concerns the time Manchester City supposedly asked for Pep Guardiola to be billeted in the penthouse at Hampshire’s on-site hotel before a match in Southampton – only to be told a more important guest was in town.“I didn’t know about it at the time but our head coach told me the next morning that he had wanted my room,” Abbas says of Guardiola. “The Hilton emailed the Hampshire management to ask if it was possible but they were told no, I would be spending six months there. So that was what happened.”It is a cool story and, in fairness, Abbas did plenty to deserve VIP status at the club. Over the course of four seasons he took 180 wickets at 19.26 runs apiece, which, following 79 at a similar average for Leicestershire, cemented his claim to be one of – if not the – leading exponents of seam-up in the County Championship. Abbas in full flow is a bit like a Guardiola team: Swiss clock accuracy allied with Swiss army knife skills.The numbers and the excellence of execution made Hampshire’s decision to release Abbas last winter a surprise, with Nottinghamshire – his intended destination in 2020 before Covid intervened – quick to snap up the 35-year-old on a six-match deal. This prompted speculation on whether Hampshire’s new owners, India’s GMR Group, did not want a Pakistani cricketer on their books but Abbas is having none of it.“No, that’s not why,” says Abbas, fresh from giving Haseeb Hameed, his new captain, a workout in the nets before his first outing against his former employers. “James Vince had stopped playing four-day cricket and they said they needed a batter for an overseas player; so a bit of a restructure. We had good communication around it and they are good people. Still they are messaging me and I am messaging them. They are fantastic.”We could go deeper on India-Pakistan cricket relations in a week when the fallout from the Pahalgam terrorist attack has escalated dramatically. But it is a highly sensitive topic and Abbas, it soon transpires after a question about having not played since March, is still coping with tragic news of his own back home.“The last three months have been very hard for my family,” he says. “Both my brother and sister passed away, so I took a break. My sister was married last June and passed because of [complications with her] pregnancy. My brother was a kidney patient for the past year. We had a plan for his transplant but he passed away just before Eid.”Abbas says his family’s pain is starting to settle and he wants to be professional for his new team. Playing in the East Midlands, with its large Pakistani community, is another source of comfort, while there is also a joke that staying in Pakistan much longer would not have been good for his fitness. “Too much fatty food,” he says with a smile. “When you go to meet your relatives, they are just inviting you to eat these things.”Though into his mid-30s, Abbas is a remarkably lithe and durable bowler, such that he is laser focused on playing for a good while yet. Given his county exploits and eight wickets to set up a memorable Test win at Lord’s in 2018, Pakistan’s series in England next summer is, unsurprisingly, a target.Abbas, though, pushes back at the notion of being a Dukes ball or even red-ball specialist, insisting he is a bowler for all surfaces, all formats. Here he begins reeling off his own figures to back it up, bringing to mind another meticulous overseas pro for Nottinghamshire, Sir Richard Hadlee.First come his 775 first-class wickets at just a tick over 20, before a reminder of the challenging surfaces at home on which more than half off those have come. Then comes the Test bowling average of 23.18 that, of the 20 Pakistanis to take 100 or more Test wickets, is second only to Imran Khan. “I am always fighting myself,” he says, when asked about his motivations. “I’m always trying to beat my career best things.”The question here is why Abbas, on exactly 100 Test wickets and a domestic great, has not won more than his 27 caps. “It is hard, as a human being,” he says. “But unfortunately our management, coaches and captains change every six months or year. I don’t know about the mindset of these guys but maybe they wanted to give a chance to youngsters. Also, we do not play enough Test matches. That is the main problem.”Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotionAnother factor in recent times is the surfaces Pakistan have been preparing for Test cricket, with their 2-1 series victory against England last October achieved via bespoke rank turners on which the spinners Sajid Khan and Noman Ali shared 39 wickets in two outings. After a three-year hiatus, Abbas returned to play the two Tests in South Africa that followed, nipping out 10 wickets with the Kookaburra ball and showing remarkable endurance, only to be overlooked at home to West Indies three weeks later.“Most teams are looking for home advantage,” Abbas says. “But I think this [approach] is not good for the future of fast bowling in Pakistan. I think the coaching staff is going to change again soon. I don’t know what they have planned for the next year.”Another suspicion is that pace has been a factor, with Abbas typically operating in the low 80s on the speed gun and chiefly outskilling his opponents. It brings us on to the subject of Sam Cook, a similar medium-fast “nip” bowler who is poised to make his England debut this month and buck something of a trend towards the quicker men.Abbas says: “My advice is just to bowl the same as he does in county cricket, to stay calm, keep to his basics and confidence will grow. The most important thing is to know who you are as a bowler and not try to be something you are not.”Coming from a bowler so celebrated he once denied Manchester City’s manager a penthouse suite, it feels like a pep talk worth listening to.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/09/farrells-lions-squad-has-the-flexibility-and-talent-for-an-epic-adventure",
            "content": "At long last, significant smoke has also emerged from the British & Irish Lions’ chimney. Maro Itoje will be leading a 38-strong squad to Australia and a couple of the names on the list would raise any cardinal’s eyebrows. Henry Pollock and Marcus Smith will be heading down under with their head coach, Andy Farrell, clearly keen to make an immediate impact next month.Farrell has chosen a hefty cohort of 15 Irishmen alongside 13 Englishmen, eight Scots and two Welsh representatives, but the inclusion of the 20-year-old Pollock sends a clear signal to Australia that the 2025 Lions will be neither geriatric pussycats nor obsessive slaves to conservatism. The squad should contain enough flexibility to cope with most eventualities and sufficient talent to be highly competitive.They are not, however, the most experienced pride of Lions selected. Farrell has left behind a bucketload of Test caps, with Jamie George, Courtney Lawes, Taulupe Faletau and, last but not least, his son Owen all missing out. Farrell Sr has played and watched enough rugby in Australia in his time to know that, sporting-wise, it tends to be no country for too many old men, particularly with the modern game growing faster by the week.In many ways it is refreshing although, equally, a Lions tour is no place for diffident ingenues. Even those who went on the last, Covid-affected, tour to South Africa in 2021 did not have to contend with rabid home crowds and endless Lions punters wanting selfies and autographs. But Farrell is clearly confident Pollock and his Northampton teammate Fin Smith, among others, are made of the right stuff. “If you’re good enough, you’re old enough,” said Farrell, who has seen enough of Pollock to know he simply had to tour. “I like what I see.”More youthful players than Pollock have become Lions in the past – Louis Rees-Zammit was a few days younger last time around – but what really counts is the speed at which all the disparate parts start purring in unison. Farrell has been merciful towards one or two Leinster representatives, 12 of whom have been included despite their disappointing defeat in last Saturday’s Champions Cup semi‑final against Northampton, but will now expect them all to repay him big time on tour.There are other discernible themes, all of them either pragmatic or quietly astute. Aside from one exception – Toulouse’s Blair Kinghorn – Farrell has resisted the chance to draw on the expat talent available in the Top 14, which has counted against Jack Willis, Ben White, David Ribbans and others. In one or two instances, too, he has favoured mood enhancers who will keep the squad buoyant. Connacht’s Mack Hansen, picked ahead of Edinburgh’s unlucky Darcy Graham, is one and Sale’s Luke Cowan-Dickie another.That may not be the main takeaway in Wales, with Jac Morgan and Tomos Williams comprising the smallest Welsh contingent since the second world war. But, with the final selection meeting having stretched into an eighth hour, plenty of other contenders from the four home nations have also had their hopes dashed, from Scotland’s versatile Tom Jordan to the in-form George Ford. The heart also bleeds for the luckless Caelan Doris, injured at the worst possible moment last Saturday.On the flipside Marcus Smith will be ecstatic, having endured a dispiriting season for the most part. He owes his selection primarily to his ability to play at full-back and, potentially, to add dash off the bench in big games. Ditto, potentially, Elliot Daly. Equally thrilled will be Glasgow’s Scott Cummings, who has been picked to add some ballast to the pack.It is also certain that others will be whistled up to fill gaps later in the tour, by which time Manny Feyi-Waboso, for one, should be fit again. And who would not want to be part of this Lions campaign? The team will once again be roared on by their travelling “sea of red”, with hopes of a record attendance of 100,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the second Test in late July.Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionNagging doubts? A few, particularly with Australia under shrewd management and Doris’s injury reducing the options at No 8, where Jack Conan and Ben Earl are theoretically the main men, with Tom Curry and Pollock in support. Much could yet depend on the goal-kicking accuracy of Finn Russell and Fin Smith, another reason why Johnny Sexton’s presence on the coaching ticket will be fascinating.Hopefully, the next time they put on a live announcement show it will take less time to cut to the chase. At times the endless preamble made you pine for the days of old-school letters dropping on doormats. Part of the Lions’ appeal is their mystique and rich heritage, neither of which is necessarily accentuated in the depths of the O2 on a Thursday afternoon with Giving Me, by Jazzy, playing over the public address system.You still cannot beat a Lions expedition, though, once it actually commences. The suspense, the rivalry, the passion: and that’s just the first training session. “I want us to play with passion and energy and the zeal you would expect of a Lions squad,” said the newly ordained Itoje. Every Lions tour is an epic adventure and this one should be no exception.",

            "content": "The Four Nations Chess League (4NCL) is a bedrock of British chess. Staged over 11 rounds and five weekends from October to May at Midlands hotels, with teams of eight in the top division and six in divisions two to four, it attracts players from club level to grandmaster, many of whom do not compete in any other national event. Its organisation, by the English Chess Federation chief executive, Mike Truran, and a hardworking team of arbiters, is consistently excellent.As expected, the 2024-25 season ended last Monday with a close 11th round match between the favourites and defending champions, Wood Green, and the winners for the two previous years, Manx Liberty. The outcome was a rarity. All eight games were drawn for a 4-4 scoreline, although most were hard fought and Manx missed a winning endgame chance.Contrary to predictions, the title was already decided in the previous round when The Sharks, who had tied 4-4 with Manx in round nine, defeated Wood Green 4.5-3.5.Final leading scores were Manx Liberty 20/22 match points, Wood Green 17, Wood Green Youth 16, Chessable White Rose 16, Cheddleton Savills Catering 13, The Sharks 13, CSC/Kingston 11.In previous seasons the top teams often brought in a world-class wildcard for the final weekend. This time Wood Green added the eight-time British champion Michael Adams, who duly delivered one of the best games of the weekend in round 10, complete with bishop and knight sacrifices, but was held to draws in the crunch matches of rounds nine and 11.Manx, who in their previous winning seasons had brought in the Fire on Board author, Alexei Shirov, for the decisive rounds, opted instead for a different approach, signing up the 2022 British champion, Harry Grieve, and England’s youngest grandmaster, Shreyas Royal, for the whole season to supplement their core squad of Romanian, Hungarian and Polish GMs and IMs.It worked brilliantly. Grieve, with 9.5/11, amassed the highest points total of any player in the top division, while Royal’s 8/11 included a streak of six consecutive wins. The outcome should encourage Grieve, 24, to make a renewed push for his third and final GM norm, while Royal is now consistently producing 2500-rated performances. Grieve won in style in this game.The human story of the weekend was Richard Pert scoring his second GM norm at age 44, 19 years after his first norm which was also achieved in the 4NCL, watched by his twin brother, Nick, his son Max and his daughter Nina, who all played in the same Cheddleton Savills Catering team on Sunday. Victory was no easy matter, for his opponent needed a win for his own IM norm. The Pert family celebrations continued on Monday when Nina, 16, checkmated an international master.Additionally to Richard Pert, Tom O’Gorman of The Sharks and Ireland scored his first GM norm, Zoe Varney of Blackthorne and England her second WIM norm, and Svyatoslav Bazakutsa of Wood Green and Ukraine his second GM norm.The 4NCL has an important role in developing young British talent. England’s star junior of the moment is Supratit Banerjee, 11, of Coulsdon, Surrey, who plays for the CSC/Kingston 4NCL team. Banerjee’s Fide rating has surged impressively this year, rising over 170 points in four months to his current 2312 Fide Master level. In that period he has played more than 100 games, with tournaments in Spain and Hungary as well as in England.Sign up to The RecapThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionafter newsletter promotionAt 11 years and two months, Banerjee has a serious chance to surpass the UK record of Luke McShane and David Howell, who became international masters at 13 years and two months in 1997 and 2004 respectively. Royal did it at 13 years and seven months and Nigel Short at 14years and six months, while Freddy Waldhausen Gordon, at 14 possibly Scotland’s best ever talent, now has the required three norms and 2400 rating and expects his IM title to be ratified at the next Fide council meeting.It is not a done deal for Banerjee, as some talents hit a ceiling above 2300 but miss out on the higher level. He scored 6.5/11 for CSC/Kingston in the 4NCL season including this round seven win, but there was a warning sign in the final round when his gung-ho attack led to defeat. One of Banerjee’s coming norm opportunities will be at the Kingston Invitational in August, organised by the Guardian’s Stephen Moss.At international level, the boy to watch is Roman Shogdzhiev. The Russian, already world under-eight champion with 11/11 and world under-10 champion with 10/11, achieved his first IM norm last year aged nine, and has just scored his second IM norm at the Baku Open, registering a tournament performance of over 2500. Shogdzhiev is now on track to break the record of Argentina’s “chess Messi” Faustino Oro as the youngest ever international master.The Garry Kasparov of the 21st century? In 1975, this column forecast that the then unknown 11-year-old Garik Weinstein (later Kasparov) would succeed Anatoly Karpov as world champion by 1990. Now, Shogdzhiev looks the part as the player to restore Russia’s lost chess glories in the next decade.3971: 1 Qxh6+! Kxh6 (if gxh6 2 Rxh8 mate) 2 Rxh8+ Kg5 3 Rh5 mate.",

            "content": "“When he is fit, he is one of the best midfielders,” enthused Enzo Maresca after Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Everton a few weeks ago. His team had laboured to a narrow home win but the manager was full of praise for his young midfielder. Chelsea have paid huge transfer fees for midfielders in recent years, breaking the British transfer record to sign Enzo Fernández from Benfica for £107m and then upping the record to bring in Moisés Caicedo from Brighton, but Maresca knows his team is at its best when Roméo Lavia is available.Fernández and Caicedo have performed superbly in recent weeks as Chelsea have chased down a place in the Champions League. The Ecuadorian has done particularly well at right-back, having been moved out of midfield to accommodate Lavia in the starting XI. Caicedo has dropped into defence and operated as an inverted right-back, doing so to a better standard than both Reece James and Malo Gusto.Given his hefty transfer fee and ability to win back the ball in the centre of the park, Caicedo probably expected to be one of the first names on the team sheet, but his new position in the team shows just how valuable Lavia is to Chelsea. Maresca has picked the former Southampton man alongside Fernández at the base of his 4-2-3-1 formation because he gives the team greater balance.Lavia has the best pass success rate in the Chelsea squad (91.8%) this season in the league. He completed 100% of his passes against Liverpool at the weekend – as he had done against Tottenham last month (before he was forced off with an injury). The 21-year-old really caught the eye in the 3-1 victory against Liverpool.Having already clinched the title, there was not much at stake for Arne Slot’s men at Stamford Bridge but, even so, Lavia gave a performance that warranted adulation. To not misplace any of his 23 passes against the best side in the land is a tremendous feat. Cole Palmer made most of the headlines by scoring his first goal in 18 games but Lavia was the player who dictated the tempo for Chelsea.Chelsea fans must be delighted by his form given he had such an arduous start at the club. The Belgium international was restricted to just 32 minutes of league action in his debut campaign for the club as an ankle problem followed by a hamstring injury denied him the chance to consolidate a starting spot under Mauricio Pochettino.Lavia clearly has the faith of Maresca, who threw him into action on the first day of the season against Manchester City. Further hamstring complaints meant he didn’t start another game until the 2-1 defeat at Liverpool in October, two months after his full Chelsea debut, but Maresca clearly wants to pick the midfielder as soon as he is given the green light to do so. Maresca’s side can get by fine without Lavia but they are a far stronger side when he plays.Not only is Lavia a tidy performer in possession, but his press resistance and close control make him the ideal player to receive the ball from defence and start attacks. He gives away possession as a result of an unsuccessful touch just 0.1 times per 90 minutes; to put that in context, Caicedo does it one time per 90 and Fernández 0.9 times per 90. Rifle the ball into Lavia and he will control with ease – a skill that means Chelsea can build from the back without fear of being caught short in defence. For a Chelsea side that ranks third for possession (57.6%) in the league this season, Lavia is the ideal cog in Maresca’s machine.Yet, the “when he is fit” line from Maresca after the Everton game is telling. Lavia’s start against Liverpool was just his 10th in nearly two years at the club. He has not yet completed a full match in a Chelsea shirt and was left out of their Conference League squad due to fitness issues. When his teammates line up to face Real Betis in the final of the competition in Wroclaw later this month, he will be watching from the stands because his manager could not trust him to be fit.The pros outweigh the cons for Maresca, though. Lavia has proven instrumental in his sporadic outings, none more so than against Liverpool. His availability could be the key to Chelsea securing a top-five finish this season.This is an article by WhoScored",

            "content": "Five years since her Grammy-nominated breakthrough record Miss Colombia, singer and producer Lido Pimienta has taken a radical shift in direction. On Miss Colombia, Pimienta combined sprightly electro pop with cumbia rhythms and soaring vocals to critique racism and misogyny – now, her fourth album La Belleza (The Beauty) is a nine-track orchestral suite touching on everything from Gregorian chant to strings-laden love songs and dembow rhythms.Inspired by Catholic requiem mass music and the luscious harpsichord folk of Czech composer Luboš Fiser’s score to 1970 film Valerie and Her Week of Wonders, Pimienta and producer Owen Pallett began writing and arranging for the 60-piece Medellín Philharmonic Orchestra during the Covid lockdowns. The result is a moving work of remarkable depth.There is drama aplenty. Pimienta harnesses the trilling tension of the Philharmonic’s strings section on the militaristic tone of Ahora, intended as a battle cry for her Indigenous Wayuu roots. Aún Te Quiero employs thrumming counterpoint phrasing in the horn section as Pimienta sings a lament for her past self, and El Dembow del Tiempo ingeniously layers a percussive dembow rhythm over baroque flutes, producing a strangely propulsive new sound.While the instrumentals are deftly arranged and often surprising, it’s Pimienta’s agile, flawless vocals that steal the show: effortlessly doubling the yearning trumpet melodies of requiem mass music on Overturn, performing a sweet, soaring falsetto at the end of Ahora, powerfully leaping through glissandos on the harp-plucking of Mango and layering poignant, full-throated harmonies on closer Busca La Luz. Ascending from whispered intimacy to bellowing force as she yearns for affection on Quiero Que Me Beses (I Want You to Kiss Me), her maturing voice is as captivating as the might of any orchestra.Egyptian producer Elkotsh’s debut album Rhlt Jdi (Nyege Nyege Tapes) combines doom-laden synth bass with celebratory mahraganat rhythms to produce a thunderous new blend. The hammering techno kick drums and siren-like melodies of Mwlid Ala’sar are an infectious highlight. A new compilation of unreleased music from Cameroonian musicologist Francis Bebey, Trésor Magnétique (Africa Seven), is an Afrofuturist treasure trove, blending everything from drum machines with mbira melody to breathy pygmy flutes with synth buzz, confounding genre definitions from the 1970s onwards. Singer Manika Kaur’s latest album Devocean (Six Degrees) is a soothing collection of spiritual music from Arabic, Sikh, Celtic and Indigenous traditions. At times in danger of straying towards wafting New Age ambience, tracks like Māori song Wakan Tanka manage to find poignancy in the blend of Kaur’s gossamer voice with the earthy didgeridoo.",

            "content": "China and Russia pledged to further deepen their already “no limits” partnership in a joint statement published ahead of Russia’s military parade on Friday, as the two sides stressed the importance of maintaining the “correct view” of second world war history.In a lengthy statement published during Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow for the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which Russia celebrates on 9 May as Victory Day, Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said “certain countries … are attempting to tamper with the results of the victory of the second world war”.Xi is on his 11th visit to Russia since becoming president in 2013. On Thursday Xi and Putin held nearly four hours of talks in which both leaders described the other as a close friend. Putin announced plans to visit China in the autumn for the commemoration of Japan’s defeat in the second world war.The Xi-Putin statement went further than previous ones in directly condemning the United States.“The United States and its allies are trying to promote Nato’s eastward expansion into the Asia-Pacific region, build ‘small circles’ in the Asia-Pacific region, and win over countries in the region to promote their ‘Indo-Pacific strategy’, undermining regional peace, stability and prosperity,” the statement read.China has long sympathised with Russia’s argument that Nato expansion in Europe was a threat to its security.The statement also said that “unilateral coercive measures, including economic sanctions, that bypass the UN security council violate the UN Charter and other international laws and undermine international security interests”.China is fighting an escalating trade war with the US that has rocked global markets since US president Donald Trump took office in January. China and the US are due to hold preliminary talks on de-escalating the tariffs this weekend. Meanwhile, Russia is under pressure from the US to pursue peace talks in Ukraine. This week’s meeting of the Chinese and Russian leaders underscores the close relationship between the two men who see themselves as a bulwark against US hegemony.Earlier this week Xi claimed that the second world war also represented the “liberation” of Taiwan and marked “Taiwan’s return to China”. The Chinese Communist party claims Taiwan as part of its territory but it has never ruled over the island. The Republic of China fled there in 1949 after being defeated by the communists in the Chinese civil war. China has vowed to annex the island, by force if necessary, and Xi has made it clear that he sees resolving the “Taiwan problem” as an important part of his legacy.The joint Xi-Putin statement stated that Russia “firmly supports the measures taken by the Chinese government to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve national reunification”.Although China and Russia do not have a normal military alliance, there are growing concerns in the west about the close security cooperation between the two countries. China and Russia conducted 14 joint military exercises in 2024, according to data compiled by the ChinaPower project, which tracks military and economic developments.A Chinese honour guard will participate in Friday’s military parade in Moscow for the first time since 2015.",

            "content": "Perfectly in tune with our current state of low-key but persistent AI panic, this sci-fi comedy stars Alexander Skarsgård as the titular, self-named security cyborg. Skarsgård’s bot has managed to hack itself, but having overridden its programming, it’s unsure of what to do with its freedom. After all, one false move and its semi-autonomous state will be revealed. The tone is wry rather than dystopian. Murderbot has been hired as security by a shambolic gaggle of space-travelling environmentalists – but while it does have the capacity to go on a killing spree, it really just wants to be left alone to watch soap operas and ponder its place in the universe. Dryly funny and existentially intriguing. \n   Apple TV, from Friday 16 MayThere is a nicely tweaked all-American fantasy in this semi-autobiographical comedy, written by and starring Benito Skinner and featuring a soundtrack by Charli xcx. Benny (Skinner) is the handsome jock of small-town dreams. As he heads for college, the world is his oyster. But he’s confused by one thing: he keeps seeing boys he fancies. Soon, he hooks up (platonically) with Wally Baram’s Carmen, their sweet friendship both underpinned and undermined by the sense that neither is quite who they want to be. The pair are plainly too charismatic and easy on the eye to pass as true misfits but they’re good company all the same.\n   Prime Video, from Thursday 15 MayThe Liver King (Brian Johnson to his mum) is one of the more absurd social media presences in recent history. An influencer claiming an “ancestral lifestyle”, his shtick is much as his name suggests: for years he claimed his musculature was the product of an offal-heavy diet of raw meat. This documentary – which hears from adherents to this bizarre regimen and from Johnson himself – explores the truth: in 2022, leaked emails revealed he’d been spending thousands of dollars a month on steroids. Yet another cautionary tale from an era overflowing with them. \n   Netflix, from Tuesday 13 MayThis sketch comedy from Tom Segura lands somewhere between I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson and a slasher film. Segura has described it as “a world where intrusive thoughts win” and that leads to some striking vignettes. It’s a realm in which country singers kidnap their fans and torment them psychologically until they provide lyrical inspiration, and where baristas are punished for their smugness by having their brains splattered on the counters of their coffee shops. The weirdness sometimes feels self-conscious but, still, a potential cult hit. Netflix, from Tuesday 13 MaySign up to What's OnGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every Mondayafter newsletter promotionIs there anything more to be said about the grotesquely horrible case of Fred and Rose West? This documentary series fills in a few gaps, revealing recently discovered police recordings and shockingly visceral first-person testimonies from those unfortunate enough to have jobs requiring them to bear witness to the realities of the Wests’ crimes. It also features relatives of some of the victims, several of whom are speaking on the record for the first time. Whether it amounts to fresh insight or more wallowing in misery is debatable. Netflix, from Wednesday 14 MayWhile Quinta Brunson’s school-set mockumentary has lost a little narrative momentum in recent seasons, it has gained poignancy thanks to the US government’s attacks on publicly funded institutions. These latest episodes wrap up season four (season five is already commissioned). As both the cause and effect of Ava’s suspension, the school’s financial struggles continue to underpin the story. But there are also frequent reminders of why the teachers’ work matters, not least in the sweet season finale in which a play is staged by the students. \n   Disney+, from Wednesday 14 MayThe late 80s “satanic panic” around heavy metal gets the drama treatment in this entertaining series in which a struggling high-school band get a bold idea. A local teen has gone missing and wild rumours are convulsing their small town; so why not go to the dark side? Soon, the band are filling rooms – but not all of the attention they’re receiving is welcome. Worse still, strange things are happening to the band members. Have they accidentally invoked dark forces beyond their control? The dialogue is often clunky but the whole thing feels appropriately cartoonish. \n  Paramount+, from Friday 16 May",

            "content": "To be selected for Granta’s Best of Young British Novelists list two years before your debut novel comes out must bring a certain amount of pressure. Saba Sams had already been named a rising star for her short-story collection, Send Nudes; one of the stories, Blue 4eva, won the 2022 BBC National short story award. Now comes Gunk, titled for the grotty student nightclub managed by the thirtysomething protagonist, Jules. The fried egg on the cover hints at a sleazy edge: expect hangover breakfasts with a dawn chorus soundtrack. It’s also a playful nod to more tender themes of fertility panic, unplanned pregnancy and young motherhood.At the heart of Gunk is a not-quite-love-not-quite-triangle between Jules, her feckless ex-husband Leon, nightclub owner and irredeemable waster, and the young, mysterious nim – that lower case “n” is all part of her vibe. Nim arrives one night at the club and captivates both Jules and Leon with her shaved head, her alluring mouth (“big and wet and laughing”), and the sense that she’s on the run from her old life. Much of the novel is told through flashback. Before we encounter nim at the club, we know that she has had a baby, left him with Jules, and vanished. Jules is alone trying to comfort a newborn that “knew by smell, by taste, that I was not his mother”. The main narrative consists of Jules telling us how this state of affairs came to pass.The summary of Jules’s and Leon’s relationship is characteristically wry. Failed DJ Leon is your quintessential booze-addled fuckboy, past his prime, charismatic but chronically unfaithful. Whenever he takes cocaine, he tells the student girls about the hole in his heart, diagnosed as a baby. “But it still works and everything?” one of them asks Jules. “I’d shrugged a shoulder. By that point, Leon and I had been married four years. Debatable, I’d said.” Lines like this are a reminder of the humour and freshness that made Send Nudes so entertaining and insightful.Sams’s vivid descriptions of Gunk, a dingy club that stinks of skunk and bubblegum vape and has portable toilets in the smoking area, will spark powerful memories in anyone who has worked in late-night hospitality. What a pleasure, also, to read about characters who aren’t burdened by the weight of their own educations. Sams knows that the people with the best stories are the barmaids, the bouncers and the dish pigs, not the privileged students who patronise the club. “She hadn’t learned to pontificate, to babble,” Jules says of nim. “That was what all these kids really studied at university, I was sure: how to sound smart, whether or not they actually were.”Indeed, Sams’s choice of setting brought to mind another writer who started young, Gwendoline Riley, whose 2002 debut, Cold Water, centred around a Manchester dive bar. Sams shares that picaresque interest in the transient world of barmaids and the barflies that buzz around them, and some of Riley’s dry humour. “I always thought this was extreme behaviour, vaguely American,” Jules remarks of the fact that Leon’s mother sends him a hamper every Christmas. Of Brighton: “We could have been in Paris, if it wasn’t for all the Tescos.”Sams’s novel is a plottier, more commercial endeavour, however. It lacks the strangeness and some of the humour of Send Nudes, and at times the characterisation feels too reminiscent of short fiction. I found myself wanting a more intimate (dare I say novelistic) exploration of Jules’s maternal longing. There’s nothing wrong with telling rather than showing – some of the most interesting authors are tellers – but being given most of Jules’s and Leon’s marriage as backstory means that we lose a certain viscerality in that retelling. We know Jules desperately wants a baby, but we don’t quite feel it with her.Saying that, Jules’s reticence, her unwillingness to allow herself to need anyone, is vital to her character arc, and I don’t doubt that Sams knew what she was doing. She’s a skilled writer, sometimes a sublime one, as when, for example, she describes nim’s unborn baby kicking: “a sliding, continuous hardness that came once and then again, muscular as an eel beneath the skin”. The way she relates labour, birth and newborns (“a blue squirm, soaking wet”) is a mark of her talent and will make you forgive her occasional lapse into cliche.At the heart of Gunk is a profound message about the insufficiency of the nuclear family, and a suggestion of possible alternatives. It’s a radical thought, one that Sams is well placed to articulate, and she does so with tenderness. I am certain that with room to experiment, if she leans into her instinct for the eccentric and the uncomfortable, there will be much more acclaim to come.

            "content": "While staying on the northern Pelion peninsula in Greece we made our way by foot along the coast path to Paralia Fakistra beach, which is only accessible via a walk in from local villages along the coast. The white pebble beach is backed by a freezing cold waterfall, which cools you down after the dusty, challenging coast path route. The crystal-blue water is home to lots of sea life and snorkelling was joyous. One of the attractions that keeps visitor numbers down is that there are no cafes or bars or even shade, so I recommend taking a light parasol and some cool drinks, but keep your load light as the walk can get hot, especially along the coast path from nearby Damouchari, another great beach spot on the Pelion.Layla AstleyOur favourite beach in Europe is Plage de Péru in Corsica. It can be reached by a pleasant downhill walk from the Greek village of Cargèse. However, we were lucky enough to have direct access from the Hotel Thalassa, a simple and sleepy hotel with balconies and a leafy garden facing the turquoise waters. There may be better beaches in Corsica but we love this one as it’s perfect for swimming and never seems to get busy. You can spend a day walking from the beach to the local Genoese tower, then return and grab a seat at one of the beach pailottes where you can eat or drink watching the sunset.Eleanor Guardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels. A selection of tips will be featured online and may appear in print. To enter the latest competition visit the readers' tips homepage-The Cyclades island of Naxos has stunning beaches everywhere but there’s nothing like Kastraki. It has the softest white sand, which extends under the stunning, crystal-clear water that sometimes is the lightest blue, and sometimes turquoise. Perfect for swimming as it’s never too still to be boring, rarely too wavy to be dangerous. The best thing about Kastraki is that depending on where you want to be, you can have wild and deserted or you can have busy. Go towards the south - but this applies to most of the beach really - for several miles of glorious peacefulness, where you’ll hear nothing but the sea. If you like good low-key services, go to the north bit, right next to the little headland. You’ll find some sunbeds and a great taverna right on the sand. The whole place is pure bliss; the only way you can top it is if you stay to watch the sunset, then catch some cocktail vibes in the beach bar 100 metres back next to the marsh, then dinner in the beach’s little village.CrisWe had a wonderful week in Les Sables d’Olonne in the Vendée last year. The town has plenty of sites to see - the shell museum was well worth a trip – and there are many seafood restaurants to choose from and everything you’d expect from a well-loved, mainly French-visited seaside resort. The main beach (La Grande Plage) is extremely popular with everyone, and has beignet- and glace-sellers and beach volleyball. However, we found ourselves gravitating to the less busy Plage de la Paracou, smaller and more rugged with no tourist trappings and the most wonderful sunsets where we were at times one of only a handful of people on the sands as far as could be seen. There was also a fantastic small open-air bar just over the dune, which had great live acoustic music and drinks a few nights a week. DollyFrom the classic hilltop town of Motovun in the beautiful Istrian countryside it’s a relaxed 40-mile (60km) drive to Brestova and the winding, sloping road to the slipway. Sea-spray on the brief ferry-ride across to Porozina on Cres island gives way to a heat-hazy road-cruise down the island, crossing on to Lošinj over the rotating bridge at the impossibly pretty village of Osor (population 26). Heading south another 12 miles or so we reached pine-shaded Mali Lošinj for basking on rocks and plunging from them into deep, clear water.Mark de BrunnerEither side of Ystad (of Wallander fame) on the southern tip of Sweden, you’ll find several unspoiled stretches of soft white sand. To the east is Sandhammaren, a seemingly endless ribbon of gold fringed by forest. To the west, there are shorter stretches of sand punctuated by the odd restaurant or cafe for fika and separated from civilisation by grassy dunes. One day last August, my boyfriend and I cycled (along dedicated cycle paths) from Ystad to the wonderful Skateholm Strand, stopping off at several more beautiful beaches along the way. As the Swedish school holidays had finished, we practically had the place to ourselves.HelenSign up to The TravellerGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian Holidaysafter newsletter promotionOne of the best beaches for adventurous souls has to be Playa de Güigüí on the west coast of Gran Canaria. It has wild, remote beauty and is only reached by a long, invigorating hike through steep, rocky terrain. Be sure to set off early with lunch and plenty of water packed as there is nothing close by at all. After the trek with stunning views, you will be rewarded with clear, gentle waves for a much-needed swim and stretches of secluded sand all to yourself.AlziraThe beaches of the town of Tropea are framed by the Sanctuary Santa Maria dell Isola and cliffs and houses high above. The turquoise water is the clearest I’ve seen in Calabria. Tropea is so friendly, beautiful, delicious, affordable – what a delight. The B&Bs we’ve stayed in there all are full of warm Italian hospitality. Eating out is reasonably priced and restaurants offer superb menus, as always. David innes-wilkinI’ve been lucky enough to spend several summers at Kadikalesi beach, tucked away on the Bodrum peninsula. Easy to reach by dolmuş (minibus), it’s a peaceful hideaway. Mornings drift by with gentle swims and coffee sips by the water’s edge, and I like to spend afternoons lounging under olive trees to the lull of soft waves. Local cafes serve fresh lahmacun and pide (a kind of Turkish pizza), kofte (meatballs) and frothy ayran (yoghurt drink). Best of all are the evenings, when the sky blushes pink and orange over the Aegean, and the whole world seems to slow down – I can’t imagine a summer without it.Yasmin AnnThe train from Barcelona deposits its passengers right on the shore of Sant Pol de Mar’s harbour. The sound of gently bobbing rigging and the whiff of seafood drifts somewhere from the village, where the promise of a splendid lunch awaits. The Playa el Morer is reached on foot along a curving bay after which frazzled city-dwellers dig their heels in that hot, inviting amber sand and bliss out with siestas and the occasional dip. Sant Pol, it seems, exists to mend broken hearts, heal the soul and is a place where all is well in the world.Liz",

In person, though, James is the polar opposite of the characters he is best known for – considered, introspective and disarmingly earnest.Last year, he took on a radically different role, as Barrington (below) in the BBC adaptation of Bernardine Evaristo’s novel Mr Loverman, a closeted Windrush-generation Caribbean man in a secret relationship with his best friend. Quietly moving, it is a drastic shift in tone for James, and has earned him his first solo Bafta TV nomination.What has the response to Mr Loverman been like?\n Older black men and women have come up to me and found different ways of saying thank you. I read that as thank you for finally telling this untold story, of the LGBTQ+ people who were also on the boats coming from the West Indies to search for a better life.Bernardine Evaristo was told Mr Loverman was ‘too niche’ to be adapted for TV, because it’s ‘black, gay and old’. What does it mean to you to help disprove that?\n I had no doubt whatsoever it would be made from the moment I read the book, and I wanted to be playing Barry.The show feels very London, but you actually split your time between LA and the UK. What is the atmosphere like in the US at the moment?\n I’ve been on and off in America for 17 years, and it’s unlike any other time I’ve been here. There is a battle going on for the soul of this country. It’s scary, particularly if you are in any way deemed as “other”. A lot of the rights we fought for are under threat. It’s scary for our industry, too, because there will come a point where they will try to dictate our output. That censorship has already started.Do you think a show like Mr Loverman would get made in present-day US?\n I doubt it. It is the kind of story that many connected to the present administration would like not to be told. One thing that has taken me by surprise, being a black Brit in America, is how little white America and black America know about one another. That gulf between the two is in danger of getting wider.Does the political turmoil make you consider moving back to the UK?\n Of course. But I don’t like being told what to do. If there’s anything I learned from growing up in a racially explosive time, where people were telling you who you could be, it was a very firm “fuck that”. This feels very much like one of those times again. And to walk away, although it’s obviously very tempting, feels wrong.You’re probably most famous for playing Morgan Jones in The Walking Dead. Did you learn anything about survival from being on the show?\n One of the byproducts of being in the zombie world for as long as I was, was I started having very vivid and lucid dreams. I would quite often wake up shouting in the midst of a night terror, waking the house and making it difficult for my wife to sleep next to me. Someone suggested CBD oil, and it works. So I’d take that into a dystopia.What is a TV show you’ve binge-watched this year?The Pitt. It was such brave storytelling. I started watching it with my wife and then I was away filming. Neither of us could wait, so we watched it separately then had to figure out how far the other one had got so we could talk about it.Any guilty pleasure shows?White Lotus. I hadn’t seen the first two seasons – I’m not very good at watching obnoxious characters on screen – but one of my best mates, Jason Isaacs, is in the latest season. I started watching it, and it hooked me. Jas’s performance was fantastic. We’ve known each other since just after drama school. I’m not as good as him, but I try.

            "content": "Good morning! The invitation to Buckingham Palace has paid off and the UK has become the first country to get a coveted trade deal with the United States since Donald Trump became president and plunged the global economy into chaos.After Rachel Reeves came home empty handed from her trip to Washington DC last month, there had been fears that the UK would languish at the back of the line of countries queueing up before Trump – and to use the president’s words, “kissing my ass” – to try to secure concessions from the sweeping tariffs he inflicted on the world shortly after taking office.In the end, the efforts of the UK’s negotiating team reaped results and at an exuberant press conference yesterday, Donald Trump and Keir Starmer congratulated each other on the “terrific” and “historic” deal that they had struck in record time.Under the deal, the US will remove the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminium and cut the rate on most car exports from 27.5% to 10%. In return, the UK government will remove the tariff on ethanol for US goods and agree on reciprocal market access for beef products.But underneath all the celebratory rhetoric, how significant is this deal and what will be the impact on the UK economy? I talked to the Guardian’s economics editor Heather Stewart to dig into the details.Papacy | Robert Prevost, the first US cleric to lead the Roman Catholic church, has said “evil will not prevail” as he addressed a crowd of 100,000 pilgrims and tourists in his first speech as Pope Leo XIV from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica. Read more on the new pope.Kashmir crisis | India claimed to have thwarted retaliatory missile and drone strikes launched by Pakistan that attempted to hit sites in Indian-administered Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan.Labour | More than 40 Labour MPs have written to the prime minister warning him that planned disability cuts are “impossible to support” and have called for a pause and change in direction. New MPs and veterans from the left and right of the party are setting up for the biggest rebellion of Keir Starmer’s premiership.Gender | A cross-party committee of MPs has written to the UK’s equalities watchdog to seek assurances that its guidance on how organisations interpret the landmark supreme court ruling on gender issues does not ignore the needs of transgender people.UK news | A woman has been cleared of illegally terminating a pregnancy after taking abortion pills during lockdown. Nicola Packer, 45, took the pills at home in November 2020. She had been prescribed mifepristone and misoprostol after a remote consultation.Since Brexit, striking a trade deal with the US has been considered the holy grail of UK trade policy.The US is a vital trading partner for the UK, with imports from and exports to the world’s largest economy accounting for over £300bn – almost £1 in every £6 of all UK trade around the world.Keir Starmer is framing this deal as a huge victory for both his government and the UK. Supporters will say the deal is an exoneration of his approach to dealing with Donald Trump, which has seen Starmer heap praise on Trump’s statesmanship, hand out an invite to meet the king live on TV, and lobby for Trump’s Scottish golf course to be made the host of the Open golf championship.Yet with the global economy faltering and the impact of the Trump tariffs starting to sink in, the question remains whether this deal will change much for the UK’s economic prospects in the long term.What is actually in the deal?Trump is framing this deal a vindication of his economic policies and the UK will not get any relief from the 10% baseline tariffs imposed on all goods exported to the US.However, the US will remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium exports, one of the UK’s key aims while negotiating. It’s also good news for the Britain’s beleaguered automotive industry, which will see the rate on most cars exported to the US slashed from 27.5% to 10%. In response, share prices of the Aston Martin Lagonda and jet engine maker Rolls-Royce have already risen.Although the US government is heralding the UK’s agreement to offer reciprocal market access on beef as a big win for US farmers, none of the government’s “red lines” on conceding to lowering food standards on imports were crossed. Even though the UK is opening market access for US beef products, the government insists it won’t have to accept meat that falls below domestic welfare or safety standards.Heather says it is also notable what is missing from the deal – it will have come as a surprise that Britain did not budge on its digital services tax despite US pressure to do so. It is also not clear from the deal whether the UK will be given preferential treatment in future tariffs on the film industry or pharmaceuticals.How ‘full and comprehensive’ is the deal really?Heather says that despite all the pomp and bluster, and Trump’s claims that this is a “full and comprehensive” deal, there isn’t actually a huge amount in there.The main point is that the UK has managed to carve out some relief for the steel and car industries and avoid any major concessions that would cause a serious political headache, and the US has been allowed to claim victory in its America First tariff wars.“We can expect the government to say that they managed to achieve what successive Conservative prime ministers failed to do in striking a deal but that is a bit disingenuous because they were after a comprehensive trade agreement and this a really limited trade deal designed to mitigate the damage of the Trump tariffs,” she says.There is a big difference between trade deals and trade agreements: trade deals are usually short-term and limited while trade agreements are broad based and long term. As Andrew Sparrow the Guardian’s live blog editor wrote: “A big India-style agreement, this is not.”Is this a genuine win for the UK?Coming hot on the heels of the trade deal with India announced last week and ahead of a EU/UK Summit on the 19 May, the government says the deal with the US shows it is delivering and building momentum towards its promises on economic growth.However, for Heather, the fact that we were the first across the line is less to do with our crack negotiating skills and more to do with the fact that Trump’s main complaint over trading terms lies elsewhere.“In Trump’s mind, if you have a trade deficit you’re being cheated in some way and so he’s fixated on the EU and China which he feels are somehow pulling a fast one on the US,” she says.“We don’t have this deficit, largely because we’ve hollowed out our domestic manufacturing industry, so ours would be one of the simpler trade deals to agree because there are likely to have been less sticking points.”Heather says that although the UK actually didn’t give away that much, it is still in a worse position than it was just a few months ago in terms of trading arrangements with one of our most important partners.It is, she says, less a blueprint for increasing prosperous trading arrangements and more an attempt to roll back some of the damage done by Trump’s America First economic policies.“I think you can frame this not so much as a big win but as a big relief, especially for those sectors who were really on the ropes such as car manufacturing,” says Heather.“It’s significant that Starmer held his press conference surrounded by car workers because he wants to say, we did this to protect jobs and protect our industry. It’s also a win that they haven’t given away anything that will compromise their dealings with the EU. But I think in general this deal is like the school bully giving some but not all of your lunch money back.”What is in it for the US?It’s also worth noting that despite Trump and his entourage bragging that today proved him to be single-handedly reworking the dynamics of global trade, the US needed this deal to happen almost as much as the UK.Trump’s pitch to the American public is that he’s a master deal-maker and reliable custodian of the US economy and his polling – both personally and in terms of his economic policies – is tanking.The White House needed an off-ramp from Trump’s global tariff fallout and this deal could provide just that; it will signal to other trading partners that the administration is stepping away from a war footing towards a desire to forge more normal bilateral trade relationships.“The markets will respond positively to this deal because what Trump has shown is that he’s willing to negotiate if you give him something and accept the 10% tariff,” says Heather. “It’s a roadmap for other countries to follow.”Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionWhat is the potential impact of the deal on the UK economy?Heather says that the deal itself is unlikely to solve the Starmer government’s economic woes. Trump’s entire tariff policy, including a projected slowdown in global economic growth, is likely to shave just 0.3% off GDP in three years’ time.“It’s very important to have this piece of good news to take to the public and now that the Bank of England has cut interest rates they’re going to have positive headlines about people’s mortgages going down and this deal being done and that will help boost consumer and business confidence,” says Heather. “But in terms of the broader economic impact this deal is really quite small.”Heather says that deal or no deal, Reeves is facing the damaging prospect of breaking her own fiscal promises and having to decide whether to raise taxes or cut public spending to try to make up the shortfall. With last week’s dire local election results for her government, some of her economic decisions are also proving hugely unpopular.In other words, the chancellor has bigger problems than this limited trade deal can fix.At just after 5pm last night, white smoke from the Vatican signalled that the conclave was over and a new papacy had begun. More than 100,000 pilgrims and tourists celebrated in St Peter’s Square as it was announced that 69-year-old US cardinal Robert Francis Prevost had been elected as Pope Leo XIV. Appearing in his papal robes, the new pope spoke words of peace to the crowd below who roared back their approval. Here are some key pieces to understand more about Pope Leo what his election will mean for the Catholic church.In this piece, Sam Jones profiles the new moderate and good-humoured American popeIn this explainer, Harriet Sherwood sets out the challenges mounting up in the papal in-trayJenna Amatulli and Leigh Giangreco report from Pope Leo’s home town of Chicago about reactions to his electionClass, writes Larry Elliot in his column, remains a defining feature of British politics.

You can hear it in the way she leaps from one source to another, unburdened by considerations of genre or longstanding notions of cool. There’s something infectious and gleeful about the way she stitches together her disparate influences. But her real skill lies in her ability to imprint her own identity on the results. The music on Fancy That feels simultaneously boiled down yet packed with ideas, fleeting but not lacking, familiar but fresh, focused less on making grand statements than with immediacy and unforced fun: all perennially good things for pop music to be. Alexis PetridisFilm\n  Ocean with David Attenborough | ★★★★★\n A visual marvel like all his work, governed by his own matchless authority and striking a steady tonal balance between warning and hope, David Attenborough’s new film about the oceans is absorbing and compelling. He makes a passionate case against the ruin caused by industrial overfishing and the sinister mega-trawlers which roam everywhere, brutally and wastefully hoovering up fish populations of which the majority is often simply thrown away. As he arrives at his 99th birthday, Sir David presents this new documentary in the context of his own remarkable life and career, studying and thinking about the oceans as the last part of the world to be fully understood and also, perhaps, the last part to be exploited – and despoiled. Peter BradshawTVUntold: Shooting Guards | ★★★★☆\n Elite sport has millions of stories about kids who didn’t quite make it, but the bigger tragedy is the young adult who gets to the big leagues then throws it all away. The reliable US documentary strand Untold has found numerous variations on this sad old story over the years, and it’s turned up a devastating one in Shooting Guards, which tracks the parallel lives of basketball pros Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton. When Crittenton wades into a minor argument about borrowed money on a flight home from an away fixture, Arenas spies a chance for a wind-up. This leads to the incident that will define their lives. Untold: Shooting Guards sensitively examines the ruthless cruelties of top-level sport, and a society where some lonely, angry young men seem born to lose – even if they really should be winners.

            "content": "Not much about Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the European Union is settled, but Keir Starmer can justifiably claim it has been “reset”. That word was artfully chosen before last year’s election to dress low aspiration as high diplomacy. There are 10 days of negotiation before the summit in London, where a new UK-EU partnership is due to be unveiled. It will be more outline than substance. But there is progress in the very fact that Britain’s ruling party sees Brussels as a partner, not a parasite.Old-guard Eurosceptics will, of course, denounce any deal as a betrayal of Brexit. If there are plans for a time-limited, youth exchange visa, it will be decried as a return to free movement by the back door. If there is agreement to align regulations so that goods can more efficiently cross borders and the European court of justice is involved in adjudicating compliance, the high priests of sovereignty will anathematise it for heresy. Any commonality on carbon levies or renewed permission for the French to fish in British waters will be painted in shades of surrender.But the imprecations will be muttered from the sidelines to a dwindled crowd of zealots. Most Britons see the prospect of better relations with the EU as desirable, or at least uncontroversial. That was already true in 2023, when Rishi Sunak signed the Windsor framework to fix bugs in the way that Brexit applied to Northern Ireland, and when he agreed that British scientists could rejoin the EU’s Horizon scheme. It was true when Kemi Badenoch, as Sunak’s trade and business secretary, dropped a deadline for the automatic expiry of thousands of EU regulations that had been retained in UK law. Those accommodations with reality were also dilutions of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal. Sunak enjoyed cordial relations with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president. She called him “dear Rishi” in a press conference.If a reset is defined by warmer rhetoric and a commitment to stop doing really stupid stuff, the process was under way even before Starmer entered Downing Street. To observe the continuity is not to downplay the difference that a Labour government makes. The centrepiece of Starmer’s plan is a defence and security alliance framed in terms of continental solidarity and, by implication, a hedge against American strategic infidelity. That would have been taboo to any Tory leader. The same applies to something as obviously sensible as an agreement to hold regular summits, formalising a system for rolling UK-EU dialogue.In important respects, Starmer has renounced the Europhobic spirit that guided Johnson’s Brexit. But in more substantial ways he is stuck with the letter of the deal that Johnson actually signed. Its core functions are preserved in red lines ruling out a return to the single market or the customs union.If there is value in that prohibition, it consists only in electoral tactics. As economic policy and strategic positioning, it is pointlessly self-limiting. Maybe it was essential to neutralise Brexit as a toxic issue in the election campaign. We can only hypothesise about counterfactual scenarios where Labour kept more options open and was either punished by voters or won a large majority anyway. But the room for manoeuvre available within those red lines is measurable, and it is small. A veterinary agreement, easing border friction for agricultural exports, is good to have, for example, but it won’t stimulate a bounty of growth.Refusal to deviate from Tory-era Brexit orthodoxies is doubly limiting. By ruling out ambitious models of future integration, and doing so in transparent fear of a domestic backlash, Starmer discourages Brussels negotiators from flexibility even in those areas where discussion is permitted. It sends the signal that British politics, beneath the new surface warmth of a Labour government, retains a deep and cold cultural suspicion of the European project. It conveys systemic ignorance, tediously familiar from Brexit negotiations, of how the EU even works; how it is an alliance governed by laws and treaties that signs deals with states, not political parties.Starmer earned a goodwill dividend by virtue of not being a Tory, but he overestimates the leverage that gives him as an architect of future relations when his successor could feasibly be Nigel Farage.Pro-European vibes from a Labour prime minister also cannot overcome the asymmetry of Johnson’s Brexit, which was conceived in aggression against Brussels but inflicted more harm on Britain. It didn’t leave the EU side wanting much. Starmer does have cards to play. In the European league, the UK’s defence and security capabilities are equalled only by France. Russian aggression in Ukraine, coupled with Donald Trump’s vindictive anti-European streak, make a case for hugging Britain close – but not if the Brexit virus is merely dormant.The trade deal that Starmer agreed with the US president on Thursday may not clash explicitly with goals he is simultaneously pursuing in Brussels, but the balancing act is inherently unstable. Trump hates the EU for its geopolitical autonomy as a continental trading bloc. He wants it broken. That is understood in Brussels as an existential threat.Sooner or later, there will come a crisis that forces Starmer to choose between solidarity with Europe and vassalage to Washington. His studious effort to maintain equidistance is liable to be interpreted in Brussels as another symptom of deep-tissue Brexitism in the UK body politic.That needn’t bother the prime minister if his ambitions for a future EU relationship are even more modest than they look; if his definition of a new strategic partnership is a slow, grinding technocratic adjustment to the status quo. But if he really has something more substantial and transformative in mind he must declare it aloud, not just in Brussels but at home.Getting a good deal from the EU and earning public support for it are part of the same process. A leader who looked capable of changing the terms of debate, proactively challenging Brexit myths, would unlock goodwill in negotiations and get a better deal. A pro-European agenda can be advanced only so far by stealth. At some point, the time must come to win the argument. And that can’t happen with an argument that is never even made.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and more.

            "content": "Delicate, shell-shaped madeleines are always irresistible, but their charm fades quickly, because these little cakes tend to dry out within hours. To counter that, I’ve taken an untraditional turn by incorporating a little oil and milk to keep them soft and spongy for a couple of days. Matcha, the finely ground green tea powder, comes in a range of grades; use the best you can afford, but don’t be tempted to add more for the appealing colour – the sweet, grassy notes can tip into bitterness in an instant.Prep 5 min\n Chill 2 hr\n Cook 1 hr\n Makes 24For the madeleines80g unsalted butter, plus 10g extra, softened, for greasing50ml sunflower oil, or other neutral oil 60ml milk1 tbsp matcha – I use Clearspring150g plain flour, plus extra for dusting1¾ tsp baking powder¼ tsp fine sea salt3 large eggs\n   140g caster sugar\n   1 tsp vanilla extractFor the glaze and topping120g icing sugar, sifted2 tbsp milk\n  ¼ tsp matchaA pinch of salt\n  40g desiccated coconutMelt the butter in a small saucepan on a low heat. Take off the heat, whisk in the oil, milk and matcha, then set aside to cool. Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and set aside.Put the eggs, sugar and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer and whisk on medium-high for about five minutes, until light and billowy. Sift the dry ingredients on to the egg mixture in two to three batches, folding in gently with a hand whisk after each addition. When it’s all nearly combined, dribble a third of the butter/matcha mixture down the side of the bowl, and fold in gently with the whisk to incorporate. Repeat with the remaining matcha/butter mix.Scrape the batter into a container, cover and refrigerate for at least two hours and up to two days.When ready to bake, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/350F/gas 6. Using a small pastry brush, paint the cavities of a 12-hole madeleine pan with the extra 10g softened butter, then sprinkle a little flour over each one. Tap and rotate the pan so the moulds are evenly coated with a thin film of flour, then turn the pan upside down over a bin or sink and tap to remove any excess flour.Drop (or pipe) a heaped tablespoon of the cold batter into each cavity to fill by three-quarters (you’ll need about 25g in each hole), then bake for about 10 minutes – the madeleines will form a dome in the centre and should feel firm to the touch when tapped gently with your fingers. Remove from the oven, leave to stand for a minute, then ease out of the tin and transfer to a wire rack to cool. (If baking another dozen madeleines on the same day, wash and dry the pan well before repeating with the remaining batter).To make the glaze, combine all the ingredients except the desiccated coconut in a small mixing bowl and whisk smooth – the glaze should cascade easily down a spoon. Holding one madeleine upright over the bowl, spoon the glaze over the ridged side of the cake and let the excess drip back into the bowl. Put the madeleine glazed side up on a lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining madeleines. Before the icing sets, sprinkle desiccated coconut over a third of the madeleines and transfer to a cake platter to serve.",

            "content": "It is sad when a ruthless military dictator funds his government by destroying ecologically important rainforest, logging tropical trees and displacing and robbing the people who live in and depend on the forests for their livelihoods and culture.This happened in my country, Liberia.When, in 2005, I became the country’s first president to be elected after a devastating civil war that deposed that dictator, I was charged with helping Liberia recover.Liberia has more than half of west Africa’s remaining forests, which cover almost half of the country, approximately 6.6m hectares (16m acres) based on the 2019 National Forest Inventory. But our special trees have long been threatened because the timber fetches premium prices.At the end of the war, we found that about 60% of our country had been allocated in 28 logging “concessions” – agreements with companies providing exclusive rights to log the forests.My government cancelled all of these concessions and implemented a moratorium to better understand what we were harvesting and where it came from. We lifted the moratorium after we introduced a transparent process to allocate new logging and other land-use concessions.In 2006, we secured passage of the National Forestry Reform Law, which recognised the problems of the past and stressed the integration of community, conservation and commercial forest management for the benefit of all Liberians. The reform process was supported by the UN, the World Bank and the European Union, aiming to improve Liberia’s forest governance, promote sustainable management, enhance transparency in the sector and secure the future of its vast forest resources.Today, the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) runs systems that track timber harvesting, locating the geographic source and species of every piece of wood exported from Liberia. With this transparency, the timber market can steer clear of anything harvested illegally – from protected areas, endangered trees or community lands without consent.Timber exports accounted for 7.5% of Liberia’s GDP in 2020, much of it shipped to Chinese markets. EU log imports from Liberia were $2m in 2020, one-seventh of that sold to China. It is important to diversify our reliance on this one market to help generate a more sustainable future for the sector, and greater access to European markets is essential to achieving this ambition.The system Liberia uses to track timber production was developed after we signed the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EU. The VPA was an important signal that Liberia was serious about gaining control over logging, and that the EU recognised these positive developments. Commendably, transparency in sourcing is required of all timber produced under a VPA, including for export to EU markets.This agreement was one of the first critical steps implemented by my government. Forest sector oversight and increasing the credibility of timber exports, including for European markets, has been crucial in Liberia’s recovery.But the mood today is to retreat from international commitments and cooperation. The EU has moved to cancel this agreement, threatening a key segment of our economy. And without recognition in markets that give importance to compliance with our regulations, we are worried that the illegal timber trade will once again take root in our country.We risk the disintegration of the system that has supported forest sector oversight, one that established a unique benefit-sharing mechanism for local people, resulting in $4.3m going to communities already, with additional revenues to come that are tracked through Liberia’s systems, set up through the VPA.Considering the context of Liberia, with its history of conflict, restoring the forestry sector is a slow process with many ups and downs. Cancelling the VPA would undermine our achievements over the years and seriously put at risk any governance reforms.This is not theoretical. The Grebo-Krahn national forest, on Liberia’s border with Ivory Coast, might not have survived to this day without more sustainable and economically feasible alternatives.Grebo-Krahn is home to pygmy hippos, a critically endangered species that became popular recently on social media when two zoos posted images of pygmy hippo calves. There are only 2,000 of them left in the wild, most of them in Liberia.We worry what will become of this species, along with other endangered wildlife.There is huge concern for the communities that live in and depend on the forest and all other threatened regions if illegal timber becomes the norm once more.We live in an interconnected global community where mutual support is essential. While the EU-Liberia VPA may not hold significant weight in every part of the world, it has been crucial to our social and economic security. This is an agreement that must not be cancelled.Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the 24th president of Liberia, was the first elected female head of state in Africa. She won the Nobel peace prize in 2011",

            "content": "From the top of Knowth’s great mound, my gaze leaps over its smaller satellite mounds and wanders across an expanse of summer-green fields. This is Brú na Bóinne, a vast neolithic complex looped by the River Boyne, where the landscape is dominated by three artificial “hills” that were layered over passage tombs built about 5,000 years ago.The most famous of the three is to the south – Newgrange, which is aligned with the winter solstice sunrise. To the east is Dowth, which aligns with winter sunsets. And then there’s this one beneath my feet, the great mound, containing two back-to-back chambers facing east and west. As ever with such ancient structures, the big question is: what was it for?The chambers could have been intended to catch the sunlight of the spring and autumn equinoxes (in March and September), when day and night are of equal duration. This is potentially affirmed by the equinoctial shadows cast by lone standing stones towards the east and west passage entrances. But Knowth was also a place of settlement and burial for thousands of years. All that human activity over the millennia damaged its passages, with the sunlight now only reaching a short distance along their lengths.Another intriguing possibility is that the great mound is the result of neolithic people’s sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, which integrates an understanding of both the solar and lunar cycles. Knowth’s megalithic art – the largest collection in Europe – hints at this purpose. Much of the artwork is on the massive kerbstones that ring the great mound like a giant’s prayer beads. I head back down the slope and dawdle from stone to stone. The carved lines create abstract pictures that let the imagination soar. Concentric arcs could be the sun. Repeated waves might trace the moon’s path across the sky. And dazzling spirals remind me of Van Gogh’s Starry Night.A series of rapid chitterings makes me look up. I’m close to the east entrance, where the reconstructed woodhenge (a circle of timber pillars) stands above the sockets of the original neolithic one. I think of those first builders. They too must have watched chittering swallows. They too must have seen how a flock carves the sky.

            "content": "As always with pronouncements by President Trump, once you had peeled away the xenophobia, removed the stew of resentment, ignored the sheer idiocy and asterisked the possible illegality, there was a small kernel of truth to his posting on Truth Social last Sunday. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” he wrote, pointing to the nefarious tax breaks other countries gave film-makers as “a National Security threat” and proposing an 100% tariff on films made oversees. “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA AGAIN!”How would a 100% tariff on films made oversees work? Just movies shot overseas? What about movies set overseas? And who would pay? How do you impose tariffs on goods without a port of entry? “Commerce is figuring it out,” said a White House official. In fact, movies are listed as an exception to presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president authority to address national security threats, so it is likely the lawyers would end up figuring it out, if Trump’s plan went ahead. But, many executives in Hollywood are quietly nodding agreement. It is true that Los Angeles has seen feature movie shoot days plummet from 3,901 in 2017 to just 2,403 in 2024, a 38% drop. Many major franchises such as Avatar and Mission: Impossible are shot mostly overseas, where the lure of lucrative tax breaks offset such minor inconveniences as the incursion of some sheep into one of Tom Cruise’s paragliding set-pieces, as happened in the Lake District in 2022.Whether Ethan Hunt’s jaunts around the Cumbrian national park represent a legitimate national security threat – as opposed to, say, including sensitive war plans in a group chat – is best left to historians. Trump’s vision of Maga cinema is much like his vision of Maga America: an attempt to turn back the clock to the 1950s, when movies were still shot on a Hollywood backlot, cinema attendance was at its peak and the US flooded countries, whose previously quota-restricted film industries had been devastated by war, with American films, as part of the Marshall plan. “What we are in fact attempting to do in Europe is to create a Marshall plan of ideas,” wrote political journalist Walter Lippmann in The Cold War: A Study in US Foreign Policy (1947). “We have created a new Athens, a celluloid Athens, in which films and ideas about freedom, democracy, and self-determination are broadcast to all the world.”As usual, Trump is playing his victor-as-victim card. We’re used to hearing protectionist cries from smaller countries protesting America’s cinematic hegemony – not the other way around. “We will become a cultural colony of the United States if this goes on,” said director René Clair after France signed the Blum-Byrnes agreement in 1946, which cleared some of France’s war debt in return for opening up French cinemas to American films. In 1993, when Spielberg’s Jurassic Park stormed into 450 cinemas – a quarter of the country’s 1,800 total – French culture minister Jacques Toubon declared the movie “a threat to French national identity” and claimed that it was every Frenchman’s “patriotic duty” to, instead, see Germinal, an adaptation of Émile Zola’s novel about the 19th-century coalminers starring Gérard Depardieu. Arriving as the general agreement on tariffs and trade talks got under way, Jurassic Park became a political football with which “to confront, with renewed muscle, the yankosaurs who menace our country” as Libération put it. “We cannot allow the Americans to treat us in the way they dealt with the redskins,” director Bertrand Tavernier told the European parliament.Dressing up soft power incursions as hard power threats may, at times, seem irresistible, but there’s a wide gulf between “perceived national security threats” and “actual national security threats”. Trump’s proposal to make American films great again would lump the US together with such isolationist, authoritarian states as China and Iran. When Avatar proved wildly popular to Chinese audiences in 2010, it was pulled early from theatres to make room for a biopic of Confucius, after officials fretted its themes of resistance to imperialism could stoke unrest. In Iran, last month, Maryam Moghaddam and Behtash Sanaeeha, the directors of the gentle romance My Favourite Cake, whose heroine is shown without a headscarf, were sentenced to 14 months in prison on charges of “spreading lies with the intention of disturbing public opinion”.The national security apparatus of the state makes for a notoriously poor film critic. When Soviet authorities allowed John Ford’s adaptation of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath (1940) into cinemas on the basis that it showed the suffering of a poor American farming family during the Great Depression, one audience member reportedly remarked: “They may have been poor, but at least they had a truck.” It’s important to remember that, though France attempted to restage the Battle of Little Bighorn over the influx of Hollywood movies in 1946, they lost and the result was the French New Wave, as directors like Truffaut, Godard, Rivette and Chabrol played catchup with the sudden glut of American movies, and fashioned their own homegrown counterpoint. “What switched me to films was the flood of American pictures into Paris after the Liberation,” said Truffaut who, between 1946 and 1956, watched more than 3,000 films by the likes of Welles, Hitchcock and Ford, that had gathered dust during the Nazi occupation.Movies have always been an international medium and market, and are only getting more so. Jurassic Park may have smushed Germinal at the box office – $1bn to $6m – but 1993 marked another important watershed, as Hollywood’s foreign revenue outstripped domestic revenue for the first time in its history. Today, international markets account for more than 70% of Hollywood’s box office revenue. Ironically, Hollywood is one of the few places where the US does not see one of Trump’s dreaded trade deficits. According to the Motion Picture Association, the industry enjoys a $15.3bn trade surplus, and with that surplus has come an undeniable softening of the amount of American flag-waving we see on screen. A rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner was removed from Toy Story 2. Bohemian Rhapsody had some of its queerness toned down for the Chinese market. Producers of Top Gun: Maverick removed Taiwan’s flag from Maverick’s bomber jacket, to appease China’s censors, but, after one of the film’s Chinese backers, Tencent, pulled out, it was put back, at least for the version that showed in Taiwan.You can’t enjoy cinematic dominance over other countries and brandish insensitivity to their respective cultures. Hence the pusillanimity that overcame Sony Pictures, after Seth Rogen and James Franco’s 2014 comedy The Interview, about two bumbling journalists who end up involved in a CIA plot to kill Kim Jong-un, precipitated a threat from the North Korean government to “mercilessly destroy anyone who dares hurt or attack the supreme leadership of the country even a bit”. After Sony Pictures’ computers were hacked, and sensitive emails between its executives dumped online, Sony backed down and withdrew the film from release, while another North Korea-set comedy, Pyongyang, about an American accused of spying in the country, was quietly ditched by its production company, New Regency. The film’s star, Steve Carell, tweeted that it was a “sad day for creative expression”.Is this what Trump means by “messaging and propaganda”? Given his fondness for Kim Jong-un and his dislike of queerness, probably not, but the idea of secret messaging that American films are forced to carry if they shoot overseas would appear to be another of Trump’s bogeymen. “I’ve produced or overseen hundreds of movies that were shot overseas, even built studios in Australia and Mexico for that purpose,” responded Bill Mechanic, CEO of Pandemonium Films and the executive who oversaw the shoot of James Cameron’s Titanic in Mexico and Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge in Australia. “Other than China, which offered rigid co-production terms, no foreign government has ever even commented on any political content in any of those movies. None has ever asked for any changes, and never proposed a single idea.”Neither Titanic nor Hacksaw Ridge, needless to say, would have survived Trump’s proposed tariffs. It’s hard to see how so blunt a stick as 100% tariffs would serve to roll back the irreversible forces of globalisation. The way to get production back into the US is incentivise film-makers with tax breaks, not threaten them with tariffs. The most likely effect of tariffs would be to choke what little life remains in the already embattled business of theatrical distribution, annihilate the indie sector, render most low- to mid-budget productions unfinanceable and even dent the big blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible, as studios recalibrate their profit margins. It would result in fewer movies being made in the US, not more.But it’s doubtful whether helping Hollywood was indeed the aim. A believer in free markets, except when he isn’t, Trump has already started to walk back his ludicrous proposal, with the White House saying that “no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made”. Hollywood is not going back to the All-American 1950s anytime soon. The “celluloid Athens” proclaimed by Walter Lippmann is now more like a celluloid Constantinople – increasingly international, plural, connected. “The world is listening,” ran the motto of George Lucas’s THX Dolby system. Yes, but the world is also speaking now. It’s Hollywood’s turn to listen.",

            "content": "Sadiq Khan is announcing plans to build on parts of London’s green belt, in a dramatic shift in housing policy aimed at tackling “the most profound housing crisis in the capital’s history”.In a major speech on Friday, the mayor of London is expected to say the scale of the challenge, which could need about 1m new homes built in the next decade, requires a break from longstanding taboos.It marks the first time city hall will support the strategic release of low-quality or inaccessible green belt land near transport links in order to provide hundreds of thousands of new affordable homes.“The status quo is wrong, out-of date, and simply unsustainable”, Khan will say. “Development on carefully chosen parts of the green belt – done in the right way – would allow us to unlock hundreds of thousands of good-quality new homes for Londoners.“As mayor, I’m not willing to ignore such a prospect just because it might be politically difficult – not when the life chances of the next generation of Londoners are on the line.”London currently builds about 35,000 homes each year, less than half of the 88,000 homes Khan said the city needed to meet demand annually. The mayor reaffirmed his commitment to prioritising building homes on brownfield sites, but said “this alone will not be enough to meet our needs”.This policy will form part of a wider consultation on the next London Plan, which will set out Khan’s vision for how the capital will develop in the next 20-25 years. City hall has commissioned a city-wide green belt review, in line with the government’s requirements, to explore all options for finding enough land to meet housing need across the capital.Khan said this announcement did not contradict his self-proclaimed achievement of being the “greenest mayor London has ever had”, because he would increase biodiversity and the amount of land that was genuinely green and accessible while building on the green belt.His proposals have already received support from the political and housing sector. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said the government welcomed Khan’s “bold” proposal, which “rises to the challenge to tackle London’s housing crisis”. She added: “We cannot end the housing crisis and build the 1.5m homes we need without London being ambitious in its approach.”London councils also welcomed the plan, as did the chief executive of Generation Rent, Ben Twomey, who said the policy would protect Londoners from the “eye-watering cost of renting” that had forced many into poverty and homelessness.Despite this, nature campaigners have told Khan that his plans should not remove precious parks and green spaces from people already living in areas that lack them.Roger Mortlock, chief executive of the countryside charity CPRE, said: “The answer [to the housing crisis] isn’t build on local parks, playing fields and farmland, it’s to transform the market and hold developers to account with ambitious and enforceable targets for social and genuinely affordable homes.”New developments should contain nature areas and green spaces, Kate Ashbrook, the general secretary of the Open Spaces Society, said, while Shaun Spiers of Green Alliance said poor-quality green belt could be converted to high-quality green space, which urban areas often lacked.Khan acknowledged the controversy, but called on Londoners to “keep an open mind” and engage with the evidence. “We have young professionals stuck living in their childhood bedrooms for years on end; Londoners having to endure cold, damp accommodation that isn’t fit for human habitation; couples reluctantly moving out of the capital to start a family; and London primary schools closing because young families have been priced out of the area.“It breaks my heart. The damage the housing crisis is causing is pervasive and profound. We simply cannot let it continue.”",

            "content": "The first manager my son had, when he was seven, got the parents together and told us how shouting could affect our sons’ development and behaviour, not only as players but as human beings. Usually, I don’t behave so badly. The worst I’ve done is to complain to the referee and I’ve sworn once or twice. But mostly I’ve been civil. There was one time, though, when a game was interrupted because the other team had fielded ineligible nine-year-old players. There was a lot of swearing and shouting from managers and dads. My wife decided enough was enough and took our son from the field to go home. He was the team’s only keeper so without him there was no game and several of the other team’s dads taunted us, shouting: “Are you running?”, “Are you scared?”. My wife ignored them and headed for the exit but one of the dads pushed her. Another guy punched me from behind and I completely lost it and punched back. Both teams were expelled from the tournament.André Pereira Leme Lopes, 53, BrazilMy son was 10, and loved football, though it was starting to get too competitive. He was playing centre forward, and his team were winning. The opposition had a very talented defender who was getting increasingly angry. He committed a couple of bad tackles and was warned by the referee. Then he scythed down my son. I have to admit, the red mist came down and I ran on to the pitch to remonstrate with the offending boy. I only realised what I was doing when I was 10 metres on to the pitch and the other parents started to shout at me to calm down. Fortunately, my son wasn’t hurt. But he was a bit embarrassed by his dad’s behaviour.I occasionally refereed my son’s games. There was always lots of abuse towards me. The worst occasion was when I awarded a free kick after a foul on my son. One of the dads said: “That’s your son isn’t it, you fucking cheat.” It was the only time I’ve seen my son in tears on a football field. All I could say to the dad was: “Well done, you’ve made a 10-year-old cry, you must be very proud.”Bryan, 64, Shipston-on-Stour, UKAs a coach for 37 years, a referee for 26, and having played (poorly) until age 50, I have had to deal with over-the-top parents many times. I have reported toxic parents and coaches to club officials and Colorado administrators on a number of occasions. My granddaughter plays in an advanced regional league. At a tournament near Salt Lake City, the ex-husband of one of the player’s mothers started arguing with her new husband. Out came the ex’s AR-15 assault weapon. Suddenly, numerous parents from both teams pulled out their own firearms. Families and players in adjoining fields ran for cover, several climbing over fences to escape. Police came, but amazingly, no criminal charges were filed (or shots fired).Robert Weiss, 76, Colorado, USI run a grassroots football team. I have seen parents trading blows, mothers and fathers. I have footage. I’ve been threatened by dad coaches, grabbing me and threatening to punch me when trying to stop play on a pitch. I’ve been threatened countless times when trying to resolve situations with children playing football.Cole Salewicz, London, UKI was living in Brussels, watching my 10-year-old son playing in a school match. I overheard a father next to me telling his boy: “Look at their eight – if you get the chance, go in so hard you break his leg.” That was enough for me, no more football for my kids.Giacomo Poma, Parma, ItalyMy dad coached my brother’s team in the 80s and was banned for life after punching a referee. His defence: the opposition team were too big to be under 11! (They weren’t.)Emma, Bristol, UKI was a teenager and our team (Skegby Colts FC) was halfway through an unbeaten season. Everyone wanted to up their game and be the ones to take it from us. We visited a top-league team and they were there for blood, encouraged by an especially vitriolic parental fanbase who became increasing feral and violent. The ref essentially lost control of the game. In the lashing rain and mud, we fought out a 5-4 win against constant abuse, verbal and physical, and cheered on from the sideline. After the final whistle, their parents followed us to the changing room, and our manager decided we had to leave then and there before things got worse. We all jumped into our parents’ cars, soaking wet, covered in mud and terrified. Along with the verbal abuse, rocks were thrown at our cars. It’s the most intimidating atmosphere I’ve ever known at any football match, let alone one I was playing in.Daryll Gregory, Mansfield, UKMy son was playing a Sunday game in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire. He was about 15 and I was on the touchline near halfway. My son received a pass and was blatantly onside and went on to beat the keeper and score. The ref (no linesman) ruled it offside. I went ballistic, shouting that he was onside. The ref came over to speak to me, but I’d lost it and kept arguing. He then produced a red card for me. Clearly, I wasn’t going anywhere and he simply said if you don’t go I’m abandoning the game. I trudged off shamefully. On returning home, my son, with a glint in his eye, told my partner I’d been sent off. I managed to find the ref’s home phone number that afternoon and called him to apologise.Mark, Lincoln, UKWatching kids football often feels like a tinderbox about to explode. My 13-year-old son has been playing football since he was tiny, and I must have seen just about everything other than physical violence (fortunately). To say it is just the dads who make kids football a misery though is nonsense. One of the worst things I have witnessed was a mother screaming at her 10-year-old son that if he didn’t play better he wouldn’t get his dinner. Effectively, yelling at him that if his team didn’t win she wouldn’t feed him. Pure child abuse. Often the attitude of the parents aligns with the attitude of the club. That mother wasn’t reprimanded by any of the coaches or other parents and the kids had clearly been actively coached to play dirty. They were pinching, scratching and stamping. At the age of 10. It was a draw, so I’m guessing the poor lad probably went hungry.A Haslam, London People featured in this article responded to a Community callout.You can contribute to open callouts here.

            "content": "They’ve gone Round, Down and Up, and now, for their fourth season, Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman are attempting to ride the Long Way Home. In 2020, the long-running blokes-on-bikes travel series was revived by Apple after a 15-year gap, and it set its stars the task of travelling from the southernmost tip of South America to Los Angeles on electric motorbikes. Not all fans of the previous seasons were enamoured with it, not least because it lacked the everyman appeal of their earlier runs. Having a big team at Harley-Davidson design and custom-build vehicles for the job, and getting a company to install charging points along the route for them, wasn’t quite the same as two old mates jumping on their bikes and camping wherever the mood dictated.It makes sense, then, for Long Way Home to take it back to basics. It certainly seems as if a concerted effort has been made for McGregor and Boorman to be more relatable. We see more of them with their families and children, and it appears to be a more intimate operation. Instead of the fancy central London office and massive logistics team, there’s a big map pinned to the wall of McGregor’s garage, a small gathering of the original crew, and that should do it. Or at least, it’s made to look that way.The plan this time is for the pair to set off from their homes in the UK – McGregor’s is in Perthshire, and Boorman’s in Suffolk – and ride vintage motorbikes on a circular route that visits “17 of our closest neighbours”, taking them all the way up to the Arctic Circle, and back via the Baltic states and western Europe. It’s about 10,000 miles, should take them two months, affords them the comfort of setting off in June, rather than in winter, and seems a little more gentle than their previous efforts. After the horrific motorbike accidents that Boorman has had, and the extensive rehabilitation that followed, who can blame them? “He rides more carefully now, especially at his age,” says Olly, his wife.Unsurprisingly, there is a quieter, steadier pace to this new adventure, and when it does finally hit the road, it turns out to be a smooth and largely agreeable ride. The first episode sets up the idea for where they will go, and follows the two men as they prepare to set off. “We’re going to follow our noses and see what we find on the open road,” says McGregor.It is not a zippy opener. It meanders, delaying the departure, and gives a lot of screen time to an attempt to locate a mobile phone that McGregor’s toddler son has dropped behind a bench. But the idea of doing the trip on old and potentially more rickety bikes puts a few grains of sand in the petrol tank. McGregor opts for a 1974 Moto Guzzi Eldorado police bike, complete with siren, while Boorman (eventually) goes for a BMW R75/5, though his injuries mean he has to choose with more care. Kickstarting, for example, is not as easy as it once was. “My legs are fucked,” he says.When they get on the open road, in episode two, it kicks into gear. They set off from McGregor’s house accompanied by a marching band. “I had to run half-naked over this bridge in Trainspotting 2,” he notes, as they make their way down to Newcastle to catch a ferry to the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, they eat herring, buy cheese and look at tulips. They ride north and watch some fierljeppen, or far-leaping, a traditional sport in which people grab a pole and propel themselves over a body of water. Neither seems keen to have a go.As is often the way with travel shows, and touring in general, the pre-planned set-ups are less interesting than the spontaneous events. The pair head off to Germany, to the home town of Boorman’s late mother, and meet up with members of his family there. But on the way, they encounter another marching band, this time to celebrate a local gun club. The gun club members shoot, they socialise, and by the looks of it, they celebrate life with gusto. See also a Danish bar they visit, whose best customers are of the equine variety.Long Way Home could be a bit more concise. Ten episodes is a lot, and while those early countries are beautiful, the landscape lacks the drama of previous trips, at least until they get to Norway. It may not entertain viewers less invested in McGregor and Boorman’s friendship, or vintage motorcycles, or relentless rain. But the footage of them riding eventually becomes mesmerising, in a gentle, slow-TV kind of way, and while it is steady, it is also perfectly pleasant. Long Way Home is on Apple TV+ now.",

            "content": "I’ve always had a keen sense of adventure. During the summer holidays, my parents would push me and my sister out of the front door and tell us only to come home to eat. I went from roaming the streets of Hackney in east London as a child, to trekking, wild camping and hitchhiking the length of the Americas in my late 20s.After returning to my home in Liverpool, I worked as a photographer and got into a relationship. When we broke up years later, I was distraught – but it led me back to the life of exploration that I’d put on the back‑burner. In the summer of 2016, I embarked on a solo 1,000-mile (1,600km) route through Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Not wanting to feel sealed off from the wondrous environments around me, I did the majority of it on foot.Slow travel has allowed me to have amazing encounters with people from all walks of life. When I tried to recreate these experiences in the UK, I struggled to make connections. Abroad, my foreignness attracts people, whereas in the UK I blend in as a 43-year-old white man. Plus, I’m not a natural at striking up conversations with strangers. So when planning my next trip, a walk that would see me spend five months traversing the length of the UK, I landed on the idea that being accompanied by a pack animal would make me look intriguing enough for people to approach me.I found a donkey from a local farm called Alwood Donkeys. After a few visits, they were incredibly supportive of him joining me. Unlike the rest of his close-knit herd, my donkey was a bit of a loner. They let me name him, so I called him Martin after a friend. After seven months of training, we set off on the near 700-mile adventure from one lighthouse in Cape Wrath, at the top of the Highlands, to another in Dorset.Very quickly, I realised that walking a donkey around suburban streets in Wirral does not in any way prepare you for walking across the west Highlands. It’s an extremely challenging landscape: hilly, mostly moorland, with all kinds of biting insects. For the first six weeks, I felt extremely out of my depth, and constantly questioned whether or not I should be doing the walk and whether Martin was enjoying it.There were lows where I would sink to the ground in tears. Once, I attempted to take Martin across a bog but he wasn’t having any of it. His feet turned out and he became unmovable, which was deeply frustrating. I got angry at him, and felt immensely guilty afterwards.The walk was one of the hardest things I’ve done, but I don’t like quitting. We walked along trails, canals and roads from Glasgow, Lancaster, Leeds and Liverpool to Gloucester, Bristol and Dorchester. Everywhere we went, we put smiles on people’s faces. They were overjoyed to have encountered Martin.People would fall over themselves to help us – letting us camp on their farms, giving me hot food and coffee, cheering us on. Nobody ever turned me away. Having Martin as my partner definitely opened doors – my new girlfriend calls it “playing the donkey card”. My conclusion was that people want to be friendly, but sometimes they just need an excuse.The walk helped to restore my faith in people and taught me that incessantly worrying – like about where we were going to camp each night – doesn’t solve anything.Sign up to Inside SaturdayThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When I started putting Martin’s needs before my own and letting him dictate how the day would go (to an extent!), the whole thing became much more pleasurable. I was surprised by how affectionate he became. After each day, we’d have a cuddle, and his head would get heavier and heavier in the crook of my arm.I felt that this wouldn’t be the end of our relationship. When I returned home, I bought him. He still lives on the farm, but I pay his keep and see him at least twice a month. We’ve done a few walks since – one from Liverpool to Blackpool, and soon a month-long walk in Scotland. Not only did I walk the entire length of the UK, but I made a lifelong friend in a 15-year-old donkey called Martin. As told to Jordan PageDo you have an experience to share?

            "content": "After 14 election campaigns reaching from Bob Hawke to Anthony Albanese, Laura Tingle has had enough of covering federal politics. “I never intended to do it for the rest of my life, and now it’s 40 years,” Tingle told Weekly Beast. When a job ad for global political editor, replacing John Lyons, hit her inbox, she saw an exciting opportunity. Far from being parachuted by Aunty into a “plum new gig”, as the Australian reported, the political editor for 7.30 faced an interview panel of seven inquisitors from the ABC’s international division.Understandably, fans of her forthright analytical skills, which she demonstrates across 7.30, Radio National’s Late Night Live (LNL), Insiders and online, are bereft. Tingle laughs and says the ABC will be “just fine without me”.“I’ve been very touched by all the people – and lots of people have sent me messages about how much they’ll miss me – and that’s really lovely. I’m overwhelmed. But I am only moving from one area to another at the ABC.”A former political editor of the Australian Financial Review who has spent 40 of her 45 years in journalism covering national affairs, Tingle moves to her new international role mid-year. The ABC will advertise for a replacement. Weekly Beast understands the frontrunner is Jacob Greber, the ABC’s chief digital political correspondent, who has impressed with his sharp analytical skills on the ABC’s Politics Now podcast.Some of Tingle’s fans, who include legendary political commentators Laurie Oakes and Paul Bongiorno, were unimpressed by how the ABC utilised her skills on Saturday night’s somewhat overpopulated election panel.Oakes on X: “The ABC has shoved Laura Tingle so far from the centre of its election panel that she is almost out of sight in the wings. Stupidity!”Bongiorno: “Indeed – it makes you wonder, without doubt [how] La Ti is without peer in political journalism.”Now, the ABC’s election night coverage was a triumph in terms of ratings, serving up the broadcaster’s biggest audience since the new ratings measurement began in 2022. The national total TV average audience (including iview) of 2.3m was bigger than Bluey’s The Sign, which got 2.24m in April last year.But the panel’s make up and the amount of time accorded to Tingle and outgoing numbers guy Antony Green were not universally praised. One panellist, former Liberal party strategist and Guardian Australia podcaster Tony Barry spent the night on ABC TV and then jumped online to say he thought the coverage he was on was “woeful”.His Facebook post was swiftly screenshot and shared widely with journalists on Sunday. “The ABC was the only telecast of six hours of no data, analysis and insight – just six endless ‘what I reckon’ journalism. Unwatchable drivel,” Barry wrote.We understand Barry believed he didn’t get enough screen time, but to be fair to him, some observers agreed that political nerds like Barry, Tingle and Green should have been front and centre, and there may have been too many talking heads.But there was plenty of Tingle boldness on Monday when she told David Marr on LNL that News Corp was irrelevant in terms of influence on Australian elections.“There’s just no correlation between what News Corp says and what voters do, except, you know, for a few old people in grey cardigans somewhere,” Tingle said. “I mean, it’s irrelevant, and I find it extraordinary that people, including other journalists, get so cowered by a bunch of people who are so irrelevant and who have basically dragged the Liberal party and the Nationals into irrelevance as well because they’re trying to suck up to them.”Veteran columnist Niki Savva, who famously quit the Australian and joined the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age after editors told her she had to share a page with Sky News host Peta Credlin, agreed with Tingle’s analysis.“What [the election result] exposed in the end was the absolute irrelevance of Sky After Dark and the News Limited tabloids, and also the Australian,” Savva said on LNL, adding that she didn’t “really subscribe to many of those publications”.Savva said Dutton “got it so wrong” because he “spent so much time in the Sky studios and reading the Australian and not enough time talking to the millions of other people who don’t subscribe to those outlets”.On Friday, News Corp’s global results brought more bad news for the media mogul. Rupert Murdoch’s mastheads in Australia, the US and the UK have suffered a sharp fall in revenue after lower advertising income cut into their revenue streams.For some News Corp commentators, the election result was not an invitation for self-reflection but a time to double down on the Sky News agenda of amplifying the culture wars.Janet Albrechtsen began by saying “everything is about culture”.“Genuine Liberals need to stop trembling about these ‘culture war’ accusations from opponents, inside and outside the party. What kind of country do we want to live in? If Liberals don’t start embracing that, explaining policies through the prism of what kind of culture we want, they may as well fold their tent and save donors a heck of a lot of money.”Credlin urged the party to offer a strong and clear alternative and not “Labor-lite”.“Importantly, the Coalition cannot get spooked by the call from its enemies to ‘drop the culture wars’ because it’s the ‘long march through the institutions’ that’s the reason for the left’s ascendancy.”While the Daily Mail Australia headlines are often amusing, this one from the election caught our eye.“Kooyong election results: Teal doctor Monique Ryan – who doesn’t answer journalists’ questions, has a rogue husband who tears down candidates’ signs – celebrates victory after being pooed on by a bird on election day”. There is a lot going on there.There was nothing unusual about Kerry Stokes’ West Australian newspaper endorsing the Coalition last weekend. But a line in the editorial caught the attention of one of its readers.He thought the editorial, “Anthony Albanese must be punished for a poor three years”, claimed that the newspaper backed Labor last election.“In WA, we backed Mr Albanese in [sic] during the 2022 campaign, in large part because Mark McGowan reassured us that it was the right thing to do, and also because Scott Morrison, despite delivering the GST deal for our state, had let us down and we couldn’t forgive him for it,” the editorial said.The reader pointed out that in the 2022 election, the West’s editorial was headlined “It’s Morrison, but with some crucial caveats” and said, “We believe Australia should stick with a Morrison Government”.We asked editor-in-chief Christopher Dore about the apparent anomaly, and he explained that “in WA” meant the voters in the state and not the newspaper. “The editorial was referring to the people of WA backing Albanese in 2022, not specifically the paper in its editorial,” Dore said.Cartoonist and illustrator John Shakespeare walked away from the Sydney Morning Herald in August after four decades, taking a redundancy package along with 85 of his colleagues from Nine publishing.A kind and humble chap, Shakespeare not only delighted readers with his incisive cartoons but generously provided staffers with a detailed caricature when they left the newsroom. It is a treasured artefact for many former Herald staffers.When he left the building, he drew his own likeness, at the request of Peter FitzSimons, who included it in his column. “As great an artist that he is, he is a better man and has always stood out as a gentle, selfless soul, always with a quiet smile, an endlessly cheery presence in whatever room he entered,” Fitz wrote.But Shakes, as he is known, was not long out the door when he was diagnosed with cancer and has spent much of his retirement in and out of hospital. On Friday, his colleagues and friends are meeting Shakes and his wife Anna-Lisa Backlund in a Sydney pub to tell him how much they love him and to sing his favourite song, Peggy Lee’s Is That All There Is?",

            "content": "A 6km bicycle and pedestrian path that will run along a 100-year-old rail corridor and connect two of Sydney’s most popular waterside walks is set to open later this year.The Minns government said on Friday that the GreenWay – stretching north from the Cooks River in Earlwood through the inner west to the Bay Run on Parramatta River at Iron Cove – was 80% complete.The $60m project will intersect with the south-west Metro line due to be completed in 2026.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said both projects would “revolutionise transport” in the city’s inner west and unite communities that previously lacked connections via walking, cycling or public transport.“This project is confined to inner west, but if you link up these two sections … you’ll see a transformation in the way a lot of Sydneysiders interact with the inner west, the Canterbury region, and then all the way into the city,” Minns said on Friday.“We think this pathway will be a major tourism draw, not just for locals who live in Sydney but also for people from around the world. It’s something extra to do in this great city, and the government’s been very clear in our intention to have more urban consolidation [and] more density.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe project mostly follows the route of the inner west light rail and Hawthorne Canal and has required the construction of underpasses and tunnels beneath major roads to create continuous paths.The Hercules parklands and the New Canterbury Road underpass are the final sections to be completed.Local MP Jo Haylen said the “active transport” corridor connected the Cooks River in the south to the harbour in the north. The GreenWay would allow people to access the Metro at Dulwich Hill station.The finished project will feature parks and foreshores, playgrounds, sporting facilities, bushcare sites, public art, cafes and cultural and historical sites.The Minns government’s housing policy has focused on increasing the density of housing stock around urban centres and transport.Minns said on Friday that required a “world’s best practice” approach to achieve “the kind of density and liveability that you’ve seen in places like Brooklyn and London and Barcelona and Paris”.Sign up to Morning MailOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotion“There’s absolutely no reason why we can’t have people living in tight communities with world-class public transport, great access to bike lanes, wonderful, beautiful, open parks, enjoying the most beautiful city in the world,” he said.The original idea for the GreenWay came from community advocates in the inner west.The Inner West council mayor, Darcy Byrne, said it had been a 20-year vision of the local community. He said the “incredibly exciting” project would transform the way people moved.“We know that kids will use the GreenWay to get to school, either walking or on their bikes, that families will use it recreationally, and it’s also going to be a centre of public art,” he said.“We’re investing in 10 major public artworks right along the length of the GreenWay, which will make this a place that people from all over Sydney want to come and visit.”Darcy added: “Later … the Metro will open and there will be very fast rail running every four minutes. That is going to be truly transformative. It will get people out of their cars and on to their scooters and bikes and walking more as well.”",

            "content": "Australian cricket stars are on the verge of flying home, or to Dubai, as the escalating India-Pakistan conflict threatens to postpone the IPL. Some players based in India could fly back to Australia as soon as Saturday to escape the increasing tension in the country.Six Australians – David Warner, Max Bryant, Riley Meredith, Sean Abbott, Mitch Owen and Ben Dwarshuis – are playing in the Pakistan Super League. PSL organisers have confirmed they are moving the competition, slated to finish on 18 May, to Dubai.“I regret that our domestic audience and cricket lovers will not be able to watch these matches in Pakistan’s stadiums,” Pakistan Cricket Board chair Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement.Friday’s game between Peshawar and Karachi had already been postponed as teams scramble to leave Pakistan. Moving the PSL to Dubai will likely allow the Australians involved to safely continue playing, rather than travelling home.It comes after the Ricky Ponting-coached Punjab Kings’ match against Mitchell Starc’s Delhi was abandoned on Thursday night following a power failure in Dharamsala. The Indian cricket board (BCCI) had already moved the next match in Dharamsala, on Sunday, to Ahmedabad.Airports in Dharamsala and Chandigarh – where the Kings are based – have been closed for civilian and commercial use since Wednesday, while others across India’s northwestern corridor are also out of bounds to the cricketers.Three IPL franchises – Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Rajasthan Royals – are already out of finals contention so that would theoretically make it easier for players to get home.Pacer Nathan Ellis has been restricted to just one game for the Super Kings, while superstars Pat Cummins and Travis Head play for Hyderabad.But title-contending teams such as the Kings, and Josh Hazlewood and Tim David’s Royal Challengers Bengaluru would be reluctant to allow key players to go.“We’re not sure where we’re going at the moment … there’s been some talk about Ahmedabad and some talk about Jaipur,” Kings coach Ponting said during a mid-game interview.Cancelling or postponing the IPL remains a live option. Organisers would likely head to South Africa if they move the tournament, as it wouldn’t be realistic to be in Dubai where the PSL is based.The IPL has been moved out of India before, including during the Covid-19 pandemic.Sign up to The SpinSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionafter newsletter promotionCricket Australia has been across the situation in India and Pakistan since 26 people were killed and 17 were injured in an attack in the Kashmir region late last month.“We continue to closely monitor the situation in Pakistan and India, including obtaining regular advice and updates from the Australian government, the PCB, BCCI and local government authorities, and maintaining communication with our players and support staff currently in the region,” a CA spokesperson said.Despite the volatility of the situation, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia insisted foreign players in the IPL had no concerns about continuing to play.“They are quite comfortable. Everyone in the league is comfortable,” Saikia said.But IPL chairman Arun Dhumal raised the prospect of halting the tournament.“It is on as of now, but obviously it is an evolving situation and any decision will be taken keeping the best interest of all stakeholders in mind,” Dhumal told PTI.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 04:00",
            "content": "Few people get to choose their own nickname. And when a sportsperson is labelled as “The Destroyer”, it could go one of two ways. Michael Storer has carried the weighty moniker since Nico Denz coined the nickname during a celebratory dinner for one of the Australian cyclist’s two stage wins at the 2021 Vuelta a España.Former teammate Denz turned to his native German to find “Der Zestörer” as a nod to Storer riding away to a pair of victories in Spain as much as for the similarities to his surname. Storer backed up his breakout Grand Tour with second place overall in the Tour of the Alps the following year, but had to wait longer before impressing again in a three-week race.A top-10 finish in last year’s Giro d’Italia was the first sign that Storer might be a general classification challenger in the making. An overall triumph in the Tour of the Alps last month now has the 28-year-old being spoken about as one of the leading GC contenders when the Giro starts in Albania on Friday.“The Destroyer … yeah, that is my main nickname, at least in the cycling world,” Storer says. “When I’m in my best shape, I can live up to it. Like in the Tour of the Alps, I think I lived up to that nickname, and hopefully I can in some more races this year. But Grand Tours are a lot about following, there aren’t too many riders blowing the rest of the peloton away.”Storer looked to be in the form of his life at the Tour of the Alps as he launched solo attacks on three of the five stages, each in different circumstances. The early move on stage two went a long way to setting up Storer’s overall victory, but he still had to dig deep to defend the leader’s jersey on the penultimate stage and finally reclaim the lead the next day. Ineos Grenadiers’ Thymen Arensman was the only rider able to keep pace with Storer on the GC, but the Australian is confident he kept enough in reserve to still have the legs to ride out three weeks at a higher level.This year’s Giro will be missing defending champion Tadej Pogacar but even the absence of the dominant rider of our time is not quite enough to throw the race wide open. Pogacar’s UAE Team Emirates teammate Juan Ayuso will also bring strong form to Albania and then Italy, while 2023 winner Primoz Roglic is the heavy favourite to claim his second maglia rosa for Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe.Storer will be riding the Giro for the third time and his second since joining Tudor Pro Cycling ahead of last season. While a 10th place finish last year and recent success in the mountains will ensure he won’t fly under the radar, let alone ghost into a high finish, Storer is backing himself to make the most of his climbing legs while aiming to “minimise losses” in the two individual time trials.“I’m feeling really good about the Giro because I’ve held really strong fitness since January and then been slowly building on that,” says Storer, who first showed form this season when winning a stage and finishing fourth overall at Paris-Nice in March. “I’ve hit a good level and then just scraped away at those extra marginal gains. I’ve had a really smooth run up until now.“I want to target the general classification again but I’d also like to win a stage at the Giro. If I’m really, really good, I can win that from the peloton, otherwise it’ll need to be from a breakaway. Either way, I’ll get something out of the race. Hopefully I can keep up with Roglic and Ayuso, that would be a really good start.”Sign up to Australia SportGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskafter newsletter promotionOne of Storer’s old friends will be working against him in the mountains, with fellow Western Australian and 2022 Giro winner Jai Hindley riding in support of Roglic. Hindley has not been back on the podium of a three-week race since finishing runner-up at the 2020 Giro, then becoming the second Australian to win a Grand Tour two years later. The pair of climbers will be among as many as 13 Australians on the start line of the Giro this year, with sprinter Kaden Groves out to add to his eight Grand Tour stage wins and Jay Vine back in form with third place at the Tour de Romandie.“I saw how Jai won the Giro, which is a very clever way to do it, just stay second and hunt GC in the last week,” Storer says with a laugh. “You don’t have to have responsibility for the pink jersey the whole way, just at the end. I’ve known Jai for ages, since I was 12 years old, and he lives 30kms from my place here [in Italy]. We still go for a couple of training rides together.”Storer has lived near the mountains of northern Italy for five years after first joining the world tour with Team Sunweb in 2018 and later spending two seasons with Groupama FDJ. While he doesn’t meet up with Hindley as often as they would like, there are enough riders nearby to keep Storer company and he enjoys coming across “strong local amateurs” when he is on what he calls an easy day. A familiarity with the Italian terrain and budding links to the locals has made the Giro the “dream race” for Storer.“It’s the culture around the race that I like, the vibe is really special,” Storer says. “It’s like real cycling. It’s not like at the Tour [de France] where it’s really international and you get people that aren’t really into cycling going to watch. The Giro is authentic. It still feels like something real.”",

Fragar then spent three months in the studio painting.Williams did not seen the portrait until Friday, with Fragar describing her as “an incredibly trusting subject”.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“The way I start to make paintings of someone is to get an energy from them, and Justene’s energy is the energy of a conjurer,” she said.Asked if she would ever return the favour and paint Fragar, Williams told Guardian Australia: “I can’t paint. I could make a sculpture, perhaps … or I would invite Julie into a performance with me.”Of her win, Fragar said: “Visual arts careers have many ups and downs so, after 20 years of practice, one learns not to be too hopeful about these things. And as somebody who’s judged a lot of prizes too, I know things can go either way. There’s many works in this show that could have won.”The Archibald, Australia’s most prestigious portraiture prize, is awarded to the best portrait of a person “distinguished in art, letters, science or politics” painted by an Australian resident, and has been running since 1921.Alongside the Archibald, the $50,000 Wynne prize for landscape painting and figurative sculpture was also awarded on Friday, to Jude Rae for her painting Pre-dawn Sky over Port Botany Container Terminal.The Sydney artist, who has been a three-time Wynne finalist, said the painting depicted “what I see from my bathroom window, four flights up from Redfern Hill” – looking towards Sydney’s Botany Bay, the geographical birthplace of colonial Australia, on a sightline that was once the corridor used by Aboriginal people to access the bay.“I see the lights of the container terminal blazing away 24/7, looking very small beneath the vastness of the sky,” Rae said, accepting her prize.Sign up to Saved for LaterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsafter newsletter promotionThe $40,000 Sulman prize for genre, subject and mural painting, went to Gene A’Hern for Sky Painting. The artist, who hails from Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, used oil and oil stick on board for the work, which he said was “about home and place”.A record 2,394 entries were received across the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes this year, with more than 70% of finalists across the three awards being female artists.More than a third of this year’s 57 Archibald finalists were painted by first-time nominees.Celebrity sitters were a minority; instead, artists dominated as subjects, with a dozen finalists being self-portraits and 22 being portraits of another artist.Last week the artist Abdul Abdullah won the $3,000 packing room prize category – decided by the AGNSW staff who hang the paintings each year – for his portrait of artist Jason Phu, also a finalist this year.Abdullah’s playful painting, titled No mountain high enough, depicted Phu sitting astride a horse.The Archibald, Wynne and Sulman finalists’ paintings all go on public display at the AGNSW from Saturday until 17 August.The Archibald works will then head to Geelong, Gosford, Muswellbrook, Mudgee, Shoalhaven and Coffs Harbour later this year and in 2026.",

            "content": "For the first time in 42 years, critically endangered helmeted honeyeaters have returned to Cardinia in south-east Victoria, where they were found until the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983.Helmeted honeyeaters are charismatic, energetic and curious, according to Dr Kim Miller, the manager of threatened species at Healesville sanctuary.Even though the birds can be quite territorial, they’re social and will shake their gold and black feathers in “a really beautiful greeting to each other”.Twenty-one birds captive-bred at the sanctuary were released into forest on Bunurong country where researchers will monitor them to see if they breed and can establish themselves as a new wild population.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“The location at Cardinia has some really good habitat features that helmeted honeyeaters require,” said Miller, who has worked with the species for a decade.“It has the right vegetation structure and some of the food plants that they need. That combination is hard to come by.”Fewer than 250 helmeted honeyeaters remain in the world. Miller said 99% of the species’ habitat had been wiped out across its range and genetic diversity was a problem because the remaining wild birds were incredibly isolated.Sign up to Clear Air AustraliaAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisafter newsletter promotionOne remnant wild population can be found at Yellingbo nature conservation reserve in the Upper Yarra Valley. A second wild population is found at Yarra Ranges national park, where scientists working with the decades-long conservation breeding program began releasing birds in 2021.The program has been releasing birds every year since 1995, mostly to boost numbers at Yellingbo. A couple of populations introduced at other sites have been unsuccessful.“Releasing species into new locations, there’s no guarantee of success,” Miller said. “The recovery team has been working really hard for more than a decade in finding suitable sites that can support a population of helmeted honeyeaters.”Miller said researchers planned to release more birds at the Cardinia site over the next few years to try to increase their numbers and genetic diversity.A radio transmitter has been attached to each of the birds for temporary tracking. Miller said it would fall off after a few weeks, after which each bird would be monitored over the long term via the unique leg bands they had been fitted with.Zoos Victoria’s helmeted honeyeater field officer, Dr Nick Bradsworth, is at the site to feed and monitor the birds for the first few weeks.“To see them flying around and squabbling with each other where they would have been doing this over 40 years ago, it feels like the right thing,” he said.“This is just the start. We are just going to keep building from here. Hopefully we can create even more populations throughout eastern Victoria through their former range, so our bird faunal emblem can thrive for years to come.”",

            "content": "Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch!Another Australian election has come and gone in a flurry of maps, virtual parliaments and an animated dunk tank for losing candidates.In this week’s newsletter we’ll have all our favourite election visuals and a renewables explainer, as well as visualisations of the Met Gala and earthquakes in Myanmar from international outlets that decided not to go all-in on our election.This election has seen a bunch of surprises across the country, and there are lots of ways to slice and dice the – still unfinalised – results. Australia’s preferential system, and redrawn boundaries for some seats, can make it hard to get your head around exactly what happened.This map-based story from our colleague Andy Ball takes the election right back to basics – plotting the first preference vote at every booth.There are also maps to compare electorates and areas between the 2022 and 2025 elections, so you can see exactly where the swings were.The data team have put together a bunch of other election visuals you should bookmark and check out, including our complete results page and this updating page of the count and swing in undecided seats.This election also saw the continuation of the long-term decline in the major party vote. Nick and Andy put together this deep dive just before election day.We don’t have full preference flow data yet for this election, but Josh created an interactive of how preferences flowed at the last one to illustrate why it’s important – and how it works.1. You get a chart. And you get a chart. Everyone gets a chartIt was hard to pick from the many great visuals in the ABC’s explainer about how renewables fit in the energy system, which also covers what the national energy market is, why and how the market has evolved over time and how pumped hydro works.This is probably a story to sit with for a while. We went over it a second time to write this newsletter and learned even more. Shoutout to the little graphic on why so much solar potential is wasted.2. Bigger and bolderAs has been repeatedly covered in this newsletter, we aren’t fashionistas. But even for us, the Met Gala is hard to ignore. Here’s Reuters with a very creative way of illustrating how the looks have become bigger.If you check the methodology at the end, it sounds like this was largely done manually – by tracing hundreds of photos of celebrity outfits. Fantastic.Sign up to The CrunchOur data journalists showcase the most important charts and dataviz from the Guardian and around the web, free every fortnightafter newsletter promotion3. A top-down view of a top-down viewFirefighting aircraft can seem ever-present during Australian summers. But from the ground, it’s hard to conceptualise what’s really going on. This visual story from the Age and Sydney Morning Herald, about efforts over the Grampians this summer, really makes you appreciate how much goes into fighting a fire from the air.The combination of the spot fire indication and the flight paths is great.4. Why Myanmar’s earthquake was so devastatingAnother beautiful if horrific story from Reuters, illustrating how big the “supershear” was in the earthquake that hit Myanmar in March.There’s a lot of putting things in perspective in this story. Millions of people have been affected by the quake in Myanmar, from a rupture that is longer than Sri Lanka.We’re focused on the Australian election this week, so this great New York Times tariff visualisation, and a bunch of other incredible stories unfortunately don’t make the cut.It is a truth universally acknowledged that there should be more triangles in datavis. So please enjoy the ABC’s ternary scatterplot showing the rise of the independent vote in Australia.We really liked this Sydney Morning Herald explainer on how preferential voting works.We took a look at what went wrong for the Coalition, with some charts.And the ABC made a Big Scrolly showing how Labor won and where.We’re going to end this packed edition of The Crunch on what is undoubtedly a high note: after 500 days, Valerie the dachshund has been found and reunited with her owners.

            "content": "Labor could hardly be considered a metaphorical David in most federal election contests. But in the progressive seat of Melbourne, where the now-beaten Greens leader Adam Bandt had reigned for 15 years, there are similarities to the oft-told biblical story.On 28 March, when Anthony Albanese called an election date for May, Melbourne appeared on no one’s list as a battle to watch.Just five months before the campaign began, Labor’s candidate against Bandt, Sarah Witty, had unsuccessfully run for a seat on Yarra city council. She came third behind independent and Greens candidates.By February, less than two months from polling day, Witty was Labor’s choice to run in Melbourne against the long-serving Greens MP.From the outset, the seat wasn’t on federal Labor’s radar. “I don’t think we even had it in the winnable column,” a Victorian Labor source said.A Greens insider said there had been no indication Melbourne was in trouble, noting the party didn’t have the resources for single-seat polling in the way the major parties do.Both the Greens and Labor will reflect on the unexpected result in the coming weeks to figure out what happened.For the Greens, it will be a sobering look at how Bandt, regarded as a unifying leader within the party, lost the seat he had held for so long.Local Labor volunteers from the Melbourne and Richmond branches were out on the hustings daily. Even Witty’s social media was run by a volunteer, who updated the page in their free time.How-to-vote cards were supplied by the national campaign but rank-and-file members had to fundraise through raffles and auctions to pay for campaign shirts and corflutes.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailA senior Victorian Labor source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described Witty’s campaign as “run on the smell of an oily rag”, with donations from the active Melbourne and Richmond branches.Another Labor source, who helped the campaign, said: “It was a very, very sparsely funded campaign, all raised from locals. It wasn’t like there were massive amounts of money coming from a national office.”The idea of Labor as David in a battle against the Greens Goliath doesn’t sit well with the Greens camp. They argue that Labor’s federal megaphone gives even the most under-resourced campaigns a big chance.While the “people-powered” campaign is credited by Labor sources as the reason Witty ousted Bandt, a “perfect storm” had also hit.The Greens leader’s chance of winning a sixth term in office was dampened by three key factors, the electoral analyst Kevin Bonham said.The electoral boundaries for the seat shifted before the election, lowering Bandt’s primary vote from 49.6% in 2022 to 44.7%. On a two-candidate preferred basis, it had dropped from 60.2% to 56.5%.After days of tense post-election vote counting, Bandt on Thursday conceded to Witty, saying a Greens win in Melbourne was like “climbing Everest”.“We needed to overcome Liberal, Labor and One Nation combined, and it’s an Everest that we’ve climbed a few times now, but this time we fell just short,” he said.Bonham said preference flows had not favoured the Greens this time around.More Liberal and One Nation votes went to Labor than previously.The rightwing activist group Advance ran a campaign against the Greens to reduce its vote in both houses, claiming Bandt’s defeat as a win.Social media advertising analysis showed the group had spent no money on targeted ads in the seat during the campaign.Advance disputes the data that no money was spent on geo-targeted advertising in Melbourne, adding they spent a similar amount there as other Greens-held seats.A source inside Bandt’s camp said a post-election review would look at third-party campaigns against the party to understand their impact on the inner-city seat.Bonham said another factor against Bandt couldn’t be written off as easily: the Greens leader’s primary vote dipped just enough, even after the boundary redistribution, to set the wheels in motion for his loss.“It’s a perfect storm,” he said. “He had a lower baseline, he had a swing against him on the primary vote, and he had a swing against him on preferences.“Those three things combined have got rid of him.”Swings against Bandt in progressive booths, including Fitzroy and Collingwood, will require further analysis to determine how the Greens came undone in the lower house.A Victorian Labor source from the left faction hoped the Greens “looked critically” at their failings.“I really do see the value of having strong leftwing crossbenchers in the parliament,” they said. “I think it’s good for democracy, and I think it’s really good for the Labor party when we do have a viable leftwing minor party.“So I really hope that they take some time to critically look at their failings.”",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 02:41",
            "content": "Melbourne florist Jane Marx, founder of same-day delivery service The Beautiful Bunch, is preparing to send more than 1,000 bouquets this Mother’s Day. Each artfully wrapped arrangement – pastel-toned sweet pea, peachy tulips – will come from farms in Victoria. “Because the best flowers are the ones grown closest to you,” she says.“We’re lucky enough to have a lot of variety in Victoria,” Marx says. “Our customers trust that whatever we’re putting into our arrangements is the best of the season, but unfortunately that’s not reflected more broadly in the flower consumer market.”It’s estimated only 50% of flowers bought in Australia are grown here, according to Flower Industry Australia. Chief executive Anna Jabour says that percentage shifts again during peak times. “There’s an influx of imported flowers, mainly because major supermarkets purchase a significant amount of imported flowers for periods such as Mother’s Day,” she says.While not all flowers sold at supermarkets are imported, Jabour says there is no mandatory country of origin labelling for cut flowers in Australia. This makes it difficult for customers to make an informed choice. “We think that if the community realises not all flowers are grown here, they will choose Australian grown,” she says.Although flowers are an expensive purchase – with bunches often retailing for more than $100 – florists say they’re frequently an impulse buy. This means shoppers don’t always make informed decisions about quality.Flowers are imported to meet year-round demand for popular varieties such as roses, which are usually brought in from Colombia and Ecuador.Imports aren’t necessarily cheaper, and carry additional costs. There is a quality cost, as they’ve undergone fumigation and other chemical treatments, says Jabour. “Flowers that are imported into Australia are fumigated with methyl bromide and they’re dipped in glyphosate,” she says. Flowers grown overseas also carry an environmental cost, as they’ve travelled by plane or ship, and a social cost, due to poorer labour conditions of workers.Sydney florist Sarah Regan, who runs same-day delivery service Little Flowers, is committed to selling 95% Australian grown flowers for those reasons. “With local flowers, you get better quality, better freshness, no transit times and less environmental impact,” she says.“We consider imports to be an absolute last resort. I think customers don’t necessarily think about it proactively, but they do care once they know,” she says. “It’s part of our responsibility as business owners to help educate people – in a nice way.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe Beautiful Bunch, which employs women from refugee backgrounds, has a commitment to selling 95% Australian grown flowers too. “We have social impact embedded into the work we do, so buying imported is not a good fit,” Marx says.Janae Paquin-Bowden, who runs a micro flower farm, Fleurs de Lyonville, in Victoria’s Macedon Ranges region with her husband, Chris, has noticed this shift. “At the Melbourne farmers market, we have florists now coming to us to say they only [buy] Australian grown flowers. We didn’t have that 10 years ago.”Hydrangeas, tulips, poppies and sunflowers are some of the Australian-grown flowers in season this Mother’s Day, says Jabour. “They’re really beautiful flowers with a lot of character.”“Visit your local florists and specifically ask for Australian grown flowers,” she says. “And avoid the supermarkets.”For an affordable alternative, seek out local growers at farmers markets and ask for what’s in season.Chrysanthemums naturally bloom before Mother’s Day, which is why they’re closely associated with the date. That and they contain the word “mum”. “April-May is their natural flowering period, so it’s easy to grow them at this time of year,” says third-generation grower Aldo Vumbaca, who only grows chrysanthemums.Vumbaca says white is their most popular colour, followed by pinks and pastels. Recently, florists have also been asking for “autumn colours – oranges and browns and sunset colours,” he says.At Little Flowers, Regan sells mix bouquets of stems bought that morning from her network of growers at Sydney flower market. “I’m buying from people who’ve worked on flower farms for generations. There’s mud in the bucket. Weathered hands. I think there’s just a magic to it.”She also sells abundant seasonal flowers en masse – such as elegant tulips from Victoria, bushels of bright sunflowers grown in NSW’s Southern Highlands, and ruffly stock from Sydney, known for its distinctive mustardy scent.“The first thing you do is bury your nose in them once you’ve received flowers,” says Marx, who is also selling sweet peas, local roses, marigolds and orange banksia this Mother’s Day.“Often flowers that have been imported and treated don’t have a scent,” says Chris Paquin-Bowden.Vumbaca says he’s not totally against imported flowers, but notes they have longevity issues. “You’re battling to get three days out of an imported one,” he says. Based 35 minutes from Sydney flower markets, his company, Commercial Flowers, can cut and sell flowers within a day. “We virtually guarantee anything up to three weeks’ vase life on our crissies.”If you’re buying in season, local cut flowers will typically last around a week, says Marx. “It’s going to be a superior product; the vase life from tulips, for example, are significant, because they’re in season. We’re selling tulips en masse, not roses en masse, because that’s what we can get a lot of at the moment.”The best thing customers can do, she says, is support florists that buy locally. Second to that: “Look at the most delicate flowers – such as sweet pea, stock, violet – as they’re almost impossible to import,” she says.“Look at what you can’t imagine would survive on a plane,” Marx suggests. “Also, if it’s not growing on your street, it’s probably been imported.”",

            "content": "“No More Trans @ DoD,” Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, posted after the supreme court allowed the Trump administration’s ousting of transgender troops to go forward. As of Thursday, the orders have been issued to identify and involuntarily force trans people out of service.Department officials have said it is difficult to determine exactly how many transgender service members there are, but medical records will show those who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, show symptoms or are being treated. Those troops would then be forced out.Separately, Britain has become the first country to strike a trade agreement with Donald Trump since his announcement of global tariffs on what he called “liberation day”.Here are the key stories at a glance:The Pentagon will immediately begin moving as many as 1,000 service members who identify as transgender out of the military and give others 30 days to self-identify, under a new directive issued on Thursday.Buoyed up by Tuesday’s supreme court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on transgender individuals in the military, the defense department will then begin going through medical records to identify others who have not come forward.Read the full storyThe UK and US have agreed a “breakthrough” trade agreement slashing some of Donald Trump’s tariffs on cars, aluminium and steel. The UK prime minister said the deal would save thousands of British jobs.Keir Starmer said it was a “fantastic, historic day” as he announced the agreement, the first by the White House since Trump announced sweeping global tariffs last month.Read the full storyJD Vance has said that the US will not intervene in the conflict between Pakistan and India, calling fighting between the two nuclear powers “fundamentally none of our business”.The remarks came during an interview with Fox News, where the US vice-president said that the US would seek to de-escalate the conflict but could force neither side to “lay down their arms”.“Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict,” Vance said. “Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen.”Read the full storyDonald Trump on Thursday said he would look for a new candidate for the role of top federal prosecutor in Washington DC, after a key Republican senator said he would not support the loyalist initially selected for the job.He then named Fox News host and former judge Jeanine Pirro for the job.Read the full storyRepublicans in the House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation to codify Donald Trump’s policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”. The measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene and passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favour.Read the full storyThe Trump administration is invoking the “state secrets privilege” in an apparent attempt to avoid answering a judge’s questions about its erroneous deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García to El Salvador.Read the full storyTrump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters that British consumers will like chicken and beef imported from the US despite the use of chlorine and hormones. “Let’s see what the market decides,” Navarro said, adding: “We don’t believe that once they taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.”The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) will no longer track the cost of climate crisis-fuelled weather disasters, including floods, heatwaves, wildfires and more. It is the latest example of changes to the agency and the Trump administration limiting federal government resources on climate change.Catching up? Here’s what happened on 7 May.",

            "content": "The Pentagon is removing the 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as trans, and giving those who have yet to openly identify as transgender 30 days to remove themselves, according to a new directive issued on Thursday.The memo is fueled by Tuesday’s supreme court decision allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on trans military members. The defense department has said it will follow up by going through medical records to identify others who have not come forward.Officials have said that as of 9 December 2024, there were 4,240 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria in active duty, national guard and reserve service, representing a tiny fraction – of the 2 million people in service, although they acknowledge the number may be higher.The memo released on Thursday mirrors one sent out in February, but any action was stalled at that point by several lawsuits. When the initial Pentagon directive came out earlier this year, it gave service members 30 days to self-identify. Since then, about 1,000 have done so.In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said the 1,000 troops who already self-identified “will begin the voluntary separation process” from the military.Rae Timberlake, a spokesperson for Sparta Pride, is one of the 1,000 who chose to self-identify. Timberlake has served in the navy for 17 years and said that trans service members who do not take the current buyout offer could lose out on benefits that took years of service to build.“There’s no guarantee to access to your pension or severance or an honorable discharge,” Timberlake said.Despite Timberlake’s decision to leave, they said many trans troops would continue serving if allowed to.“This is not voluntary. This is a decision that folks are coming to under duress,” Timberlake said. “These are 1,000 transgender troops that would be serving if the conditions were not created to force them into making a decision for their own wellbeing, or the wellbeing of their family long-term.”The move is the latest by the Trump administration taking aim at trans members of the military and trans veterans. After Trump took office and issued a flurry of gender-focused executive orders, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) started cracking down on healthcare for LGBTQ+ veterans, starting with the rescinding of VA directive 1341, thereby phasing out treatments for gender dysphoria.The expulsion of trans service members comes in tandem with the past views of the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, that women are not suited for combat roles, at a time when military recruitment is profoundly struggling and veterans have voiced concerns that potential Veterans Administration cuts could further hinder young Americans from enlisting.Announcing the removals on Thursday, Hegseth doubled down on his hardline approach. “We are leaving WOKENESS AND WEAKNESS behind. No more pronouns,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X on Thursday. “We are done with that sh*t.”",

            "content": "As white smoke billowed from the Vatican in Rome, yellow papal flags whipped in the crisp Lake Michigan breeze in front of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Academy on Chicago’s North Side.Screams of “Habemus Papam!” echoed throughout the cafeteria at the Catholic school on Thursday afternoon, when news broke that Chicago’s Robert Prevost had become Pope Leo XIV.Prevost was born on Chicago’s South Side and attended Catholic school at St Mary of the Assumption, a now defunct parish on the city’s far south-east side. Prevost studied divinity at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood, and taught at a local Catholic high school, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.Although he spent many years in Peru, where he worked as a missionary and later archbishop of Chiclayo, Chicagoans celebrated their native son at churches and schools around the city.Seventh-grader Vincent Wall and eighth-grader Ava Broz were in the cafeteria at Mount Carmel, where students were waving US and city of Chicago flags.“It really feels like a 2016 Cubs World Series,” said Wall, referring to the baseball team that endured a long drought before a triumphant victory in 2016. “It’s just like, a pope from Chicago is just global, and so is the World Series. It’s crazy.”Allison Foerster, who teaches Spanish and religion at the school, was getting lunch when she saw students climbing on their desks to take a look at the computer screen playing a live feed of the white smoke. She found out the pope’s identity while monitoring recess.“I’m supervising the kids playing soccer and then there’s five [of them] over my shoulder trying to watch,” said Foerster, who played the news on her phone.On Tuesday, Wall and Broz participated as narrators in a mock conclave at Mount Carmel. Younger students dressed in scarlet robes and paper hats filed into a makeshift Sistine Chapel, the school’s auditorium, and discussed the qualifications for the next pope over snacks. The small cardinals were even flanked by a mini Swiss Guard, dressed in a suit that teacher Dominic Moretti had ordered from Italy.“So they knew [today] was a moment of joy and a moment of celebration,” says Foerster.Like Boston, Chicago boasts one of the strongest Catholic contingents in the United States. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Poland and Italy formed vibrant parishes. Today, church spires are as prevalent in Chicago’s urban landscape as art deco motifs and skyscrapers.Chicago’s Catholic community has faced many of the same headwinds the church has weathered across the US. In 2022, the Chicago archdiocese unveiled plans to slash its number of parishes by 123. Financial pressures, fewer priests and dwindling mass attendance pushed the diocese to consolidate. This March, data from Pew showed a 12% drop in the number of Chicagoans who identify as Christian, compared with data from a decade ago.Meanwhile, the church’s continued battle with sexual abuse scandals comes at a time when secularism is on the rise in America.But throughout the city on Thursday, the news of a hometown pope had people in high spirits. Ragen Eggert, a worker at the local hotdog stand the Wiener’s Circle, joked with patrons. “It’s officially a sin to have ketchup on a hotdog,” she said, a nod to the city’s famous Chicago-style recipe.At Holy Name Cathedral, the imposing Gothic Revival church that rose out of the ashes of the Great Chicago fire of 1871, tourists and locals stopped to pray and to honor the new pope. Attenders were buoyed by the news it would be an American, who they believed would continue Pope Francis’s progressive vision for the church.Janet Fink, a parishioner at Holy Name, was optimistic that Leo would follow in Francis’s footsteps.“I loved that he [Francis] just embraced everyone, especially the poor and downtrodden, and he was a people’s pope,” she said. “I hope Pope Leo continues to be the people’s pope.”Fink added that she was shocked to see not only a pope from Chicago, but one from the United States. Leo was widely considered a dark-horse candidate before the conclave, given a historical bias against choosing a pope from the United States.“It’s just amazing. I didn’t think I would see it in my lifetime. It’s a wonderful surprise,” Fink said. “I think they’re [the church] listening to the lay people and I think they want to progress and not go backwards.”Young adult Catholics at Holy Name expressed exuberance. Clara Downey, a 24-year-old PhD student at Loyola University and a biographer for a cardinal, had been waking up at 3.30am each morning waiting for news from the Vatican. Downey acknowledged that Leo is more moderate than Pope Francis. But she noted that Francis must have had confidence in him, since he appointed him as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, which supervises the selection of new bishops.“Wonderful news that it is Bob Prevost. He’s a wonderful man, great pick,” Downey said. “It is, I think, indicative that the college [of cardinals] is looking to not rupture much from where Francis is taking the church.”Like Francis, Leo is quickly following in predecessor’s footsteps as the most meme-able pontiff, at least in the Chicago area.“I already saw somebody post an AI image of him with a bottle of Malört,” Downey said, referring to the bitter wormwood liquor popular in Chicago.For some agnostics, Pope Leo’s announcement was a call back to the church.Kara Baekey, who was visiting Chicago for her daughter Charlotte’s graduation from Loyola, said their family was not religious but was following the conclave and appreciated Pope Francis’s ideologies. The news felt personal to Baekey, whose parents met in Chicago, and signaled hope in a time of political uncertainty in the US. She wanted to find a Catholic church where she could pray for her country, adding that she was concerned about the “atrocities” Donald Trump is bringing.“I feel like it’s kind of magical to be here in Chicago today,” Baekey said. “I hope that this pope will help to take our country on the correct path.”",

            "content": "Donald Trump after a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for “ideally, a 30-day unconditional ceasefire”. “If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,” Trump posted. Zelenskyy said after the call on Thursday that he told Trump that Ukraine was ready for talks on the war with Russia “in any format” but first “Russia must show that it is serious about ending the war, starting with a full and unconditional ceasefire”.The call between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday went “very well”, said a senior Ukrainian official. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes and focused on diplomacy and the genuine ceasefire that the US and Ukraine are trying to establish, while the presidents also discussed the Ukraine-US minerals deal, ratified on Thursday by the Ukrainian parliament.Ukraine has accused Russia of violating Vladimir Putin’s self-declared ceasefire 734 times within its first 12 hours. Kyiv’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called it a “farce”. The Russian president’s unagreed ceasefire aims to protect parades and other proceedings on Russia’s biggest secular holiday, the 80th anniversary of victory over Germany in the second world war.In its opening hours, Russian bombs struck north-east Ukraine, killing at least one civilian, said Ukrainian officials who added that artillery assaults took place across the 1,000km (620 mile) frontline, although with less intensity than in the previous 24 hours. Russia carried out 63 assaults along the frontline. Attacks took place near Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. Large-scale missile and drone attacks abated for a short time, the Ukrainian air force said. But Russian forces fired a missile in central Ukraine’s Poltava region, a top regional official said, damaging roofs of houses when air defences brought it down.The Russian defence Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of attacking its positions and said Russian forces would continue to “mirror” Ukraine’s actions during the Kremlin’s ceasefire. The Russian regions of Belgorod, Lipetsk, Orenburg, Ryazan and Tambov issued drone alerts, but there were no reports of any drones being shot down or intercepted. Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia briefly imposed restrictions on flights to and from the airport in Nizhny Novgorod.Reuters journalists with a Ukrainian drone unit near the front in eastern Ukraine said a Russian infantry raiding party tried to advance on Thursday, but was stopped by drones. “The infantry are still coming,” said one of the soldiers in the unit, a 33-year-old who identified himself by his callsign Mikha. A second person who identified himself as Nazar said in the six hours since the Russian ceasefire started there had been three strikes on his section of the front: “The facts speak for themselves.”Germany said Trump voiced support for European efforts to end the Ukraine war in a first phone call with the new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz. A German statement said: “Trump said he would strongly support Germany’s efforts, together with France, Great Britain, Poland and other European partners, to achieve lasting peace.” Merz assured Zelenskyy of his support and remained open to arming Ukraine with Germany’s Taurus cruise missiles, which the previous chancellor, Olaf Scholz, refused to do.Britain has announced further sanctions targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, said his government was sanctioning up to 100 tankers responsible for carrying more than $24bn worth of cargo since the start of 2024. The UK also said the ships are damaging critical subsea cables in Europe.Starmer is due to attend a meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) in Oslo on Friday where Ukraine and Arctic security are on the agenda. The British-led military alliance is expected to announce further support for Ukraine’s armed forces including intensive training exercises and efforts to counter disinformation. The JEF consists of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as the UK.",

            "content": "A shift toward nuclear power and a significant expansion of gas electricity would have stalled renewable energy investment at the worst possible time, potentially derailing Australia’s transition to a clean, modern energy system. This election was not just a political moment, it was a turning point.This result might offer a much-needed shot in the arm for the clean energy sector, but this is no time for self-congratulation or complacency. Australia’s energy transformation is happening in country towns and centres right around the nation with windfarms, solar projects, battery installations and the transmission lines that connect them being built in regional and rural communities. These communities have legitimate concerns. While the benefits from the jobs, investment, upgraded roads and bridges will come, they also bear the brunt of change. It is our responsibility as an industry to do better by them.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThat begins with honesty. We must acknowledge that renewable energy companies have not always engaged regional communities as well as they should have. While these companies contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to local benefit schemes, pay landholders and neighbours, and partner with councils, we must go further. Token consultation is not enough. We need genuine, sustained, two-way relationships built on respect, transparency and trust. The vast majority of renewable energy companies already do this to the highest of standards, but there are those few that don’t treat regional communities as they should.The responsibility for the sector is creating local jobs, prioritising local businesses and exploring ownership models that give communities a meaningful stake in projects. It means engaging early and respectfully with First Nations peoples and being transparent about the impacts of renewable developments while ensuring benefits flow fairly to the people who host them.This approach isn’t just about fairness, it’s essential to our success. Without social licence in the regions, the energy transition will slow down or fracture. With it, we can build a system that is not only cleaner and more reliable, but also more equitable.The federal government has set an ambitious target of 82% renewable energy by 2030. Reaching that target will be challenging, but it’s achievable. And now, with a clear political mandate, the investment community can proceed with renewed confidence. One important tool at the government’s disposal is the capacity investment scheme, which helps de-risk projects and provide the certainty investors need to back renewable generation and storage. It’s the bridge we need to transition smoothly as ageing coal-fired power stations exit the system.Sign up to Afternoon UpdateOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionTo ensure a stable and reliable grid, energy storage must become a top infrastructure priority. Batteries are the unsung heroes, capturing surplus solar and wind energy when generation is high and releasing it when demand peaks. Australia is already a global leader in large-scale battery deployment, with flagship projects such as the Waratah Super Battery in the Hunter Valley and Tesla’s Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia proving that batteries can maintain grid stability and prevent blackouts. But we need many more of them, and quickly, as well as longer duration storage technologies and pumped-hydro.We must also learn from the experiences of other countries. In Spain and Portugal, underinvestment in storage and poor planning have led to grid instability and economic consequences. Australia cannot afford to make the same mistakes. Every additional megawatt of storage brings us closer to a zero-emissions energy system that is not only clean but dependable.Australians have spoken with clarity. We want a renewable-powered future backed by storage and pumped-hydro and supported, when necessary, by gas. Nuclear power is too slow, too expensive, too divisive and that debate has been settled at the ballot box. Still, achieving our clean energy goals will take more than policy and investment. It requires humility from the sector, collaboration across all levels of government and a genuine commitment to partnering with regional Australia.The mandate is clear. Now, we must rise to meet it. Kane Thornton is the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council. He will step down from the role on 1 August",

            "content": "Maybe the new action movie Shadow Force is just deserts for film fans who complain when seemingly surefire big-screen hits such as Another Simple Favor debut as streaming-only releases. Shadow Force has a premise almost comically adherent to the fixations of so many big-budget streaming movies: elite operatives Kyrah (Kerry Washington) and Isaac (Omar Sy) must fight for their lives and their family when they defy the rules of their, yes, shadowy employers by falling in love and having a child. It shares familiar components including charismatic stars, spy action, domestic strife and semi-slapstick violence with projects such as Back in Action (Netflix), Role Play (Prime Video) and Ghosted (Apple TV+), among others. With director Joe Carnahan, it even has a once edgy stylist who used to deal in gritty grain, blown-out color and quick-cut aesthetics, now following in the footsteps of fellow 2000s-era action directors such as McG and Antoine Fuqua by eliminating all traces of color from his work – another streaming trademark. Somehow, it is nonetheless premiering in movie theaters.This change of venue should be doing Shadow Force a great service. No action picture worth its salt will play better on a smaller screen. But blown up to theater size, Shadow Force doesn’t look any more epic or exciting. It’s working from such a greyish and muted color palette that when enemy combatants throw smoke bombs in order to conceal their attacks, you might find yourself thinking: what’s the difference, really? The whole movie looks like it’s waiting for smoke to clear.The story is mired in murk, too. Though the most obvious reference points are the bad action movies available on every streaming service, the movie also rips off large chunks of Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill, without that movie’s heightened, alternate-reality style: Washington’s lady badass finds out she’s pregnant and eventually faces the wrath of her former co-workers. She’s even the ex-paramour of big boss Jack (Mark Strong). That’s just the backstory; the movie begins in earnest with Isaac, also in a hidden Shadow Force retirement, caring for his cute son Ky (Jahleel Kamara).These early scenes between Sy and Kamara are sweetly played, but it’s never really clear what their day-to-day life entails. How does Isaac stay under the radar with his former employers? The movie’s big idea is that Isaac and Ky’s peaceful life has been enabled by Kyrah separating from her family, but both parents worked for an organization omniscient enough to almost immediately find Isaac via security-camera footage of him foiling a bank robbery. So if they are that powerful, what good would Kyrah do by staying away? Shadow Force has the kind of screenplay that manages to explicate endlessly while explaining very little.Rather than proceeding quickly enough to render these questions irrelevant, the movie also has an odd habit of continually plopping the audience down into situations and subplots it seems to expect they will intuitively understand, like sequences featuring a couple of other Shadow Force agents played by Da’Vine Joy Randolph and Method Man. Many scenes start and stop without much sense, never gathering the kind of momentum that the movie’s shamelessly frequent child endangerment is supposed to provide. Instead, it primarily gives Washington, one of our more strenuous overactors, plenty of opportunity to revel in motherly anguish alongside her steely determination (which seems designed to compensate for the fact that action-wise, she doesn’t do a whole lot here). Sy fares a bit better in balancing a sense of warmth and toughness.The movie also lingers on moments featuring Strong’s hair-trigger Jack, perhaps because he’s the only character who seems to realize he is in a Joe Carnahan movie. That’s the real disappointment of this movie’s disposability. Carnahan doesn’t always hit, but he recently seemed to be mounting a comeback with the underseen 2021 thriller Copshop, which has some elements in common with this one: a charismatic Black woman in the lead, a scenery-chewing tough guy from the UK as her antagonist. It is also one of his best, least smirky, most exciting films, a western-style standoff picture with plenty of strong characterization and dark humor. Now comes this drab exercise in parental righteousness that has to make up a whole secret agency to serve as the object of mirthless wrath. Though it’s positioned in the early days of the summer movie reason, Shadow Force winds up as an unintentional advertisement for staying home.Shadow Force is out in US cinemas on 9 May and in the UK on 13 June",

            "content": "She considers herself a diehard South Island girl, but Harriet Baker, 33, won’t be raising her children in the city where she’s spent most of her life.“When we bought our house I said, ‘You’ll be taking me out of here in a casket,” she says, of the Dunedin home she and husband Cameron Baker, 33, sold last month.“But the living costs just keep climbing, you’re working hard and you can’t put any money away – it felt like we were treading water.”Their possessions are now winding their way to Western Australia, where the couple, their son Teddy, 2, and dog Hiccup, 8, relocated last week. Cameron will work as a heavy diesel mechanic in the mines while Harriet, formerly a public servant, will be the primary caregiver.Harriet would like to give Teddy a Kiwi upbringing around his New Zealand-based grandparents, but she knows that might not happen.“It does feel crazy that we’re leaving them. But that Australian income just flipped the switch for us.”The Baker family are among a surge of departures from New Zealand, mostly fleeing a weak economy, in an exodus that is fuelling concern for the country’s future and has small towns scrambling for survival. Demographers are particularly worried as all ages of New Zealanders – not just young people – are packing their bags.“I don’t know why we’re not talking about this more. We have a steep decline in fertility, a rapidly ageing population, and, out of Covid, we are seeing the rise and rise of departures,” says Massey University’s emeritus professor Paul Spoonley, a leading sociologist.“Parts of New Zealand are beginning to empty out, they will suffer stagnation or are in decline. The question for me is – will the number of New Zealanders leaving the country begin to come back?” Spoonley says.Over the past two years, tens of thousands of New Zealanders have left the country, surpassing the last spike in 2012. Record numbers of New Zealand migrants left the country through 2023 and into 2024. Figures remain high, with 69,100 leaving in the year to February 2025 – about 3% more than at this time last year.Overall, more new migrants are still arriving in New Zealand than departing. But last year saw the biggest net loss of New Zealanders than any calendar year on record. About 56% of New Zealand emigrants – those planning to live overseas for a year or more – head to Australia, where the average pay rate is 26% higher.For those aged 20-29, a backpacker-style overseas experience in Australia is a time-honoured rite of passage. They are still the biggest group leaving New Zealand but now, they are being followed by 30-39-year-olds and their children, as well as an unprecedented number of retirees – groups that are considered less likely to return.“We talk about where the “centre of gravity” for a family is, and if you’ve got parents, grandchildren or adult children living elsewhere, you’re relocating your centre of gravity,” Spoonley said.Experts are also worried about the impact on the workforce, now and in the future. This is in part due to working age people leaving New Zealand, and compounded by tighter immigration rules last year that are seeing fewer people coming on work visas.“This is a hollowing out of this demographic of mid-career workers, who in reality do the bulk of the work,” said Simplicity chief economist Shamubeel Eaqub. “That’s the jaws of death closing, and then we have labour market problems.”The high cost of living, along with wages, job conditions and difficulty finding employment were among the reasons given for moving by those spoken to by the Guardian. Many did not want to leave, but felt they were left with no option after struggling to get by.It’s a story repeated in small towns across New Zealand.In Ohakune, a North Island ski town, local Māori tribe (iwi) Ngāti Rangi are among those trying to figure out how to get people to stay. The area is in decline, with shuttered shops and ‘For Sale’ signs evidence of a population drop of almost a third since 1996 – a national trend demographers say shows no sign of slowing, as a majority of new migrants move to Auckland.“This is not a good news story for provincial and small town Aotearoa and it’s happening gradually, town by town and region by region,” says Tahu Kukutai, a demographer and co-director for Māori research centre Ngā Pae o Te Maramatanga.More recently in Ohakune, the closure of two mills by Winstone Pulp International in 2024 saw the loss of about 220 jobs. Jude Sinai, Ngāti Rangi’s redundancy support liaison, said about 10% of workers had moved overseas, others were struggling to find seasonal work or lower paying jobs.“We’ve had new recruits who bought homes at the higher end of the market, they didn’t see this coming, now they’re trying to service a mortgage shearing or mowing lawns. They think; ‘Do I go overseas and try to make it happen there?’”The iwi has launched business courses to try to upskill families, and is pushing for tourism businesses to employ more locals – anything to get them to stay.“Trying to get public services here is already so difficult, and when you take the numbers out of the area you get less attention. School rolls drop, there are teacher layoffs, lack of healthcare. We’re doing everything we can to lessen the magnitude of that scarring,” Sinai says.To boost the economy, the centre-right National party government has said it will cut new spending by $1bn to reduce borrowing and debt. Some economists say that could slow the recovery while Labour leader Chris Hipkins criticised spending reductions as an invitation to young New Zealanders to move overseas. Thousands of jobs have been cut from the public service since 2023.Finance minister, Nicola Willis, rejected those claims and told the Guardian the government would increase spending overall and save money by cutting unnecessary services. Willis said she “wanted see more New Zealanders choosing to stay here”. She said young people leaving New Zealand was an ongoing challenge, which could be addressed by growing the economy.“I am very concerned if New Zealanders don’t believe that they have good prospects in New Zealand. I want people to see that this is a place of enormous economic future and enormous social future.”But those overseas can’t see what would make them move home. Waikauri Hirini, 27, was a social worker in the small town of Te Kuiti in the central North Island before moving to Perth to join three generations of her family who already live over there, and work as a bank teller.“I started on $48,000 and I never got a pay rise, I had a high caseload, I was stressed,” she says.“When I graduated I couldn’t wait to help my community, where I grew up, but I just became burnt out and I thought ‘I don’t want this to be my life anymore’.“Now, we’re really settled. It would make me sad if I didn’t bring my children up back home, learning the Māori language and doing kapa haka, and that’s when we would think about going back. But what would we be going back to?”For many who have moved to Australia and elsewhere the fact remains; they are better off.“They’re willing to pay for good workers over here,” says surveyor Daniel Reed, 38, who moved to Townsville from a small North Island town with his wife and three young children last year.“We’re putting $1,000 away a fortnight and we enjoy our life, we’re not scraping by or wondering what the grocery bill is.” Leaving was hard, but their kids were already enjoying their new schools and lifestyles.“They’ll always be Kiwis, but they know the Australian national anthem. I don’t know if they remember the New Zealand one.”",

            "content": "Australian Catholics and politicians have embraced the appointment of the new pope, Leo XIV, with many hoping he will continue his predecessor’s emphasis on peace and social justice.Archbishop Timothy Costelloe, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, offered Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost – now known as Pope Leo XIV – heartfelt congratulations on behalf of the Roman Catholic church in Australia.“The Catholic Church in Australia assures Pope Leo XIV of our prayers, loyalty, and joyful anticipation of his spiritual leadership,” he said. “May his pontificate be marked by peace, unity, and a deepening of the Gospel message throughout the world.”Costelloe said the new pope had demonstrated his “approachability and willingness to listen” in his previous roles as the prefect of the dicastery for bishops and as an Augustinian missionary in Peru.Catholic Social Services Australia, which represents the church’s social services providers, said the pope’s choice of name had “profound significance” for Catholic social services. It evoked the legacy of Pope Leo XIII (1878–1903) who articulated the church’s commitment to human dignity and social justice in his encyclical Rerum Novrum.The organisation’s executive director, Dr Jerry Nockles, said the pope’s election came at a time when the world “yearns for compassionate leadership grounded in the Gospel values of justice, dignity and solidarity with the vulnerable”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email“At a time when Australia and indeed the world faces unprecedented social challenges – from growing inequality to escalating violence and social division – Pope Leo’s election offers a beacon of hope and a powerful reminder that the Church stands firmly for peace and with those on the margins,” he said.“His voice will undoubtedly challenge us all to build a more just and peaceful society where every person’s dignity is honoured, and peace is actively pursued.”Brother Mark O’Connor, head of communications for the Catholic archdiocese of Parramatta, told Radio National he had met the new pope, describing him as a “humble, gentle leader”.“He’s not different from Pope Francis in terms of vision, but maybe in style,” he said. “He’s more low key.”He said the Leo XIV had been to Australia and was not a fan of Vegemite but did like Tim Tams.O’Connor expected the new pope would be “very effective” in continuing to reform the church in the vision of Pope Francis.It was significant that the pope’s first words were about peace as well as his choice of name, he said.“You’ve got to remember that Pope Leo XIII was the first pope in the modern era who actually stood on the side of the workers and social justice,” he said, “which was really the beginnings of the church taking a much stronger stance on social justice.”Sign up to Breaking News AustraliaGet the most important news as it breaksafter newsletter promotionAnthony Albanese offered his heartfelt congratulations to Pope Leo XIV and invited him to Australia for the International Eucharistic Congress to be held in Sydney 2028.“This is a moment of joy and hope for Catholics all over the world,” the prime minister said. “May God bless Pope Leo XIV and may his papacy advance the cause of peace and justice, in the service of all humanity.”New South Wales premier Chris Minns welcomed the pope’s message of “peace, bridge building and compassion”, and offered him the state’s “best wishes as a leader in our turbulent world”.Father Frank Brennan, an Australian Jesuit priest, lawyer and academic, said the fastest conclave in a century suggested the new pope was “an absolute standout”.Brennan said the pope’s choice of name clearly indicated a strong commitment to social justice, although he anticipated Pope Leo XIV would be more “measured and precise” than Pope Francis on questions of doctrine.Archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, said the pope’s greeting of peace, which emphasised that God’s love was “without any limits or conditions”, as “very moving”.The Australian Catholic University said it was a time of renewed hope and guidance.Its chancellor, Martin Daubney, said: “We share his commitment to strengthening dialogue and the defence of human rights in a world in need of hope and unity.",

            "content": "Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former chief executive of the cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network, was sentenced on Thursday to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty in December to securities fraud and commodities fraud.Mashinsky’s sentence was imposed by US District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan, and is among the longest in a criminal case arising from the 2022 meltdown in cryptocurrency markets.Sam Bankman-Fried, who led the FTX exchange, is serving a 25-year prison sentence after being convicted of fraud. He is appealing.Federal prosecutors said Mashinsky, 59, misled customers about Celsius’s safety, and artificially inflated the value of Celsius’s proprietary token Cel.They sought a prison term of at least 20 years, calling it “just punishment” for Mashinsky’s having victimized thousands of people and caused billions of dollars in losses, while drawing more than $48m of personal benefits.“The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive,” the the US attorney in Manhattan Jay Clayton said in a statement.Mashinsky sought one year and one day in prison, saying he felt remorse and wanted to do right by his family and former Celsius customers. His sentence includes three years of supervised release and a $48.4m forfeiture.Lawyers for Mashinsky were not immediately available for comment.Founded in 2017, Celsius, based in Hoboken, New Jersey, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022 after customers rushed to withdraw deposits as cryptocurrency prices fell.Born in Ukraine, Mashinsky emigrated with his family to Israel, and moved to New York after visiting the city in 1988.Cryptocurrency lenders have promised easy loan access and high interest rates to depositors while lending tokens to institutional investors, hoping to profit from the difference.Celsius offered 17% interest on some deposits, but had a $1.19bn balance sheet deficit when it sought bankruptcy protection.Mashinsky has also faced civil lawsuits by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general Letitia James.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 00:06",
            "content": "The UK and US have agreed a “breakthrough” trade deal slashing some of Donald Trump’s tariffs on cars, aluminium and steel and that the prime minister said would save thousands of British jobs.Keir Starmer said it was a “fantastic, historic day” as he announced the agreement, the first by the White House since Trump announced sweeping global tariffs last month.Starmer, speaking to workers at the Jaguar Land Rover plant in Solihull, said the agreement had saved jobs in the car and steel industries that had been under threat.Paul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the deal “takes us back from the brink and many workers will breathe easier as a result”.However critics said it had failed to address many of the high tariffs that remain in place between the two countries.John Denton, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said: “The reality is that US tariffs on UK exports remain significantly higher than they were at the start of the year.” He said it was still unclear what would happen to industries not explicitly covered by the deal, such as pharmaceuticals.The US agreed to cut the 25% tariff rate on British steel and aluminium exports to zero. The concession will be seen as a lifeline to the steel industry, for which the US is an important export market and which has been on the verge of collapse.American tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars will also be reduced to 10%, down from the 27.5% rate Trump initially announced. The US is the main export market for British cars, worth more than £9bn last year.Washington promised to give “preferential treatment” to the UK’s pharmaceutical industry, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs, although none have been set yet, and American aerospace manufacturers will receive preferential access to high-quality UK aerospace components. A 10% baseline tariff on most goods remains in place.There was relief, too, that British beef farmers will be allowed access to the US market, joining a small group of countries including Australia, while US farmers will be granted new access to the UK.Starmer said there would be no watering down of food standards with this measure, with imports of hormone-treated beef or chlorinated chicken remaining illegal.“I know people along the way were urging me to walk away, to descend in a different kind of relationship. We didn’t,” the prime minister said. “We did the hard yards. We stayed in the room. I’m really pleased to say to the workforce here and through them to the country, how important I think this deal is.”But he added it was “jobs won, not jobs done” and the UK would keep negotiating in areas including tech, where ministers want to improve cooperation with the US, and the film industry, which Trump has also threatened with tariffs.Peter Mandelson, the UK’s ambassador to the US, said a “technology partnership” would be negotiated “over the coming months”. JD Vance, the US vice-president, is expected to play a key role.The announcement was made in a choreographed phone call between Starmer and Trump, while the press gathered with the leaders on either end of the line.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, criticised the deal, claiming that the UK has been “shafted” by Trump. “When Labour negotiates, Britain loses. We cut our tariffs – America tripled theirs. Keir Starmer called this ‘historic.’ It’s not historic, we’ve just been shafted!” However Andrew Griffith, the shadow trade secretary, said the reduction in tariffs would “be welcomed by exporting businesses”.A trade group representing Detroit automakers also criticised the deal, claiming it unfairly penalises US automakers that have partnered with Canada and Mexico. In a sharply worded statement, the American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) said its members – including Ford, General Motors and Jeep-maker Stellantis – faced import tariffs of 25% on cars assembled in Canada and Mexico.“We are disappointed that the administration prioritised the UK ahead of our North American partners,” Blunt said. “Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little US content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts.”The final stages of negotiations were mired in chaos after UK officials scrambled to announce the deal when it became clear that Trump was ready to finalise it on Wednesday night. Industry figures were informed of it only in the early hours of Thursday.Starmer said he had “not at all” been bounced into the deal but “didn’t know the exact day” it would be completed. “I wouldn’t be having my phone call with President Trump halfway through the second half of the Arsenal v PSG game had I planned it better. That’s the way it turned out and that’s the discussion we were having late last night about how we proceeded with this deal,” he said.UK government officials said the deal was a starting point from which the two sides would keep negotiating. Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, told reporters that the UK would continue trying to reduce the 10% baseline tariff. He said the agreement did not include any concessions on the digital services tax, online safety laws, or the NHS.Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told reporters later that negotiations about digital services tax were continuing. “The digital tax has spread like a bad virus around the world … and it basically targets American companies,” he said.The UK is the first country to strike an agreement with Trump since his announcement of global tariffs on what he called “liberation day”. That sent global stock markets plunging for days until Trump brought in a 90-day pause, which will expire in July.The US has been under pressure to strike tariff agreements to shore up its economy. For months, as economists warned Trump’s trade strategy risked triggering a recession, the president and his closest officials insisted it would set the stage for the White House to hammer out dozens of trade deals.US officials are in talks with other leading economies, including India and Japan, but agreements have yet to materialise. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, said this week that talks were under way with 17 countries.In Westminster, the Liberal Democrats called for a vote on the agreement, saying it would show “complete disrespect to the public” if MPs were denied a say, especially with talks continuing and the potential for more details to emerge around contentious issues such as food safety.The US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, told reporters she hoped to expand the agreement to include all meats and that she would be visiting the UK next week to make this point, adding: “There is no industry that has been treated more unfairly than our agriculture industry.”Navarro later told reporters outside the White House that British consumers would like chicken and beef imported from the US despite the use of chlorine and hormones.He called sanitary standards a “phoney tool used to suppress what is very fine American agricultural product” and said the market should decide, adding: “We don’t believe that once [British people] taste American beef and chicken that they would prefer not to have it.”Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers’ Union, said he welcomed reciprocal access to the US beef market, but was concerned imported American beef would be produced to a lower standard.",

            "content": "Stephen Sondheim’s final musical is a passion project in more ways than one. An adaptation of two films by Luis Buñuel, it reflects his lifelong love of cinema. Sondheim began mulling over the idea more than four decades ago (with playwright-director James Lapine) and started working on it almost a decade before he died in 2021.This production’s programme notes speak of its development as a slow process with email exchanges between Sondheim, director Joe Mantello and book writer David Ives. A parting gift from Sondheim, left in draft form, it makes its European premiere after a run in New York in 2023 – two actors from that production are joined by an otherwise new cast. It is full of adventurous imagination, with some signature Sondheim sparks, but the trouble spots are still clear to see.Its plot is a blended rearrangement of the 1972 social satire The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, in which a group of idle rich types make plans for dinner which are repeatedly foiled, and The Exterminating Angel (1962), about the aftermath of a party in a house where the servants have fled and the diners are mysteriously trapped. The first act is based on the former film, the second largely on the latter.Mantello’s production begins energetically with wryly satirical humour about the charmed lives of the 1%. There are funny exchanges in the first restaurant they visit, Cafe Everything, which falls woefully short of its name. Subsequent restaurant scenes are a pale reflection, bordering on farce, and where The Discreet Charm is filled with surreal hauntings and dreams within dreams, this does not translate with the same air of intrigue on stage.The actors are vibrant nonetheless, though some are wobbly singers. Paulo Szot, as ambassador of the imaginary South American nation Miranda, has an impressive operatic depth to his voice and Chumisa Dornford-May, who plays the revolutionary Fritz ­– a trustafarian who is given an unconvincing romance with a soldier – is a strong singer, too, while Rory Kinnear is fun as the arrogant Leo Brink.But as the show travels from movement to stasis, with emphatic repetition that is as existential as it is literal, it falters in momentum and brings longueurs, despite urgent warnings about the end of the world. Musically, the sound is unmistakably Sondheim’s but there is no one great song, not even one memorable song. There is heartiness and humour but little of Sondheim’s usually intimate or penetrating psychology. Lyrics contain some good satire but also banal rhymes such as “Ladies and gents before we dine / Let us thank the lord for cheese and wine”. Recitative with deliberate dissonance seems strained at times.The unravelling after the dinner of the second act gains significance in its metaphor and becomes a dystopia in a drawing room: these spoiled rich people’s inertia leads to their own imprisonment once the servants have left. But the class satire is not potent enough. The couples speak in disparaging ways about the servants who, in the film, seem quietly fulminating (one even speaks of her hate of Jesus) but who do not have the same alienation and contained rage here. They are comical stock figures without sharp edges until we get to the ambassador’s home when his butler bluntly spells out his frustrations.If the script and music lack fizz, there are at least the visual thrills and spills of David Zinn’s set, with a blinding luminosity giving the effect of a hallucination, and the realist setting of the last act in the ambassador’s opulent home abounding with surreal edges.Is this whole scenario a dream in the vein of Jean-Paul Sartre’s Huis Clos, a play in which hell really is other people when they become stuck in the same room for eternity? Here We Are should leave you scratching your head but for all its interesting ideas on life and death, rich and poor, it melts away rather too quickly afterwards. At the Lyttelton, National Theatre, London, until 28 June",

            "published_at": "2025-05-9 00:01",
            "content": "Hospitals in England are cutting staff, closing services and planning to ration care in order to make “eye-watering” savings demanded by NHS bosses.Rehabilitation centres face being shut, talking therapies services cut and beds for end-of-life care reduced as part of efforts by England’s 215 NHS trusts to comply with a “financial reset”.Sir Jim Mackey, NHS England’s new chief executive, has ordered them to make unprecedented savings during 2025-26 to avoid a projected £6.6bn deficit becoming a reality.But trust bosses are warning that delivering what for some equates to 12% of their entire budget in “efficiency savings” will affect patients and waiting times.“These [savings targets] are at eye-wateringly high levels”, said Saffron Cordery, the interim chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts. “It’s going to be extremely challenging.”Trusts have to make, in some cases, deep cuts in order to stay in the black this year, despite the government having given the NHS an extra £22bn for last year and this one.A survey it conducted among trust leaders found that diabetes services for young people and hospital at-home-style “virtual wards” were among the areas of care likely to be scaled back.Trusts are planning to shrink their workforce by up to 1,500 posts each to save money, even though they fear that could damage the quality or safety of care provided.Cordery said the looming cuts were so significant that the prime minister, Keir Starmer, and health secretary, Wes Streeting, may not be able to fulfil promises to revive the NHS, such as pledges to improve waiting times for diagnostic tests, surgery and A&E care.“We’ve got the narrative of the ‘three shifts’ … and those are driving the decisions that the government is making, alongside the imminent delivery of the [NHS] 10-year plan and pressures on transforming the NHS for the future,” she said.“But we’ve got to question whether those are compatible with the needs of delivering the financial recovery and for trusts to really meet the operational challenges they face.”Ministers would have to explain to the public that trusts were having to make potentially unpopular decisions about staff numbers and what services they provided as a result of Mackey’s financial “reset”, and defend their decisions, Cordery added.“Politicians are going to have to give trusts air cover locally and nationally when they need to make some changes, because even if trusts aren’t cuttings services or closing services, they may well be moving services.”The survey of 160 senior figures from 114 trusts found that:47% were cutting services and another 43% were considering doing so.37% were cutting clinical posts and a further 40% may follow suit.26% were closing some services and 55% more may do so.“These findings show that trust leaders are having to think the previously unthinkable in terms of cutting posts. These include clinical roles,” said Cordery.“We are already seeing cutbacks in temporary and ‘bank’ staff, including doctors, nurses, healthcare support workers and allied health professionals that could include physios and other types of therapists.”In a recent update to staff, the boss of the Barking, Havering and Redbridge trust in east London, Matthew Trainer, warned that making £61m of savings this year – double last year’s £30m total – would be “painful”, especially given the rising demand for care and need to improve waiting times.The trust is cutting 115 posts in corporate services to save £7.5m and slashing the number of shifts it gives “bank” and agency staff by more than a third as part of an attempt to cut its wage bill by £40m.Having fewer staff on duty could have “adverse effects on patients”, Trainer acknowledged. “We will mitigate any risks to patients as best we can and ensure we continue to have properly skilled clinical staff delivering good quality care to the patients that need it”, he said.A second trust chief executive, who has to save £16m this year, said: “At the moment I don’t know how I’m going to do it.”A third echoed Trainer’s concern that staff cuts could endanger patients. “Last year the [NHS’s] combined deficit was £200m. I recognise that this is unaffordable and cannot continue. But it’s really difficult to find a way to protect safe care to patients … and to [also] deliver the financial efficiencies.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We invested an extra £26bn to fix the broken health and care system we inherited, and through our plan for change, are determined to tackle inefficiencies and drive up productivity in the NHS.“We have underlined the need for trusts to cut bureaucracy to invest even further in the frontline, so we can support hard-working staff and deliver a better service for patients and taxpayers’ money.”",

            "content": "I recognise myself to be very contrarian, to the point of reacting in this fashion in every situation, regardless of what it is. How can I change this?Eleanor says: It sounds as though there’s a gap between what you want to do and what you do. You can see you’re being contrarian, you want to change that, but that’s not enough to mean things actually change.Generally in that situation – whatever it is – you have a couple of routes available.One is to focus on how changing might make things nicer for the people you care about. Just kicking yourself into motivation doesn’t always work. Focusing on other people can succeed where trying to improve ourselves has failed. Can you think of particular people affected by this habit; ways their lives would be better without it? What’s it like for them to be near this?At its extremes, contrarianism can make people feel stupid for nearly everything they say. It can jack up the costs of venturing an opinion or making a suggestion so much that the people around you just stop trying. If every way of engaging with you leads to conflict or defensiveness, people can feel defeated from the jump – pre-emptively scrutinised and criticised to the extent it’s not worth having views or tastes of their own. This is a good way to give the people around you a complex. It can communicate that you think it’s unlikely they’d say something true or propose something insightful.I know contrarianism can be an enjoyable mental exercise. It’s tremendous fun to find relationships where you can take ideas for a walk and it’s a relief to have relationships where divergent views or preferences don’t automatically count as conflict. But there’s a huge difference between sincere disagreement and just negating for negation’s sake. When you negate people all the time, they will (rightly) suspect that you’re not motivated by any kind of sincere view about the topic at hand– but by an interpersonal need to push back against people. Lots of people will feel defeated and squashed by this or unable to express how annoying it is when you then take refuge in “just asking questions”.So maybe thinking about others, not yourself, might help – including in the ways they don’t tell you about because they don’t want to be contradicted in that conversation, too.Last, like all habits we want to change or virtues we want to cultivate, it might help to start very concrete and very small. Could you make it a goal to have just one conversation a week where you learn something from someone that you don’t already know? That might help you feel what it’s like to inhabit a different, non-contrarian posture.Normally when we’re learning from people we ask questions, we see them as potentially credible and interesting, as capable of helping us. These are nicer ways to be seen than as a vector of possible falsehood. Rather than scanning for ways to disagree, perhaps shifting your focus to what other people can teach you is a good place to start.",

            "content": "Antonee Robinson has been one of the best full-backs in the league this season. He flies up and down the left flank, defends well and whips in crosses. However, the Fulham defender was not at his sharpest during his side’s defeat by Aston Villa last weekend. He found it difficult to contain Morgan Rogers and his crossing was not up to its usual high standards. The concern is whether Robinson, who had missed Fulham’s previous game, is in peak physical condition. It has been a long campaign but Marco Silva needs the USA international to be ready to go when Everton visit Craven Cottage on Saturday. Robinson’s raids are a key part of Fulham’s attacking setup. Jacob SteinbergFulham v Everton, Saturday 3pm (all times BST)In late November, the Premier League website ran a story asking why some teams were so much better at home. Brentford were the focus; Thomas Frank’s side were top of the home form table with 16 points out of 18 but only Southampton had picked up fewer points on the road. Brentford added two more home wins before defeat to Nottingham Forest sparked a run of eight without victory in front of their home fans. They even lost an FA Cup tie to Plymouth there. But fast-forward to now and, remarkably, Brentford have the best away form in the top flight. They’ve picked up 19 points in their past eight away games – three more than anyone else over the same period – and will be heavily fancied to add to that record at relegated Ipswich. If Frank can somehow join the two positive streaks together, could Brentford be top-six contenders next season? David TindallIpswich v Brentford, Saturday 3pmAs a sense of familiarity returns to Manchester City’s results – it’s now seven wins and a draw in their past eight games – the mid-season madness seems hard to comprehend. Pep Guardiola’s side lost nine times in 12 matches, including a streak of five in a row, between October and December. They suffered another run of five defeats in nine outings across February and March. And yet a win over rock-bottom Southampton this weekend along with an Arsenal defeat at Liverpool and City will be level with Mikel Arteta’s side on 67 points. City close with games against Bournemouth (h) and Fulham (a) while Arsenal host Newcastle and travel to Southampton. It’s now a distinct possibility that the history books will show City as the 2024-25 runners-up, the end-of-a-dynasty narrative looking absurdly premature. DTSouthampton v Manchester City, Saturday 3pmWith Wolves striking up an impressive rhythm under Vítor Pereira, survival comfortably boxed off, now the challenge is to use a strong end to this season as a platform for the next one. Emmanuel Agbadou and Marshall Munetsi were signed in January to increase the team’s physicality but, while Pereira has been an overwhelming success, his appointment has not worked for everyone. Neither Tommy Doyle nor Hwang Hee-chan has started a league game since January while Pablo Sarabia has been almost exclusively used as a substitute. Sam Johnstone, a £10m signing last summer, last started a league game in December and has been relegated to the role of third-choice goalkeeper. Matheus Cunha has a £62.5m release clause and the captain, Nélson Semedo, is out of contract next month. Rayan Aït-Nouri has admirers but Wolves are hopeful of rewarding him with a new deal, while the Brazil midfielders André and João Gomes are tied to long-term contracts. Beyond the talismanic Cunha, expect another off-season of change at Molineux. Ben FisherWolves v Brighton, Saturday 3pmTwo of the season’s most watchable sides collide on the south coast with European places still up for grabs, albeit Bournemouth’s hopes are dependent on permutations elsewhere. Both they and Villa will be relieved to have rediscovered winning habits last weekend in victories that demonstrated each side’s resilience as much as their flair. The spotlight on Andoni Iraola’s attacking philosophy and talents such as Evanilson and Antoine Semenyo has overshadowed Bournemouth’s defensive improvements this term, with Dean Huijsen one of their most important acquisitions last summer. That defensive mettle will get a full test against Ollie Watkins, Morgan Rogers and co, but Villa have looked a bit weary in recent weeks and need to step up in what is probably Saturday’s most enticing top-flight fixture. Tom DaviesBournemouth v Aston Villa, Saturday 5.30pmWhen Newcastle lost 2-1 at Stamford Bridge last October, Eddie Howe’s team seemed poised for mid-table irrelevance. It was their fifth league game without victory and Alexander Isak’s goal was their first from open play for more than seven hours. The following month Howe switched Sandro Tonali from the No 8 role to the No 6 position, moving Bruno Guimarães in the opposite direction, and everything changed. With Tonali dictating the tempo, Newcastle morphed into a formidable force, not merely winning the Carabao Cup – beating Enzo Maresca’s Chelsea along the way – but placing themselves within touching distance of a second Champions League qualification in three years. After Newcastle’s run of 20 wins in their past 27 matches Howe has confounded those who questioned his position last autumn. And to think he only secured the job after first Rafael Benítez and then Unai Emery rejected it. Maresca has infinitely more to lose from this high-noon, high-stakes duel, with its subplot of an attacking beauty contest involving Isak and Cole Palmer. Louise TaylorNewcastle v Chelsea, Sunday noonYou’ve got to credit Manchester United and West Ham – not words often written but bear with me – for their remarkable dedication to exploring just how badly a rich club can perform without fearing relegation. In 35 league games, these lavishly appointed squads have each lost 16 times, scoring 42 and 40 goals respectively; the last time United beat a side other than the relegated three was on 26 January, while West Ham have not done so since 22 February. Which is to say that both teams remain, despite changing managers mid-season, in absolutely despicable form, and as such this encounter threatens to rival United’s November game against Chelsea for ineptitude per pound spent. There might, though, be a redeeming feature: with the Europa League final imminent, Ruben Amorim will presumably play some younger players, perhaps granting a debut to Bendito Mantato, a promising right-wingback who signed his first professional contract this week. He, and they, could scarcely do any worse. Daniel HarrisManchester United v West Ham, Sunday 2.15pmNottingham Forest won’t have a better chance of getting their spluttering Champions League push back on track than against their East Midlands rivals. One possible snag is that Nuno Espiríto Santo’s side, at home to relegated and demoralised opposition, are likely to have plenty of the ball, which tends not to suit perhaps the best counterattacking side in the country. The match in which Forest have had the most possession this season – against Brentford at the City Ground last week – led to one of their most deflating performances and results, a 0-2 loss. The injured Callum Hudson-Odoi has also been missed. Leicester don’t have Brentford’s nous and should be seen off. However, buoyed up by a rare win in last weekend’s el crapico against Southampton and with the evergreen Jamie Vardy hunting a 200th goal for the club, Leicester will not be without motivation. TDNottingham Forest v Leicester, Sunday 2.15pmTottenham are in the middle of a league season dreadful beyond all prediction and conception. Ange Postecoglou is in serious danger of losing his job even if his team win the Europa League, but capturing that trophy feels like the only way he can possibly save himself, so everything he does between now and then will be with that in mind. Spurs have suffered badly with injuries this season – Postecoglou might have mentioned it once or twice – and the balance he must find is between preserving those upon whom he intends to rely in Bilbao, and having them arrive in Spain nicely grooved. A game against Palace, themselves preparing for a final, might just be the best way of satisfying both aspects. DHTottenham v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2.15pmTrent Alexander-Arnold announced he was leaving Liverpool with three matches of the season remaining to avoid accusations of sneaking through the back door when his long-anticipated move to Real Madrid is finally confirmed. A courageous step, although one that makes the final weeks of the boyhood fan’s Liverpool career more awkward than they would have been otherwise. Anfield will give its first response to the news against Arsenal, who require a reaction of their own to Champions League misery in Paris with second place in the Premier League far from secure. While there may be anger in the stands at losing Alexander-Arnold on a free transfer, Arne Slot’s treatment of the full-back will be more cold-eyed. Slot has known of Alexander-Arnold’s intentions since late March but has started the defender in Liverpool’s last two games. Now his exit is confirmed, however, it is time to think only of the future and start Conor Bradley, providing the Northern Ireland international is fit.

            "content": "A delighted Ruben Amorim praised “perfect” two-goal Mason Mount, as Manchester United swept past Athletic Bilbao and into the Europa League final against Tottenham, with four late strikes in 19 minutes.Ruben Amorim’s men trailed 1-0 to Athletic Bilbao following Mikel Jauregizar’s first-half opener at Old Trafford and led 3-1 on aggregate before Mount equalised on 72 minutes of the second leg. Goals from Casemiro and Rasmus Højlund, in the 79th and 85th minutes followed before Mount scored again in added-time’s first minute.The 26-year-old’s opener came via an impressive pivot-and-curled finish, the second a precise 45-yard shot into Athletic’s empty net. The goals were Mount’s finest contribution for United following a series of injuries that have blighted him since he signed in summer 2023.Amorim said: “I’m so happy for him. He is such a player. He works really hard, he has quality. When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.“Not just me – if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach, you look at the other guys on the bench and they are so happy for Mason Mount – everyone in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything to be available. He is a really good player and both goals were really good.”Mount entered on 62 minutes with Amad Diallo and Luke Shaw, as part of a triple change from Amorim that the head coach acknowledged “changed the game”.“That is credit to the players,” he added. “I felt we needed a bit more energy. We needed to keep the ball.”United are down in 15th and guaranteed to finish in their lowest Premier League place. Amorim was asked what claiming the Europa League in the final at the San Mamés Stadium on Wednesday week would represent.He said: “Every coach will say the next one is the most important. Your first is the most important [at a club] because you want to establish yourself as a coach, but it would be massive especially after this season in the Premier League.“I think that is clear [confidence would be boosted] – the money is not the most important and even to win a title as a coach is that feeling we can do good things, to give something to our fans. So I agree it is not just playing in the Champions League next season, it is that feeling we can change things.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionUnited have lost twice to Spurs in the league and once in the Carabao Cup this season.“Every game has its history, we lost the three last games so we can win this one,” said Amorim. “You look at the odds, we are closer to win than lose. Both teams are going to play all or nothing.“The position of the coach is similar, I know Ange [Postecoglou] has one more year but we are struggling both of us [in our jobs]. That is the good thing. The bad thing with this team? I never know. We have to understand that a final is completely different from the Premier League.”",

            "content": "The home favourite Luke Humphries continued the feelgood factor in Leeds by winning night 14 of the Premier League, beating Luke Littler in the final. Littler, a Manchester United fan, had earlier mocked Leeds fans in his opening matchThe city has been celebrating the football club’s promotion from the Championship this week and the buoyant supporters got to watch their adopted favourite book his place in the playoffs later this month.Their celebrations at the First Direct Arena were made even sweeter because of Littler’s 6-5 defeat in the final, with the teenager roundly booed throughout.Humphries, who is from Berkshire but supports Leeds, made it back-to-back wins in Yorkshire after his success in 2024 and ensured he will join Littler at London’s O2 Arena for the decisive night of action in three weeks.Littler had earlier goaded the hostile fans, mocking them with pretend crying during his quarter-final win over Nathan Aspinall before beating Gerwyn Price in the semi-final. However, Humphries got the better of him in a gripping final, clinching a final-leg decider after Littler missed a shot at bullseye to win the match. The 27-year-old hit five 180s and averaged 100.96 to end his 10-week wait for a nightly win.“I really wanted to win. I’m really, really pleased to win in Leeds. It’s been a great couple of weeks for Leeds,” he said. “It is extra special to win in Leeds. I feel at home here, I know it isn’t my home town but it does feel extra special.“I won here last year and it gave me extra confidence for the finals night and hopefully it does again and I can get that elusive Premier League crown that I’ve always dreamt of.“When you know you’re playing against Luke Littler you know you’re not going to get away with mid-game performances, you need to be at your best to beat him.”Humphries kicked off the evening with a 6-4 win over Michael van Gerwen, who is still waiting for a first nightly victory of this year’s tournament. The seven-time champion’s presence at the playoffs is far from secure, with Aspinall and Rob Cross still breathing down his neck.Stephen Bunting helped his own chances with a run to the semi-final, where he was beaten by Humphries. Bunting beat Chris Dobey in their quarter-final while Price’s win over Cross guaranteed his place in the playoffs.",

            "content": "Ange Postecoglou said it would be “massive” for Tottenham to win the Europa League after they set up an all-English final thanks to a resilient 2-0 win over Bodø/Glimt.Spurs, who have gone 17 years without silverware, made it through to their first European final since 2019 after producing a streetwise display on a plastic pitch in northern Norway. Goals from Pedro Porro and Dominic Solanke sealed a 5-1 aggregate win, meaning the north London club will qualify for the Champions League if they beat Manchester United in ­Bilbao on 21 May.It would be a stunning way for Spurs to end a troubled campaign. They have struggled in the ­Premier League but Postecoglou, who remains in danger of losing his job, did not downplay how significant it would be for his side to end the wait for a major trophy.“It’s massive,” the Spurs manager said. “Of course it is, because you have to frame it against what this club has been through over the last 15 or 20 years and what the supporters have been through. A final is a unique standalone game, it’s a bit different to everything you do in the buildup to it. But if you’re talking about resilience and adversity, this group of players have had it in bucket-loads this year and we’ve still found a way to deal with it.“We’ve been losing players, key players, and yet they’ve still found a way to stick together and believe in what we’re doing. That gives me the belief that the challenge we have of trying to overcome a tough opponent in a massive game – I know the lads have it in them to rise to that.”Postecoglou has previously spoken about watching European finals with his father when he was a child in Australia. “I’ve got friends who I grew up with who are probably booking tickets to Bilbao,” he said. “For all intents and purposes I’ll be on the touchline but almost with the imposter syndrome that I should be in the stands with them because that’s where it comes from. It’s my fourth year in European football and I’ve got the chance to lead a team into a European final.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotion“That’s something I will look back on but I’d rather look back fondly with a positive memory on the day. But yeah, [it’s] not just my dad but my family, my wife who was here today cheering on with the away end.“Credit to her and two boys on a school night who I’ve promised a trip to Bilbao. There’s so many people you know who take the knocks and feel it more than I do. I’m sure they’re proud of me tonight but more importantly I’m just pleased I can give it back to them for all their sacrifices.”Postecoglou, who can still make good on his promise about always winning a trophy in his second season, has adopted a more pragmatic approach in Europe.“I love winning,” he said. “That’s what I’ve done my whole career. People will dismiss it, that’s fine. But I love winning, and I love the way the boys understood what we needed to do tonight. It’s a credit to the boys that they understood the task and still had the quality to score the goals.”",

            "content": "JD Vance has said that the US will not intervene in the conflict between Pakistan and India, calling fighting between the two nuclear powers “fundamentally none of our business”.The remarks came during an interview with Fox News, where the US vice-president said that the US would seek to de-escalate the conflict but could force neither side to “lay down their arms”.“What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it,” Vance said during the interview. As the US could force neither side to lay down their arms, he continued, the country would “continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels”.“Our hope and our expectation is that this is not going to spiral into a broader regional war or, God forbid, a nuclear conflict,” Vance said. “Right now, we don’t think that’s going to happen.”The remarks match Donald Trump’s “America first” foreign policy of calling for a retreat from the US role as a mediator in foreign conflicts. Trump and Vance have both warned that the United States is willing to walk away from an attempt to broker a ceasefire in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine if the two sides cannot be led to hold direct talks.India on Thursday evening said that it had thwarted missile and drone strikes launched by Pakistan in what would mark the latest round of tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries. Indian missile strikes on Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday killed 31 people. India claimed that it was targeting “terrorist infrastructure”, while Pakistan denied that any terrorist groups had been operating in the areas hit by Indian missiles.As Vance signaled the US continued intent to take a diminished role in mediating conflicts abroad, secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke with leaders of both countries and called for an “immediate de-escalation” in the fighting. The Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers also flew into Delhi on Thursday.Vance, who has played a significant role in foreign policy in the new Trump administration, traveled to India last month, where he said that India could retaliate against “terrorists” in Pakistan but said the US did not want that to spiral into a broader regional conflict.“Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said, referring to a recent Islamist militant attack in Kashmir. “And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with.”",

            "content": "This match meant everything to Manchester United’s season, the one that could save it from oblivion. Amid the Sir Jim Ratcliffe penny-pinching, there was budget for pyrotechnics to complement the tifos and raucous chanting from both sets of fans to create a glorious backdrop for what could be one of the final great European nights at Old Trafford.With plans in place to knock down the Theatre of Dreams and replace it with a 100,000-capacity stadium in as soon as five years and the current United squad going through a transition under Ruben Amorim, the prospect of reaching the final four in major competitions before the final brick is laid is not guaranteed.They used to be the norm. From George Best seeing off Real Madrid in the first leg of the European Cup semi-final in 1968 to Paul Scholes rifling the ball into the top corner against Barcelona 40 years later, the stadium has created a plethora of continental memories.Those days are far behind and, even with thousands of supporters having already booked flights for the final in Bilbao, United did not look like taking the easy return route to northern Spain and a battle with Tottenham for a Champions League place until a late flurry of goals.On arrival, it felt as though even the Premier League’s 15th-best team could not mess up a three-goal lead from a week ago. The almost 4,000 Athletic Bilbao fans in one corner, who had spent the day learning about Samuel Smith’s beer in the city centre, were eager to know there was still a tie on the line. The bufandas (scarves) were swung around heads and ikurrinas (the Basque flags) were put on display across the hoardings by those in txapelas (the traditional berets). When the retiring club legend Óscar de Marcos was sent to warm up, he demanded an increase in intensity from the fans and his fist pumping was met with robust roars.The noise levels were matched by the intensity on the pitch from the two sides. United were looking to close down Athletic in the early stages but they became sloppy and the Basques made the most of the space they were given.If the majority were expecting a walkover, they did not plan for the Basques’ anglicised spirit from a club who can boast a La Liga-winning manager from Hazel Grove, William Garbutt in 1935-36. Athletic were willing to use every potential opportunity as United creaked under the weight of expectation. Errors were committed in the buildup to the opener, although Mikel Jauregizar’s curling shot from 25 yards into the top corner created a small eruption.This is not the United of Sir Alex Ferguson, Roy Keane and Scholes, they are still finding an identity under Amorim. When things are against them, strength of character is not always at the forefront of their thinking. But if atmospheres in the league have lacked enthusiasm and decibels, this was not the case. The supporters recognised the need to back their players, as was happening in the away end.Tension grew as Athletic were on top, requiring United to find fortitude. If the hosts were hoping for a reset at half-time, it did not look forthcoming. Loose passes were putting them in trouble and only the failings of Athletic, hampered by the absence of creative trio Iñaki and Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet, meant André Onana was left untroubled.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionUnited have beaten only the now relegated Southampton and Ipswich at Old Trafford in the league since 1 December. Playing at home is not the joy it was in the days when most opponents were defeated in the tunnel beforehand.Álex Berenguer was able to wander into space unchallenged as United lost their discipline and nerves abounded inside Old Trafford. Amid the cacophony, United needed leaders to calm things down but tranquility was hard to find in a team packed with experience as Manuel Ugarte forgot how to play a simple pass and Casemiro was booked for a late challenge, leaving Amorim to put Bruno Fernandes into a deeper role to steady the ship.Amorim’s trio of changes added the experience of Luke Shaw and Mason Mount plus the dribbling skills of Amad Diallo to turn the tide in United’s favour, as Athletic faded physically. For all of Mount’s struggles in Manchester, few doubt the quality he possesses and he has a fine European CV. When others were failing to keep their heads, Mount remained calm to swivel and level the score with an expert finish, followed up by Casemiro’s ingenuity, Rasmus Højlund’s tap-in and Mount’s encore to rock Old Trafford.A vintage European night on the pitch it was not, despite the scoreline, but everyone inside Old Trafford made it into one. It might not have been the parade United had envisaged when the clouds of red smoke were rising into the sky before kick-off but it offers a potential route back to more great Champions League nights before the curtain closes at the theatre.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 22:54",
            "content": "Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, has compared his nation to the European countries heading for conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, in a punchy speech commemorating the end of the second world war in Europe.“Eighty years after the end of the European war, the message of history is clear. Today, 80 years later, we share the same values ​​and face similar challenges as many of the democracies that participated in the European war,” Lai said to a group of foreign dignitaries gathered in Taipei.Lai’s speech comes at a time when Taiwan is facing increasing military pressure from China. It is the first time Taiwan has officially commemorated the end of the second world war in Europe.The conflict is a thorny topic in cross-strait relations. China at the time was ruled by the Kuomintang, or the nationalists, under the banner of the Republic of China.During the war, the Kuomintang fought alongside the Chinese Communist party (CCP) against the Japanese, before resuming their own civil conflict, which led to the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in 1949 and establishing the Republic of China there. This remains the island’s official name. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China in Beijing.In a veiled reference to China, Lai called on “freedom-loving people and countries” to work together to counter authoritarian regimes.“Taiwan and Europe are jointly facing the threat of a new totalitarian group,” Lai said. “The bitter experience of world war two tells us that appeasement will only make the invaders more greedy and expand their ambitions.”Thursday’s event opened with a short video featuring clips of the D-day landings in Normandy and audio recordings of Winston Churchill’s famous “We shall fight on the beaches” speech.The top British representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, spoke at the event, as did Lutz Güllner, the head of the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan.Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security Policy, said Lai was “trying to send the message that security and prosperity of Taiwan and Europe are still interconnected, so that European partners fearing possible withdrawal of American security guarantees from Europe don’t turn away from their engagements with the Indo-Pacific and security in the Taiwan Strait”.Lai is steering Taiwan through a fraught geopolitical moment. The self-governing island is claimed by China, which has vowed to annex it with the use of force if necessary. Since Donald Trump took office as US president in January, the commitment of the US, Taiwan’s main security backer, to helping Taiwan defend itself has been unclear.China frequently rehearses blockades of Taiwan. So-called “grey zone” tactics such as disinformation campaigns have been increasing.Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said Lai also wanted to show that “Taiwan wants to be a partner, not just a recipient, of western largesse”.Lai’s speech came the day after China’s president, Xi Jinping, arrived in Moscow for Russia’s commemoration of the end of the second world war, which will be marked with a military parade featuring Chinese troops on Friday.China’s continuing support for Russia’s war in Ukraine has alarmed western leaders and raised concerns that China could be learning lessons for an invasion of Taiwan.In an article published in Russian media on Wednesday about Chinese and Soviet cooperation during the second world war, Xi devoted a lengthy section to the war’s implications for China’s claims on Taiwan.Xi described this week’s commemorations as “the 80th anniversary of Taiwan’s recovery” to China.“No matter how the situation on the island of Taiwan changes, no matter how external forces disrupt it, the historical trend that China will eventually reunify and will definitely reunify is unstoppable,” Xi wrote.Xi expressed China’s appreciation for Russia’s support for “all measures taken by the Chinese government and people to achieve national reunification”.Additional research by Lillian Yang",

            "content": "The election of Pope Leo XIV has been celebrated across Latin America, where many hailed him as the second pontiff from the region, after his Argentinian predecessor, Francis.The news prompted particular elation in Peru, where he lived and worked for more than 20 years and was granted citizenship in 2015. In the capital, Lima, the bells of the cathedral rang in celebration. \n  In his first appearance from the Vatican balcony, Leo XIV briefly switched from Italian to Spanish to address the faithful “from my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru”, where he served as bishop for more than a decade.Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte, hailed the “historic” election of Leo XIV, whom she described as a Peruvian “by choice and conviction” who had devoted more than 20 years of service to the country. She added that Prevost, 69, “chose to be one of us, to live among us and to carry in his heart the faith, culture and dreams of this country”.She added: “The pope is Peruvian; God loves Peru.”Even so, Prevost has spoken out against Boluarte’s government in the past. In early 2023, he described his “sadness and pain” over the deaths of 49 protesters in anti-government demonstrations that erupted when President Boluarte took office in December 2022, replacing Pedro Castillo who was forced out for attempting to suspend congress.At the time Prevost said the unrest reflected the historic neglect of Peru’s poor, saying: “This conflict does not represent the best of the country.”Pope Leo also called on late former president Alberto Fujimori, who was jailed in 2009 for human rights abuses and corruption to ask for forgiveness from each of his government’s victims in order to begin a process of reconciliation.His suggestion came just two days after Fujimori was given a presidential pardon as part of a political deal and released a video with a half-hearted apology. Prevost pointedly suggested “it would be more effective to ask for forgiveness, personally, for some of the great injustices that were committed and for which he was tried and sentenced”.The controversial ex-leader was sent back to jail in 2018, only to be pardoned again in 2023 amid street protests. He died in 2024 and was given a state funeral.Rosa María Vílchez, 49, who is originally from Chiclayo but now lives in Lima, met Prevost when attending a church service a few years ago.“We knew him by name,” she recalls. “Today I remembered that when I saw him and I really felt like crying because he moved me. He transmits a lot of peace,” said Vílchez, who was collecting her children from school in Villa El Salvador, in the south of the capital.“I hope that he brings a little peace, that he can stabilise the country in some way, because Peruvians are, mainly, very faithful and very Catholic. So, I think he is going to be a figure of political authority,” she added.Cecilia Durand, 55, a publisher in Lima, said: “I’m not Catholic, in fact, there are many things about the church that I am against, but I think this is a good thing for Peru. It’s like winning the World Cup!”As news of Leo’s election began to sink in, social media in Peru was flooded with memes of the pope eating ceviche, Peru’s flagship dish, and drinking Inca Kola, its bubblegum-flavoured soft drink. Others showed him in Peru’s red-and-white football shirt and another humorous image showed the popemobile refashioned as a three-wheeled motorcycle rickshaw, the principal mode of transport in much of the country.Colombia’s interior minister, Armando Benedetti, posted on social media that the years spent in Peru “mean the new pope is once again a Latin American”.Some posts on social media jokingly claimed that the new pope was “more Latino than the entire cast of Emilia Pérez”, referencing the French film that sparked controversy over its portrayal of Mexico.Prevost first came to Peru in 1985, joining the Augustinian mission serving in the prelature in Chulucanas, near the border with Ecuador, until 1986. He returned in 1988, spending the following decade as head of the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo, the country’s third most populous city, also in the north, where he taught canon law and served as a judge on the regional ecclesiastical court.He returned to the US in 1998 and was elected provincial of the Augustinian province of Chicago. He did not return to Peru until 2014 when Pope Francis appointed him as apostolic administrator of the diocese of Chiclayo. The following year, he was named bishop of the city. By 2023 he was promoted to archbishop, then he was made a cardinal in 2024.Janinna Sesa, who met Prevost when she worked for the Catholic charity Caritas, said he was the kind of person who would “put on boots and wade through the mud” to help those most in need – as he did in 2022, when torrential rains affected Chiclayo and nearby villages.He also delivered food and blankets to remote Andean villages, driving a white pickup truck and sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor, she told the Associated Press.Observers say Prevost had a difficult relationship with the Catholic right in Peru, particularly Sodalitium, a far-right Peruvian lay Catholic sect, with a strong presence in the region where he worked. Just before his death, Pope Francis dissolved Sodalitium, after a 50-year history of sexual, psychological and physical abuse, and allegations of malfeasance and corruption.Tiago Rogero, South America correspondent, contributed additional reporting",

            "content": "King Charles called for a renewal of “global commitments to restoring a just peace where there is war, to diplomacy and to the prevention of conflict”, as the UK marked the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day.Westminster Abbey was the focal point for national commemorations with a service of thanksgiving weaving poignant reminders of wartime deprivation and loss with the hopes for the future that historic day had promised.Senior royalty, politicians and military personnel joined 78 second world war veterans as the king led the nation in a two-minute silence at the start of the service. Across the UK, people stood in remembrance on a day that saw ceremonies held throughout Europe.Later, speaking 80 years to the hour after his grandfather George VI’s 9pm address to the nation, Charles said the debt to those “whose firm resolve and fortitude helped destroy nazism and carry our allied nations through to VE Day” could “never truly be repaid”.Addressing the VE 80 concert in Horse Guards Parade, which brought four days of commemorations to a close, he said that as the second world war generation “sadly dwindles”, there was a duty “to carry their stories forward, to ensure their experiences are never to be forgotten”.Repeating Winston Churchill’s words that “meeting jaw to jaw is better than war”, he added we should “rededicate ourselves not only to the cause of freedom but to renewing global commitments to restoring a just peace where there is war, to diplomacy and to the prevention of conflict”.He added: “For, as my grandfather put it: ‘We shall have failed, and the blood of our dearest will have flowed in vain, if the victory which they died to win does not lead to a lasting peace, founded on justice and established in goodwill.’”Charles said: “It falls to us to protect and continue their precious legacy – so that one day hence generations yet unborn may say of us: ‘They too bequeathed a better world.’”Charles also shared a diary entry written by his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on the day after VE Day, which read: “Out in the crowd again. Embankment, Piccadilly. Rained, so fewer people. Conga-ed into House. Sang till 2am Bed at 3am!”He added, to laughter: “I do hope your celebrations tonight are almost as joyful, although I rather doubt I shall have the energy to sing until 2am, let alone lead you all in a giant conga from here back to Buckingham Palace!”Among veterans in the royal box was 107-year-old Harry Richardson, a bomber pilot in the war. Films of other veterans, evacuees and those working on the home front, speaking of their experiences were played.The concert included songs from the wartime era, a Dad’s Army sketch with Daniel Mays, Larry Lamb and Nigel Havers, Brian Cox as Churchill, rock bands The Darkness and Toploader, and singers Fleur East, Tom Walker and bass baritone Willard White.Filmed reminiscences came from a trio of dames in Mary Berry, Joan Collins and Sheila Hancock.Two Vera Lynn classics ended the show, with Calum Scott singing White Cliffs of Dover, and Samantha Barks with We’ll Meet Again. Earlier, inside the abbey, the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, used his address to say the hopes of VE Day and all the good that had come as the result of peace were being tested.“Those first outpourings of joy on the first VE Day led to something good, because in our opposition of what was worst in us, we discovered what was best,” he added. “All this good is under threat again in our world today.”But it was the veterans who were at the heart of the service. Some in wheelchairs, others leaning heavily on sticks, they were presented with white roses, signifying peace, handed to them by six young people.It was a reminder that as time continues to claim first-hand witnesses to the war, the younger generation will shoulder responsibility for remembrance.Echoes of the dark days of war were woven tightly into the order of service.A “procession of witness” saw wartime artefacts from the armed forces and home front carried through the abbey on velvet cushions and carefully placed on the high altar: a D-day map, a set of campaign medals, a naval ratings cap, an RAF flying helmet, an air raid warden’s helmet, a child’s gas mask and a book recording the names of all the civilians killed across the UK.Readings from wartime letters brought history alive.One was from a frontline soldier, Fredrick Burgess, to his seven-year-old son, Freddie. It was written just seven months before the lance corporal was killed in action.Another, from Janet Thornton to her teenage daughters on VE Day, urged them to remember the sacrifice and the importance of the day but also to “shout, scream, sing, wave flags, eat, drink – lemon or barley water – and make it a day of rejoicing”.Her grandson, Colin Vallance-Owens, was in the abbey to hear her words. “She felt very, very seriously that this was a very, very important day for all of us,” he told the BBC.An excerpt from Churchill’s 8 May radio broadcast from the Cabinet Office ricocheted off the abbey’s stone walls. His great-great-grandson, Alexander Churchill, 10, was given the honour of lighting the VE Day candle and read a prayer for “peace in Europe and across the world”.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 22:30",
            "content": "Mikel Merino has vowed Arsenal’s young squad will learn from being eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals and is convinced they will “be back stronger” next season.Paris Saint-Germain booked their place in the final against Inter with a 2-1 win in the second leg, meaning Arsenal will end another campaign without a trophy. They saw off PSV and Real Madrid to reach the last four in the Champions League for the first time since 2009, having been knocked out by Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals last year.“It’s really disappointing because of the mentality of this club, of this squad, is always to try to win big things,” Merino said. “This season is going to be a huge learning curve for us because we have such a young squad, not so much experience in these situations. But having played in the Bernabéu, having played against PSG, it’s going to be a huge learning point for the future. We will be back stronger, we will be back more ready.”Merino said when asked whether you learn more from setbacks and defeats: “That’s completely true; you have to lose first to win later and those experiences are really, really helpful. In the future we will remember these kind of games and remember what is needed to win against top clubs, to win in games you will face in the Champions League and also in the Premier League. So the things someone may think of a setback, we have to look at them as something to learn.”The Spain midfielder has been playing as a makeshift striker owing to injuries, although Mikel Arteta has hinted that Kai Havertz could return from a hamstring injury before the end of the season. Arsenal need seven points from their last three Premier League matches, starting at the champions, Liverpool, on Sunday, to be confirmed as runners-up for a third successive season and Merino said it was important to end on a positive note.“Nobody has the feeling this season is over,” he said. “We know we have big things ahead of us. We need to show to everybody we are still hungry for more. We have to finish the season on a high to go to the summer with a feeling that we can come back stronger.”",

            "content": "They say you cannot win a two-legged tie after just 90 minutes but Sheffield United took a giant step towards the Wembley playoff final showpiece after surging to a 3-0 victory over 10-man Bristol City. For the Blades, who had an early goal questionably chalked off, their task was made considerably easier after the City defender Rob Dickie was sent off on the verge of half-time, allowing Harrison Burrows to strike from the penalty spot and give Chris Wilder’s side a leg-up. In the second half the substitutes Andre Brooks and Callum O’Hare sealed victory.This time the billowing red smoke on the pitch came from the delirious United away end, where the injured homegrown Blades midfielder Ollie Arblaster was among those enjoying themselves. For all of the talk of the gulf between these teams, the 22 points which separated third-placed United and sixth-placed City in the regular season, ultimately the sending-off transformed this match. Now City’s only hopes of reaching the final hinge on an unthinkable – and sizeable – victory on Monday.The rosy picture did not stop Wilder from deliberately dousing his team’s celebrations, pushing his players towards the dressing rooms amid the full-time joy. “I’ve been in the game far too long where, even now, when everyone is thinking it’s job done, it’s not,” he said. “They will come to Bramall Lane, everyone will be writing them off, and that’s a dangerous place to be, so we won’t shortcut it in any way.”These games are always characterised by memorable moments. For Bristol City, it has been 17 years of mostly hurt and mild indifference since David Noble scored a stoppage-time screamer at Selhurst Park to give the club a semi-final first-leg advantage over Crystal Palace. Then came Wembley, where City were defeated by Hull, Dean Windass’s volley one of those sore snapshots that sticks in the memory.United arrived into this tie with a wretched record, too, having failed to prevail in any of their previous nine playoff campaigns. Wilder was on the books of the Blades when their hoodoo began in a relegation playoff defeat against City in 1987-88. “I don’t think half of our players were born,” Wilder said, smiling.So both teams knew what they had signed up for. United saw an early goal dubiously disallowed for offside against Sydie Peck, after Tyrese Campbell thought he had opened the scoring having latched on to Kieffer Moore’s flick from the captain Jack Robinson’s long throw. United’s players had begun celebrating in their numbers when the assistant referee raised his flag on the far side. One away supporter was ejected for letting off a flare, his evening in the West Country over inside a dozen minutes. City responded, Joe Williams sending a first-time rocket against the crossbar, the purest of strikes after good work by Anis Mehmeti.United had a couple more chances before taking the lead from the spot approaching the interval, Campbell and Moore both fluffing their lines.United belatedly led in stoppage time, the referee, Oliver Langford, pointing to the spot after Dickie clumsily upended Moore in the box. Worse still for City, Dickie was given a straight red card, Langford ­adamant the defender did not attempt to play the ball. Moore read the bouncing ball from Campbell’s header and it spelt trouble when he charged between Zak Vyner and Dickie and through on goal. “The decision changed everything,” Liam ­Manning said. “It’s a disgrace – we raised our concerns about the referee this week. We just felt it was too big a game [for him].”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionSuddenly this game had a totally different complexion. Manning recognised as much, making a double change at the interval, introducing Haydon Roberts and Sinclair ­Armstrong. City inevitably struggled to work the United goalkeeper Michael Cooper, a shrewd £2.5m buy from Plymouth, until Mehmeti sent an effort goalwards with 15 minutes of regular time to play. By then Brooks had done a backflip after doubling United’s lead, spying O’Hare’s clever dummy to convert Burrows’s low cross at the back post, and then O’Hare completed the scoring, flicking in from the substitute Tom Davies’s knockdown.City will look to United’s cross-city rivals for inspiration for a miraculous comeback. Two years ago Wednesday overcame a 4-0 first-leg deficit at Hillsborough to beat Peterborough on penalties en route to promotion via Wembley. “I feel for everybody associated with the club,” Manning said. “The lads are gutted. What I do know about them is we’ll keep believing and fighting until the final whistle on Monday.”",

            "content": "Who are you and what have you done with Ange Postecoglou? There was a messy goal from a set piece, another from a mishit cross, a plan with pragmatism at its core and a team able to find beauty in the kind of ugly performance that has so often left Postecoglou cold.All the cool came from Tottenham Hotspur in the Arctic Circle. They were robust rather than flimsy on the infamous plastic pitch at the Aspmyra Stadium, serious rather than spectacular, and they did not mind turning this Europa League semi-final against punchy, determined Bodo/Glimt into a grind. Postecoglou, the manager with supposedly no clue how to kill a game, came up trumps. Spurs were dogged, streetwise and smart in unpleasant conditions in northern Norway and, after a season of such strife in the Premier League, their reward is an all-English final against Manchester United later this month.Europe remains a sanctuary for Postecoglou’s team. They have been erratic and chaotic domestically but they have summoned resilience in this competition. Bodø/Glimt never had hope of a comeback. Kjetil Knutsen’s side were outmuscled by stronger, sharper opponents. Spurs rose to the challenge, goals from Dominic Solanke and Pedro Porro enough for them to win 2-0 on the night and 5-1 on aggregate. Adversity has brought out the best in them. Postecoglou has been ridiculed this season but vindication is within reach for the Spurs manager, even if there is rising speculation that the Australian will be sacked even if he secures Champions League qualification by beating United in Bilbao.Maybe this will be a healing moment, though. There were joyous scenes at full time, the Spurs players surging across the pitch to celebrate with the 404 hardy souls in the away end, and there is a chance that the memories created by this run could repair Postecoglou’s relationship with the fanbase. Who knows how much winning a trophy could change this troubled club’s self-image? Plenty of people, after all, had tipped them to mess up this tie. Even the locals thought that Spurs had not built up a big enough lead in the first leg.This remote, windswept Arctic outpost had never experienced anything quite this momentous before. The sprinklers were on long before kick-off, drenching a surface already designed to play quickly. The rain fell too, heightening the sense that this place is designed to trip up unsuspecting visitors. It was easy to see why Porto, Besiktaş, Maccabi Tel Aviv, Twente, Olympiakos and Lazio had already left this quirky little ground empty-handed this season.Buoyed by the return of the influential duo of Patrick Berg and Håkon Evjen from suspension in midfield, Bodø/Glimt believed a 3-1 deficit would be wiped out. Reality soon intruded on the fairytale. Spurs were first to settle, with Richarlison causing problems for Fredrik Sjøvold on the left, and were closing to pulling clear when Porro almost curled a free-kick past Nikita Haikin in the ninth minute.Knutsen admitted that Spurs were in charge from the start. Postecolgou was delighted with his side’s pressing. It was six years to the day since Spurs pulled off their miraculous comeback against Ajax in the semi-finals of the Champions League but this was more sedate. Richarlison continued to threaten, Solanke’s hold-up play was impressive and there was an escape for the hosts when Destiny Udogie failed to find anyone after sneaking through on the left.Calm and professional, Spurs were using the ball well, even with injuries stripping their midfield of the poise offered by James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall. Dejan Kulusveski, Maddison’s replacement, disrupted Bodø/Glimt’s attempts to play out from the back. Yves Bissouma and Rodrigo Bentancur mopped up in front of the back four. The only misstep came when Brennan Johnson picked up a booking for a clumsy challenge.Bodø/Glimt were too frantic. Ole Didrik Blomberg fired into the side-netting and Berg forced Guglielmo Vicario to tip a free-kick over but there was not much to worry Spurs before half-time.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionThe curious thing is that Postecoglou has not hesitated to dispense with his idealistic approach in Europe. Spurs have sat back and been more direct against continental opposition, particularly on their travels. Ruggedness was a prominent feature of their quarter-final win over Eintracht Frankfurt and they did a similar job on Bodø/Glimt. It was not long before Maurizio Mariano, the Italian referee, was warning Vicario about timewasting before a goal-kick.Spurs, 16th in the league, were unperturbed. Diligent and disciplined, they led in the 64th minute. Mathys Tel, who had just replaced Richarlison, delivered a corner, Cristian Romero won the first header and Solanke bundled the ball in from close range.Bodø/Glimt, the first Norwegian side to go this far in Europe, knew it was a lost cause. The second goal soon arrived, Porro’s cross catching Haikin out of position. Postecoglou’s promise about always winning a trophy in his second season looks increasingly convincing.",

            "content": "Chelsea’s status as London’s prime European trophy hunters remains inarguable. Winning this season’s Conference League would add to a set of two European Cups, two Europa Leagues and having twice been ­winners of the old Cup Winners’ Cup.If Uefa’s minor competition is not meant for global super-clubs, more clubs such as Djurgården, swept aside easily over two legs, Blues fans can look forward to an eighth European final, having won six of seven. It is a haul Arsenal fans licking painful wounds from Paris can only dream of.Progress to the Wroclaw final came on a night without tension but full of atmosphere, mostly coming from the visiting Swedish fans. Expectation can be a passion killer and Chelsea’s Conference League campaign has been full of quiet Thursdays. The Swedish contingent lit up the night with noise and fervour. They had determined to make the most of their Conference League experience.Abde Ezzalzouli (pictured) emerged as Real Betis' hero after he scored an extra-time winner to make them the first Spanish side to reach the Conference League final with a 4-3 aggregate victory over Fiorentina, setting up a showdown with Chelsea.The Italian hosts faced an uphill task of overturning a first-leg deficit after Betis won 2-1 in Seville last week.Betis increased their advantage when Antony scored on the half-hour mark with a stunning free-kick, curling the ball over the wall and in off the post.Fiorentina then managed to draw level thanks to two Robin Gosen headed goals within eight minutes. The German headed in from a corner in the 34th minute and then outjumped Marc Bartra to find the top corner to drag the match into extra time.Betis ultimately edged through with a 2-2 result on the night after Ezzalzouli scored in the 97th minute from Antony's cross, sending Betis to the final in Wroclaw, Poland, on May 28. ReutersFor Enzo Maresca, failure to lift the trophy on 28 May would still register as an abject failure and count against any designs on lasting longer than a single season. His bosses have designs on playing on rather grander stages but the Italian moved a step closer towards one of the season’s objectives. There, the former Sevilla player will face Real Betis, coached by his mentor, Manuel Pellegrini, “my professional dad”.Maresca described reaching the final as “a starting point for a winning mentality and then to try to win more and more titles hopefully in the future” before looking ahead to Sunday’s noon assignment. “Now, the most important game has become Newcastle,” he said. “We have 20 days to prepare the final, and we have to see game after game.”That the Champions League is top priority was laid bare by Maresca’s selection, ten changes made from Liverpool on Sunday. A three-goal margin was calculated – correctly – to be enough. A first start for Reggie Walsh, 16 and within his GCSE study period. Walsh, who looks yet younger, became the youngest Chelsea player to start a European match. Before kick-off, the captain, Reece James, hugged his young teammate, as if offering fatherly advice.Djurgården’s away contingent, in the corner of the Shed End, were determined to show off ultra credentials at a stadium once one of the cathedrals of terrace culture. The modern Stamford Bridge, with pre-match tunnel club, barely resembles the Football Factory the visitors might recall from their DVD collection. Noise, brandished scarves and firework smoke filled the west ­London air.Could their heroes land an early blow to strike tension into the tie? When August Priske won a loose ball on the right and laid up Tokmac Nguen, it momentarily felt possible, only for the Norwegian to balloon his effort. The excitement around that attack made clear DIF fans were dotted around the Bridge, including in corporate sections. Many semi-final tickets had landed in the wrong – if willing – hands.DF’s fans and their team ended the night in loud synchronicity, applauding each other’s efforts, as club anthems were bellowed lustily. “I was disappointed for a while,” said their coach Jani Honkavaara. “But when we saw their reaction, I think we all felt we could be proud of a long campaign.”Walsh had completed the full 90, having not looked at all overawed. “He was fantastic, composed,” said Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, his manager yet more effusive, uncharacteristically so. Maresca said: “I love him because he’s that kind of a player I want to play in my system, he’s perfect.”Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionMarc Cucurella had partnered James in midfield as Chelsea dominated first-half play before, after, the 19-year-old striker Tyrique George’s turn and pass, Dewsbury-Hall ran free to guide the ball home.Despite the tie being over as a contest, the second half resumed with yet louder Swedish noise. Cucurella had been withdrawn, overseeing role completed, and the teenager Shumaira Mheuka came on to the lead the line.A consolation goal might have blown the roof off but the team estimated to be worth 44 times their opponents defended tightly as the majority of the entertainment value remained in the stands.With 20 minutes to play, James was removed for Trevoh Chalobah, and in place of Sancho, on came Genesis Antwi, the 17-year-old facing opposition from his Stockholm birthplace as five teenagers completed the job. “Fantastic for the academy, fantastic for the future,” said their manager.Maresca’s use of flowering youth suggested bright days ahead for the Chelsea project – or pure profit, depending on the business model. A final date in Poland is among them.",

            "content": "The Mason Mount strike that sealed Manchester United’s Europa League final berth was as sublime as Ruben Amorim’s team were slipshod until the substitute took charge.With 72 minutes gone, Leny Yoro prodded the ball to Mount who, with the sweetest touch of his right instep, swivelled, then bent the equaliser past the helpless Julen Agirrezabala.A jubilant Mount ran to the ecstatic Stretford End, Amorim punched a hand, and Athletic Bilbao were 4-1 down on aggregate. They were soon four behind, as Bruno Fernandes chipped a free-kick from the right to the near post where Casemiro stooped and headed in.Rasmus Højlund’s tap-in came courtesy of the effervescent Amad Diallo’s cross, before Mount’s 45-yard arrow that made it 7-1 overall and vanquished the spectre of the mother of all collapses and means United face off against Tottenham at Athletic’s San Mamés Stadium on Wednesday week.Forget lose their “mind”, as Amorim admitted United can do, they would need to misplace arms, legs and boots to cede a 3-0, first-leg advantage to a team missing their finest quartet in Iñaki and Nico Williams, Oihan Sancet and Dani Vivian. And so it proved.Mount came on 10 minutes before his equaliser, part of a triple substitution alongside Diallo and Luke Shaw that, to Amorim’s immense credit, swung the match.Given the Portuguese’s admission that his players freeze here, the last thing required was encouragement to the almost 4,000 Los Leones fans who crammed their quadrant and whose noise informed their team they still believed.A sliced André Onana pass, which went for a throw, boxed United in and led to an Athletic chance only eight minutes in, was, then, anathema. The ball was worked to the lively Álex Berenguer, who had Onana’s goal gaping before him: but the No 7’s composure went missing.From this juncture, more pressure featured another errant Onana pass and Berenguer firing in a free-kick that United’s goalkeeper fisted away. To break out, Amorim’s men would hope for a quick counter all evening, as when Casemiro slickly back-heeled to Bruno Fernandes – he fed Patrick Dorgu, Athletic were turned, and United thundered forward.The right wing-back tapped to Højlund, whose curving run created space, and a miscontrol-then-pass to Fernandes allowed the captain to unload a shot that was blocked.Two more United breaks followed and each ended with Amorim wringing his hands as sloppy play gave up possession. The second time, ­Berenguer was able to run from inside his territory to 20 yards from goal: the effort bounced wide but those in red were warned.Sign up to Football DailyKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballafter newsletter promotionThis happened as the half-hour approached so it was so far, so (just about) good. But then disaster: United once more lost the ball upfield, it was hoofed forward, and Harry Maguire, after an aimless Maroan Sannadi header, was in control. Yet a wild crossfield pass meant for Leny Yoro went to Álvaro Djaló and when his attempt rebounded to Mikel ­Jauregizar, the No 23 blazed home from 25 yards, Onana’s ­fingertips steering it in.Athletic’s fans partied and the comeback felt on. United needed to reach the safe harbour of half-time with no more goals conceded. Manuel Ugarte decided the best way was to surge forward, as he did through the middle – the ball went to Alejandro Garnacho, who squared, but Dorgu failed to finish. So, too, Garnacho when spurning a gilded opening to restore United’s three-goal lead: the winger’s sprint for Dorgu’s through ball was smart, the lob that went wide certainly not. The crowed “oohed” and the 20-year-old shook his head as he considered how costly it might prove.Garnacho went close to discovering the answer nearly straight away when Unai Gómez spun a low shot that Onana only just clutched and so the players wandered off knowing the second half would be as frantic.Amorim’s players are not adept at keep-ball, yet doing so for even a few minutes would allow them to recover and arrest Athletic’s relentlessness. But the pattern continued as the visitors added to their compendium of chances, the next a Berenguer free-kick spiralled in from the left that no colleague could profit from. Then Gómez appeared to be in on goal before Noussair Mazraoui stepped across and, moments later, the ubiquitous Berenguer dipped in a corner that the home rearguard barely scrambled out.United were in siege mode, pinned in their half and desperate for respite so Amorim made the three match-changing substitutions. Off went Mazraoui, Ugarte and Garnacho for Shaw, Mount and Diallo, whose zigzagging foray down the right, seconds later, was an augury of what would follow. After United’s nerves jangled again, when Unai Núñez headed marginally past Onana’s right post, came Mount’s two best moments in United colours, together with Casemiro’s and Højlund’s goals.",

            "content": "This tribute to case-of-the week crime dramas is so nearly a brilliant TV show. Starring Natasha Lyonne (Orange Is the New Black, Russian Doll) as Charlie Cale, a woman with a foolproof ability to tell truth from falsehood, the series follows in the footsteps of classic story-of-the-week crime dramas; each episode features a tranche of excellent guest stars and a freshly covered-up misdeed for our thoroughly charming citizen-detective to uncover. With her gravelly-chipmunk New York tones – or “voice like a rusty clarinet”, as one character has it – Lyonne ensures Cale is an idiosyncratically charismatic protagonist you can really get behind. She’s cool: her catchphrase is “bullshit” and her aesthetic is 1970s-hued indie sleaze; shades, spray-on jeans, biker boots, shrunken T-shirts, wild, matted hair. She’s chaotically good, too: mischievous enough to bend the rules but essentially golden-hearted, in possession of an old-timey garrulousness and an inability to let things lie. What’s not to love?The mysteries themselves, mainly. Most episodes of Poker Face – which was created by Knives Out director Rian Johnson, although he is not a credited writer on this second season – involve a 10ish-minute Cale-free opening, during which the viewer bears witness to a crime, usually a murder. Afterwards, we discover how our hero came to be acquainted with both the perpetrators and victims. Since the end of the very first episode, Cale has been on the run: first from a shady casino boss who wanted her dead (she was involved in the destruction of his business and the suicide of his son); then, as of the start of this new season, another shady casino boss who wants to exploit her lie-detection skills. To evade capture, she zigzags across the States at random – and into the path of a host of inadvertent murderers.As a setup, it’s knowingly ludicrous. Yet while Poker Face’s crimes are all archly odd – variously involving pilfered breast milk, clearly robotic alligators and five sisters all played by Cynthia Erivo – they are not quite wacky enough to qualify as pastiches of the vintage murder mysteries (Columbo, Magnum, PI, Murder, She Wrote) they pay homage to. The action is amusing rather than laugh out loud (why cast the outrageously hilarious Patti Harrison then not give her a single funny line?), yet too camply stylised to be dramatically absorbing either.This would be less of a problem if said mysteries were clever or complex or surprising enough to work on their own terms. Unfortunately, they range only from tediously predictable to moderately diverting. Like Columbo, Poker Face is not a whodunnit or a whydunnit, but a “howcatchem” – we watch to see how the protagonist unravels the riddle. This means no shocks or twists for the audience, something viewers have grown to expect from other anthology-type series like Black Mirror and Inside No 9. Again, this lack of jeopardy would be fine if the solving was done artfully or ingeniously. But Cale’s approach only draws partially on her mind-reading talents – which, as she points out, are limited to spotting dishonesty rather than unearthing truth – and mainly hinges on an ability to pick up on vague clues: her final exposé is often a result of a sudden realisation that has nothing to do with her special powers.Despite the variety of settings – a gym, a baseball stadium, a cabaret theatre, a police awards ceremony – and a multitude of high-profile guests (among them Katie Holmes, Awkwafina, John Mulaney, Melanie Lynskey, Steve Buscemi and Alia Shawkat, enjoying herself immensely), the mechanics can feel repetitive. Cale is often some kind of waitress in the venue where the crime took place; she needs cash-in-hand jobs to survive her itinerant lifestyle. There are multiple instances of somebody spiking a rival, and numerous plots involve people demanding hush money to keep schtum. The dampening effect of this formulaic approach is brought into sharp focus by the straightforwardly great episodes that don’t follow it: one gratifyingly unpredictable instalment involving Cale’s apprehension by crime boss Beatrix Hasp (a fantastic Rhea Perlman), who demands she help expunge a rat (or is it a mole? Or perhaps a snake?) from her gang of heavies before they attempt to flee the country, and another about a group of old-school con artists that blessedly doesn’t spell out its final denouement in advance.These are the episodes that are the most frustrating, because they prove how well Poker Face could work. More intricately plotted murders, more inspired crime-solving and a few more surprises for the audience, and we would have that rare thing: a gripping and genuinely fun detective thriller with an enchanting, one-of-a-kind guide. Poker Face aired on Sky Max and is on Now in the UK. In the US, it airs on Peacock. In Australia, it airs on Stan.",

            "content": "The internet exploded with humor and Chicago pride on Thursday following the historic announcement that Robert Francis Prevost, a 69-year-old American clergyman from Chicago, has been named the new pope.Now known as Pope Leo XIV, Prevost has become the first clergyman from the United States to lead the Roman Catholic church, ending the Vatican’s longstanding opposition to the idea of a US pontiff.Reactions quickly flooded social media platforms like X and Bluesky, with Chicagoans and Americans across the country chiming in, and sharing jokes.The Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, celebrated the moment on social media, posting: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.”Other users asked for “photos of the new pope at the Bean” Chicago’s famous sculpture, while MSNBC’s Chris Hayes wondered whether the pope was a Chicago Cubs fan, as others asked if he was a White Sox fan.One X user joked: “In honor of Chicago’s own Pope Leo XIV, the White Sox announce the new ‘White Smoke Shake’ that will be served in a commemorative pope hat.” Another poked fun at the Chicago Bears American Football team, writing: “Chicago produced a pope before a QB who throws for 4,000 yards.”In honor of Chicago’s own Pope Leo XIV, the White Sox announce the new “White Smoke Shake” that will be served in a commemorative pope hat pic.twitter.com/JnMVxtQ7pDOthers referenced Chicago’s famous deep dish pizza, joking about the pope serving deep dish pizza and to ask whether the new pope thinks that Chicago or Rome have better pizza.“From now on, all communion wafers shall be deep dish,” one commenter wrote. Another added: “Deep dish eucharist” and another user joked that “finally Rome will have good pizza”.New Pope serving the body of Christ at mass pic.twitter.com/retLuaWp0oA nod to the city’s notorious liqueur appeared, too, with some people asking whether the pope had consumed Malört, a liqueur once reserved for Chicago dive bars.“Cannot wait for holy water & wine to be replaced by Malort & Old Style,” one user wrote.There were also references to The Bear, the Emmy-winning Chicago-based drama, and to Second City, the city’s pioneering and legendary comedy club, with one user stating that “second City now only second to Vatican City”.Someone also joked that Pope Leo XIV “has probably eaten more hot dogs than all 266 previous popes combined”.A social media account associated with the New York Knicks also celebrated that the new pope was a graduate of Villanova University, writing: “What a week for Villanova graduates”with a photo of the Pope alongside images of the Knicks players Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges, who are also Villanova alums. The New York basketball team won the first two games against the Boston Celtics in the playoffs.What a week for Villanova graduates pic.twitter.com/UHZesaME96Corporate accounts also joined in.

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 21:31",
            "content": "A federal judge has awarded more than $680,000 to 17 families who say they were sickened by a leak from a second-world-war era fuel tank into a US navy drinking water system in Hawaii in 2021.The bellwether cases set the legal tone for another 7,500 military family members, civilians and service members whose lawsuits are still awaiting resolution.US district judge Leslie Kobayashi handed down the ruling on Wednesday, awarding from $5,000 to more than $104,000 to each plaintiff. In her order, Kobayashi wrote that it was clear that even though the contaminated water could have caused many of the kinds of medical problems the military families experienced, there was not enough evidence to prove a direct link.The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the navy and to Honolulu’s municipal water system.In 2021, jet fuel gushed from a ruptured pipe in the military-run tank farm, leaking into a well that supplied water to housing and offices in and around the sprawling base. About 6,000 people suffered nausea, headaches, rashes and other symptoms.The amount awarded to each of plaintiff was significantly smaller than the roughly $225,000 to $1.25m that their attorney, Kristina Baehr, requested during the two-week trial in federal court in Honolulu.As bellwether plaintiffs, the 17 were chosen because they were seen as representative of the thousands of other people whose cases are still pending.Baehr called the damage awards disappointing but said the families “prevailed against all odds against the US Government”.“These families can be proud that they helped prove to the world what truly happened when the Navy poisoned the water supply near Pearl Harbor and sickened so many,” Baehr said in a news release. “The Court rejected the Government’s argument that thousands of our clients were just psychosomatic and that there was not enough fuel to make anyone sick.”Baehr said the legal team was reviewing options for resolving the thousands of remaining cases.The government admitted liability for the spill before the trial began, but its attorneys disputed whether the plaintiffs were exposed to enough jet fuel to cause the vomiting, rashes and other alleged negative health effects.",

            "content": "Director James Foley, whose credits included Glengarry Glen Ross and the Fifty Shades sequels, has died aged 71.According to the Hollywood Reporter, his death was confirmed by his representative who said he died “peacefully in his sleep earlier this week following a years-long struggle with brain cancer”.His career was marked by versatility, from music videos with Madonna to commercial multiplex thrillers to talky TV dramas to erotic romances.He made his directorial debut with the romantic drama Reckless in 1984, which starred Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah. It was an acrimonious start to his big-screen career with the film receiving negative reviews and angering screenwriter Chris Columbus, who disowned it.He received better notices for his follow-up, crime drama At Close Range, which starred Sean Penn and Christopher Walken. In the same year, he also started working with Madonna, who was married to Penn at the time. Foley was the best man at their wedding.He directed the videos for Live to Tell, Papa Don’t Preach and True Blue as well as the 1987 screwball comedy Who’s That Girl, which starred the singer alongside Griffin Dunne.In the 1990s, he directed an episode of Twin Peaks before films such as David Mamet adaptation Glengarry Glen Ross, John Grisham drama The Chamber and Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon thriller Fear.The 2000s saw him direct Confidence with Dustin Hoffman and Perfect Stranger with Halle Berry before the 2010s had him directing episodes of House of Cards and Billions, as well as taking on the two Fifty Shades of Grey sequels.“Seriously, if you cast the right friggin’ people and they’re good actors, it’s amazing how little you have to do but stay out of the way,” Foley said modestly of his career in a 2003 interview.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/white-smoke-signals-election-of-new-roman-catholic-pope",
            "published_at": "2025-05-8 21:08",
            "content": "Robert Prevost, the first US cleric to lead the Roman Catholic church, has said “evil will not prevail” as he addressed a crowd of 100,000 pilgrims and tourists in his first speech as Pope Leo XIV from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica.The stunning election on Thursday of Prevost, who is 69 years old, as the church’s 267th pontiff, ended the Vatican’s longstanding opposition to the idea of a pontiff from the US.Observers said the Chicago-born cleric’s papal name historically symbolised strength during crisis, and could be taken as a sign that he would probably follow in the footsteps of Pope Francis, who died in April aged 88.Donald Trump, who on Saturday angered Catholics by posting an AI-generated picture of himself as pope on social media, was among the first world leaders to congratulate Prevost, even though the pair looked set to clash in a similar way that the US president did with Francis.“It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”Prevost, who in his first speech called for “peace” and “to build bridges”, has previously criticised the Trump administration’s treatment of refugees and migrants, saying in a recent post that the US government did not “see the suffering” in its policies.His first words to the raucous crowd celebrating in St Peter’s Square were “peace be with you all”. “I would like peace to reach your families, all peoples, all the earth,” he said, speaking in Italian, then switching to Spanish – and saying not a word in English.“Peace be with you. A disarmed, disarming, humble peace. God loves us all, unconditionally.”Referring to the final blessing that Francis gave from the same balcony on Easter Sunday, the day before his death, Leo added: “Evil will not prevail: we are all in God’s hands … The world needs his light … Help us build bridges, with dialogue, to always be at peace.”In response to news of his election, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said he hoped the Vatican would maintain “moral and spiritual support” under the new pope’s leadership.“At this decisive moment for our country, we hope for the continued moral and spiritual support of the Vatican in Ukraine’s efforts to restore justice and achieve a lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X.Prevost was also lauded in rather more jocular fashion by the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, who wrote on X: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.”Prevost was elected as pontiff by at least two-thirds of the 133 cardinal voters who had been locked in the Sistine Chapel on the second day of the papal conclave, after the fourth ballot. The process was completed quickly, especially given the large number of cardinals taking part in the conclave.Prevost was made a cardinal by Francis in 2023 and presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms the Argentinian pope made, when he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the pope.He was former leader of the Augustinian order and was also appointed by Francis to the powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which oversees the selection of new bishops from around the world.It is believed those senior roles, combined with Prevost’s experience in Peru, where he lived for more than 20 years, serving as bishop of the northern city of Chiclayo and becoming a Peruvian citizen, may have redeemed him in the eyes of those who would not usually countenance the idea of a US pope.In his speech to the faithful on Thursday, he mostly spoke in Italian, but switched to Spanish to address the people of his former diocese of Chiclayo. His election prompted elation in Peru, where the bells of the cathedral in capital, Lima, rang out, and president Dina Boluarte declared: “The Pope is Peruvian; God loves Peru!”Politically, he has made no secret of his distaste for the US government’s policies. In February he also shared on X an op-ed published in the National Catholic Reporter titled “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others,” after comments the US vice-president made in an interview on Fox News.On Thursday, Vance wrote on X: “Congratulations to Leo XIV, the first American Pope, on his election! I’m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”Christine Allen, the director of the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (Cafod) charity, said Leo would be “a voice of wisdom in a fractured and divided world as he continues the important work of leading the church in the world and providing spiritual and moral guidance to the global community”.She added: “Having spent years in Peru, Pope Leo XIV brings with him the vital perspective of the global south, elevating voices from the margins to centre stage.“Now more than ever, the world needs a strong and steadfast moral voice that can draw attention to the most important issues in our world: the crippling debt crisis – a key focus of this jubilee year – which prevents low-income countries from spending on health and education for their people; the climate crisis and the conflicts blighting our world.”Eric LeCompte, the executive director of the religious development group Jubilee USA Network, who advises Vatican and Catholic church leadership said he expected Leo to “follow the path that Francis set to build a more inclusive and transparent Church”.“The selection of the name of Leo XIV is a special acknowledgment of the need to support the poor and workers,” LeCompte added.The new pontiff will have many urgent issues to address. A priority will be to strengthen the church’s unity amid differing views and expectations within the institution and growing polarisation in the wider world.The pontiff plays an important role on the international stage, aiming to ensure that religion does not become a faultline.He takes on the role amid ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan plus the politically divisive issues of migration, the climate crisis, religious freedom and human rights.The legacy of sexual abuse cast a long shadow over Francis’s papacy. He was slow to grasp the scale and systemic nature of the problem, and Pope Leo XIV’s approach will inevitably also come under intense scrutiny.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 20:59",
            "content": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) will no longer track the cost of climate crisis-fueled weather disasters, including floods, heatwaves, wildfires and more. It is the latest example of changes to the agency and the Trump administration limiting federal government resources on climate change.Noaa falls under the US Department of Commerce and is tasked with daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings and climate monitoring. It is also parent to the National Weather Service.The agency said its National Centers for Environmental Information would no longer update its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database beyond 2024, and that its information – going as far back as 1980 – would be archived.For decades, it has tracked hundreds of major events across the country, including destructive hurricanes, hailstorms, droughts and freezes that have totaled trillions of dollars in damage.The database uniquely pulls information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (Fema) assistance data, insurance organizations, state agencies and more to estimate overall losses from individual disasters.Noaa’s communications director, Kim Doster, said in a statement that the change was “in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes”.In a separate development on Thursday, Fema’s acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was pushed out and replaced by another official from the Department of Homeland Security, a day after he testified on Capitol Hill that he did not agree with proposals to dismantle Fema, which Donald Trump has threatened to do.Scientists say extreme weather events are becoming increasingly more frequent, costly and severe with the climate crisis. Experts have attributed the growing intensity of recent debilitating heat, Hurricane Milton, the southern California wildfires and blasts of cold to the climate crisis.Assessing the impact of weather events fueled by the planet’s warming is key as insurance premiums rise, particularly in communities more prone to flooding, storms and fires. The climate crisis has wreaked havoc on the insurance industry, and homeowners are at risk of soaring rates.One limitation is that the dataset estimated only the nation’s most costly weather events.The information is generally seen as standardized and unduplicable, given the agency’s access to non-public data, and other private databases would be more limited in scope and likely not shared as widespread for proprietary reasons. Other datasets, however, also track death estimates from these disasters.Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections, pointed to substitutes from insurance brokers and the international disaster database as alternative sources of information.Still, “the Noaa database is the gold standard we use to evaluate the costs of extreme weather,” Masters said, “and it’s a major loss, since it comes at a time when we need to better understand how much climate change is increasing disaster losses.”These moves also do not “change the fact that these disasters are escalating year over year”, Kristina Dahl, the vice-president of science at non-profit climate organization Climate Central. “Extreme weather events that cause a lot of damage are one of the primary ways that the public sees that climate change is happening and is affecting people.“It’s critical that we highlight those events when they’re happening,” she added. “All of these changes will make Americans less safe in the face of climate change.”The move, reported on Thursday by CNN, is yet another of Trump’s efforts to remove references to the climate crisis and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the weather from the federal government’s lexicon and documents.The president has instead prioritized allies in the polluting coal, oil and gas industries, which studies say are linked or traced to climate damage.The Trump administration fired hundreds of weather forecasters and other federal Noaa employees on probationary status in February, part of Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” efforts to downsize the federal government workforce. It began a second round of more than 1,000 cuts at the agency in March, more than 10% of its workforce at the time.At the time, insiders said mass firings and changes to the agency would risk lives and negatively affect the US economy. Experts also noted fewer vital weather balloon launches under Noaa would worsen US weather forecasts.More changes to the agency are expected, which could include some of those proposed in the president’s preliminary budget.The agency’s weather service also paused providing language translations of its products last month – though it resumed those translations just weeks later.",

            "content": "Robert Francis Prevost – who has chosen the papal name Leo XIV – may not be the Latin American Jesuit wildcard that his predecessor, Pope Francis, was, but his election is similarly historic.In the figure of the 69-year-old former head of the Augustinian order, the Roman Catholic church has its very first US leader. Until Thursday evening, the idea of the fisherman’s ring being slipped on to a North American hand was seen as a fairly distant possibility. The Vatican’s longstanding opposition to a US pope stemmed largely from the optics of having a pontiff from a political superpower and a country with such a hegemonic cultural and secular global influence.But all that changed after a short conclave that chose a man who had been a cardinal for only a little more than two years. While his appointment is likely to be welcomed by progressive factions within the church, it was probably not the news that some of his more conservative, Trump-aligned US brother cardinals had been hoping for.Despite being born in Chicago on 14 September 1955, Prevost has never been a typical US Catholic cleric – not least because he also holds Peruvian citizenship. After giving his solemn vows in 1981 and studying in Rome, he was sent to a mission in Peru. He would go on to spend many years there as judicial vicar and as a professor of canon, patristic and moral law at a seminary in Peru’s third city, Trujillo, before being appointed bishop of another northern city, Chiclayo, in November 2014.Those who know him from his time in Peru – where the church has often been beset by tensions between leftwing proponents of liberation theology and uber-traditionalist Catholics – recall a calm and grounded leader who would sit down to breakfast with his fellow priests after morning prayers.“No matter how many problems he has, he maintains good humour and joy,” the Rev Fidel Purisaca Vigil, the communications director for Prevost’s old diocese in Chiclayo, told the Associated Press.As a recent profile in Crux noted, Prevost acquired a reputation over the years as a hard-working and “moderating influence” among Peru’s ideologically disparate bishops, a talent that will prove invaluable during his papacy.In September 2023, Francis – who himself had to manage competing theological strains during his time as leader of the Jesuits in the turbulent, violent and oppressive Argentina of the 1970s – made Prevost a cardinal.Until Thursday evening, Prevost’s most high-profile Vatican roles had been as president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, which oversees the selection of new bishops from around the world.His strong connection to Latin America, combined with his more recent roles at the top of the church, may have gone a long way in endearing him to those who would not usually countenance the idea of a US pope.Prevost’s recent CV also makes clear his proximity to Francis and he will doubtless be seen by many as a surprise, if welcome, kind of continuity candidate.Donald Trump, who hailed the appointment, calling the arrival of the first US pope “a Great Honor for our Country”, seldom saw eye-to-eye with Francis. The late pope was forthright in his criticism of Trump’s border and immigration policies – not least his desire to wall off Mexico.“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis said in February 2016. “This is not the gospel.”The blunt rebuke did not land well with Trump. “For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful,” he said in response. “No leader, especially a religious leader, has the right to question another man’s religion or faith.”Whether Trump is right to be looking forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV – “it will be a very meaningful moment!” – will depend on the degree to which the new bishop of Rome emulates his predecessor.Towards the beginning of his widely admired papacy, Francis insisted that the church should not be remote, nor cloistered, nor complacent in its relationship with the world.“‘Mere administration’ can no longer be enough,” he wrote. “Throughout the world, let us be ‘permanently in a state of mission’.” Francis was adamant that the church he led for 12 years would be a church for “todos, todos, todos” (everyone, everyone, everyone). He also said he preferred a church “which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security”.More than a decade on, the streets – from Gaza and Ukraine to Sudan and Kashmir – have only become more bloody and more violent. As he addressed the world from the loggia of St Peter’s Basilica on Thursday, Pope Leo XIV’s first words were: “Peace be with you.”His subsequent message, stressing the importance of peace, dialogue and missionary evangelisation, befitted the former leader of a mendicant order dedicated to poverty, service and pastoral work. But in his plea for peace to “enter your hearts, to reach your families and all people, wherever they are”, there was also, perhaps, more than a trace of his much-loved and much-missed predecessor. This article was amended on 9 May 2025. Robert Prevost was made a cardinal in September 2023, not January as an earlier version stated.",

He sounded worried, as if he had been crying. He told his sister he might be transferred somewhere else soon.No one has heard from him since.Within hours of that call, Jerce was forced on a plane to El Salvador and booked into the country’s most notorious prison: the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (Cecot). He was one of more than 260 men that Donald Trump’s administration had accused of terrorism and gang membership. His sister thought she recognized him in the videos shared by the Salvadorian government, among the crowd of deportees with shaved heads and white prison uniforms, being frogmarched to their cells by guards in ski masks. Then CBS News published a leaked list of the deportees’ names, confirming her worst worries.“It was a shock,” said Joregelis. “Jerce has always avoided trouble.”Jerce, a 36-year-old professional soccer player and father of two, had come to the US last year to seek asylum, after fleeing political violence and repression in Venezuela.An immigration hearing to review his case was scheduled for 17 April, just weeks after he was abruptly exiled to El Salvador.“He was so optimistic, up till the last day we spoke,” said Mariyin Araujo, Jerce’s ex-partner and the co-parent of his two daughters, Isabella and six-year-old Carla.“He believed the laws there in the US were the best, that it would all work out soon,” she said. “How far did that get him?”Barrios was flown to Cecot on 15 March. For the past two months, his family has been obsessively scanning news updates and social media posts for any sign that he is still alive and healthy. They have been closely monitoring the court cases challenging Trump’s invocation of the wartime powers of the Alien Enemies Act against the Venezuela-based gang known as Tren de Aragua, to exile immigrants – most of whom have no criminal history – to one of the most notorious prisons in the world. And they have been wondering what, if anything, they can do for Jerce.In Machiques, a small town near Venezuela’s border with Colombia, locals have painted a mural in Jerce’s honor. His old soccer club, Perijaneros FC, started a campaign demanding his release – and children from the local soccer school held a prayer circle for him. “We have created TikToks about him, we have organized protests, we held vigils,” said Araujo.“We have looked for so many ways to be his voice at this moment, when he is unable to speak,” she said.But as the weeks pass, she said, she is increasingly unsure what more she can do. The Trump administration has doubled down on its right to send immigrants to Cecot, despite a federal judge’s order barring it from doing so.To justify these extraordinary deportations, both Trump and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, have publicly insisted that the men sent to Cecot are the worst of the worst gang members. To mark Trump’s first 100 days in office, his Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released a list of “Noteworthy individuals deported or prevented from entering the US” – and characterized Jerce as “a member of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang” who “has tattoos that are consistent with those indicating membership” in the gang.Jerce’s family and lawyer say the only evidence DHS has shared so far is that he has a tattoo on his arm of a soccer ball with a crown on top – a tribute to his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid. His other tattoos include the names of his parents, siblings and daughters.“My brother is not a criminal,” Joregelis said. “They took him away without any proof. They took him because he’s Venezuelan, because he had tattoos, and because he is Black.”She’s still haunted by the strange sense of finality in his last call. He had asked after his daughters, and whether his Isabella had been eating well. “I told him she had just had some plátano,” Jorgelis said. “And then he said to me: ‘I love you.’ He said to tell our mom to take care.”Araujo has struggled to explain to her daughters why their father hasn’t been calling them regularly. She lives in Mexico City with Carla, her six-year-old. Isabella, three, is in Venezuela with Jorgelis.Carla, especially, has started asking a lot of questions. “Recently, she said to me: ‘Mom, Dad hasn’t called me, Mom. Could it be that he no longer loves me?’” Araujo said. “So I had to tell her a little bit about what had happened.”Now Carla cries constantly, Araujo said. She misses her father, she misses his scrambled eggs, she misses watching him play soccer. She keeps asking if he is being treated well in detention, if he is eating well. “It’s too difficult,” Araujo said. “From a young age, kids learn that if you do something bad, you go to jail. And now she keeps asking how come her dad is in jail, he’s not a bad person. And I don’t know how to explain. I don’t know how to tell her there is no logical explanation.”Jerce had been in detention of some sort ever since he set foot inside the US.Last year, he had used the now defunct CBP One app to request an appointment with immigration officials at the border. After more than four months of waiting in Mexico, agents determined that he had a credible case for asylum – but decided to detain him in a maximum-security detention center in San Ysidro, California, while he awaited his hearing.“Jerce didn’t tell us much about what it was like there, because he didn’t want us to worry,” said Jorgelis. “The only thing he did say was, why did he have to be Black? I believe he faced a lot of racism there.”When he first arrived at the border, immigration officials had alleged he might be a gang member based on his tattoos and on social media posts in which he was making the hand gesture commonly used to signify “I love you” in sign language, or “rock and roll”.His lawyer, Linette Tobin, submitted evidence proving that he had no criminal record in Venezuela, and that his hand gesture was benign. She also obtained a declaration from his tattoo artists affirming that his ink was a tribute to the Spanish soccer team and not to a gang. Officials agreed to move him out of maximum security shortly thereafter, in the fall of last year. “I thought that was a tacit admission, an acknowledgement that he’s not a gang member,” Tobin said.When officials moved him to a detention center in Texas, Tobin worried that transfer would complicate his asylum proceedings. Since she is based in California, she wasn’t sure whether she’d be able to continue to represent him in Texas.Jerce had been worried when Tobin last spoke to him on the phone, in March, but she had reassured him that he still had a strong case for asylum. Now, the US government has petitioned to dismiss Jerce’s asylum case, she said, “on the basis that – would you believe it – he’s not here in the US”.“I mean, he’d love to be here if he could!” she said.Other than ensuring that his case remains open, Tobin said she’s not sure what more she can do for her client. After the ACLU sued Donald Trump over his unilateral use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged members from the US without legal process, the supreme court ruled that detainees subject to deportation must be given an opportunity to challenge their removals.But the highest court’s ruling leaves uncertain what people like Jerce, who are already stuck in Salvadorian prison, are supposed to do now. As that case moves forward, Tobin hopes the ACLU will be able to successfully challenge all the deportations.But in a separate case over the expulsion of Kilmar Ábrego García, whom the administration admitted was sent to Cecot in error, the supreme court asked the administration to facilitate Ábrego García’s return to the US – and the administration said it couldn’t, and wouldn’t.In his last calls with his family, Jerce told them he’d be out of detention soon – that it would all be better soon. Once he was granted asylum, he said, he would try to join a soccer league in the US and start earning some money. He had promised Carla he’d buy her a TV soon.Now, Araujo said: “I don’t even know if he is alive. We don’t know anything. The last thing we saw was a video of them, and after that video many speculations, but nothing is certain.”",

            "content": "India claimed to have thwarted retaliatory missile and drone strikes launched by Pakistan on Thursday evening, which attempted to hit sites in Indian-administered Kashmir, Punjab and Rajasthan.Residents in Jammu, in Indian-controlled Kashmir, reported missiles and drones over the city and the noise of explosions, amid a city-wide blackout.The Indian army said its air defence systems had intercepted eight missiles fired by Pakistan that had attempted to target military stations in Jammu and the wider Indian-administered Kashmir region.According to India, there were also attempts by Pakistan to target its Pathankot airbase in Punjab, which is less than 20 miles from the volatile shared border, and it came under heavy artillery fire from Pakistan forces. Locals living in the border cities of Jaisalmer and Bikaner also reported missiles flying overhead and the sound of shelling.A statement by the Indian army said it had “neutralised” all the threats from Pakistan with missiles and drones. “No losses,” it said.Thursday night’s attacks by Pakistan marked another escalation of the conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries, after Indian missile strikes on Pakistan in the early hours of Wednesday killed 31 people. Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, called India’s attacks, the most extensive airstrike attack on Pakistan in decades, an “act of war”.Earlier on Thursday, Pakistan had accused India of “yet another blatant military act of aggression” after it claimed at least 25 Indian drones had been sent deep into Pakistani territory on Wednesday night, killing two civilians and injuring four soldiers. Military and government figures made it clear that Pakistan saw the drone strikes as a further “provocation” and felt compelled to retaliate.India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, warned that India would respond to any retaliatory aggression by Pakistan. “If there are military attacks on us, there should be no doubt that it will be met with a very, very firm response,” he told a visiting foreign delegation.India’s claims to have stopped all Pakistani missiles and drone attacks are likely to come as a major embarrassment to Pakistan’s military. There was no immediate official comment from the Pakistani military but state-run Pakistan Television denied reports of military strikes in Indian-controlled Kashmir, calling them “false, baseless, and fabricated”.India’s initial strikes on Wednesday were a direct retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide. India had accused Pakistan of direct involvement in the attacks, through Islamist militant organisations it has long been accused of backing.India claimed Wednesday’s strikes targeted only “terrorist infrastructure” including training camps and homes belonging to well-known militant organisations that have been behind some of the worst terrorist attacks in India over the past two decades. It emphasised it had not hit any Pakistani military bases or equipment, and described the strikes as “measured, not escalatory, proportionate and responsible”.However, Pakistan denied that any terrorist groups had been operating in the areas hit by Indian missiles, and said the strikes had targeted only civilians.Throughout the day, the international community had made efforts to mediate between India and Pakistan and bring them back from the brink of all-out war. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he had spoken to Pakistan’s Sharif and India’s Jaishankar and urged “the need for immediate de-escalation”. The Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers flew into Delhi on Thursday.The two sides spent the day firing off escalatory allegations at each other. After Pakistan said India had “lost the plot” by sending dozens of drones into Pakistan, India alleged Pakistan had unsuccessfully attempted to launch drones and missiles at 15 military targets in its north and west, including in the cities of Amritsar, Srinagar and Chandigarh. It said its air defence systems stopped all the attacks.India’s defence ministry said it had “neutralised” the air defence system over the Pakistani city of Lahore and said: “Any attack on military targets in India will invite a suitable response.”Pakistan denied the allegations it had launched any strikes into India early on Thursday, with a military spokesperson referring to them as “phantom strikes”. Speaking to the Guardian, a senior Pakistani security official was clear that action would soon be taken. “The offensive response will come now,” he said.India’s border states of Rajasthan and Punjab were put on high alert for a reprisal attack by Pakistan, with all police leave cancelled and border security forces given shoot-on-sight orders for any suspicious activities.In Punjab, the Gurdaspur area was put under a complete blackout order on Thursday night while, in Rajasthan, schools near the border were shut, mock drills were conducted and evacuation plans were prepared. India said it had activated anti-drone systems near the border.Across both countries, flights were suspended and airports shut down. In Pakistan, all flights from Karachi, Lahore and Sialkot airports were suspended. More than 20 local airports across the north of India were closed until Saturday.In Pakistan’s Sindh region, which shares a border with India, a state of emergency was declared in all hospitals and health facilities, and all medical personnel and support staff leave was cancelled, according to a notice issued by the provincial health department.Tens of thousands of people living along the disputed border that divides the region of Kashmir continued to flee, as cross-border firing continued between India and Pakistan troops, leaving homes destroyed and civilians dead.Talib Hussain returned to his village of Salamabad, in Indian-administered Kashmir, on Thursday morning to find smoke still rising from the ruins of his two-storey house, destroyed by an artillery shell. His home was among several others levelled in the cross-border shelling between Indian and Pakistani troops in recent days.“I’ve lost everything,” Hussain said, staring at the devastation. “Nothing remains of my house. We live in constant fear of the next attack. We are completely helpless, with only God’s mercy to protect us.”",

            "content": "For most families, fallouts and squabbles are a regular occurrence. But what happens when those rifts deepen to an estrangement, such as appears to have beset the royal family and the Beckhams, and how can relationships be rebuilt?According to the following psychologists and psychotherapists, family reconciliation requires both sides taking accountability for their behaviour and not letting past grievances and trauma block efforts to meaningfully re-engage with estranged relatives.Where an adult child is estranged – as in the case of Prince Harry – parents and other relatives need to recognise whether the family narrative or culture is perpetuating this estrangement by portraying them as the troublesome rebel or outcast, say the experts.The behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings said the Duke of Sussex’s recent emotional interview with the BBC, in which he said there had been many disagreements with his family, some of whom would never forgive him, illustrated the importance of both sides accepting accountability for past behaviour.His comments about his family not liking him writing his autobiography, Spare, did not appear to recognise it revealed “really private family confidences”, she said. This risked undermining Harry’s goal to reconcile with his father, King Charles, and the rest of the royal family.Susie Masterson, a Bacp-registered psychotherapist in Stockport, said she encouraged estranged relatives to devise a verbal contract as to how they would like to engage with one another. This included the issues they were willing to talk about, and those that were off the table to begin with.Estranged adults also needed to separate past grievances and trauma from their present desire for reconciliation, she said, and expressed concern that Harry may not have done this.“I am not dismissing the hurt and the hardship,” said Masterson. “But if we want to move towards post-traumatic growth and we want to have family members in our lives, then we have to be able to reframe or at least compartmentalise that and move towards what we want to achieve or engage with together.”Georgina Sturmer, another Bacp-registered counsellor, said it could be counter-productive for one party to seek a show of good faith from the other side, as Harry appeared to do by asking the king to intervene in his personal security provision. “I would probably be exploring with them what is the personal cost of the current situation and what would it be like for things to be different?” she said. “It’s those conversations that sometimes make us think, can I consider letting my guard down?”Nicola Saunders, another counsellor, said where an adult child was estranged it was important for relatives to understand the family dynamics that may have pushed them out. Fear among other relatives of also being ostracised could exacerbate existing family divisions, she said, such as brothers or sisters rejecting a sibling already alienated from their parents.“The family culture [can] create this narrative of ‘Yeah, that person’s lying, they’re dramatic, none of what they say is true,’” said Sturmer. “It absolutely has a ripple effect. That’s common within a family – I’ll just keep my head down and I’ll reject my sibling because the last thing I want to be is be in their position.”Parents should also be mindful if high expectations of adult children led to feelings of disappointment and contributed to the relationship breakdown, said Hemmings.Experts said the partners of estranged family members could play an important role in rebuilding bridges if they are seen as neutral in the dispute. In the case of the royal family, the Duchess of Sussex has been blamed in the media for Harry’s estrangement, and similar complaints have been reported about Brooklyn Beckham’s wife, Nicola Peltz. In such cases, the estranged family member might choose their partner over their family, which hinders the reconciliation process, said Hemmings.“The estranged person needs to have a secure person alongside them to support them in a way that is helpful rather than destructive,” Saunders added. “Sometimes there can be a lot of collusion from the partner, especially if it’s within their interest for that estrangement to be in place.”The counsellor added that maintaining reconciliation involved developing a new kind of relationship between both parties. In the case of parent-child estrangement, this meant re-engaging as equal adults. “With respect, boundaries and trust, you have to treat them like bone china because if any of them are broken then the relationship falls down again.”",

            "content": "Noah from Los Angeles had listened carefully to the first words spoken by Pope Leo XIV from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica, but his lack of Italian meant he understood none of it.“Wait, you mean he’s American? Really? Wow, that’s exciting,” he said with some surprise on his way out of St Peter’s Square. As he absorbed the news of the first American pope, he said he hoped it would be good news for his country. “We sure as hell need it,” he said.Others said they knew little about Robert Prevost’s views or how his papacy might unfold. The new pope featured on few lists of papabile – cardinals considered to be in the running for the top job. His name was not among the favourites circulated by bookmakers William Hill six hours before the white smoke appeared above the Sistine Chapel.Maria from Ireland, possibly unaware of the new pope’s apparently liberal leanings, said she was disappointed and worried. “I fear this is the result of lobbying by hard-right American Catholics. It’s not what I was hoping for.”But Leo, another visitor from Ireland, said his papal namesake “looks impressive”. He added: “I think an American pope will help, especially the way things are in the world now.”When white smoke billowed out of the conclave chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel shortly after 6pm on Thursday signifying the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion members of the Catholic church, it was greeted by cheers, whoops, whistles and clapping from the thousands who had gathered in the square. At that point, no one knew who the new pope was, but it did not stop the chant of “viva papa” echoing around St Peter’s Square. Some people literally jumped with joy.The Catholic faithful and the curious tourists who had been waiting for most of the day began rushing towards the basilica, from where the pope would speak his first words within the hour. Nuns in habits and priests in cassocks moved with unexpected agility. Most had broad smiles, but some wept or held their palms together in prayer.Everyone wanted to be near the front for the pope’s first blessing. Phones were held aloft to capture the moment: white smoke against a perfect blue sky.Roads leading to St Peter’s Square began to fill with people who had heard the news on their phones, on the radio or on TV. There was a rush to reach the basilica in time for the pope’s first appearance.A lucky few got close enough to witness the colourful display of pageantry from Vatican bands and Swiss guards, resplendent in colourful uniforms; others crowded around the big screens.Way beyond the reach of the ecstatic crowds, Prevost was taken to the Room of Tears, adjacent to the Sistine Chapel, to choose his name, dress in his papal cassock and no doubt say his prayers.When he finally stepped on to the balcony to roars from the thousands packed into the square, he looked a little shellshocked at first, but soon his tentative smiles became broader.Unlike Francis, who spurned much of the trappings of the papacy from the day he was elected in 2013, Prevost wore a traditional red papal garment over his white cassock.A crowd of clergy and staff members at Chicago’s Catholic Theological Union erupted in a joyful cheer as Pope Leo walked on to the Vatican balcony, four decades after he graduated from the South Side school.Ashley and Chris Black, Catholics from Dallas, Texas, were in tears. They had come to Rome on holiday and had made their way to the square thinking “it would be amazing if we were here to witness a new pope being chosen”, said Ashley.“It has overcome me to be honest,” she added. “This is a once in a lifetime experience.”Lucas and Isadora had travelled from Brazil for a holiday, planned a year ago. “We had no idea we’d be here for the new pope,” said Lucas. “I am very happy.”Many were relieved that the decision had come quickly, on the fourth ballot of the cardinal electors, and less than 26 hours after the conclave began. A long conclave might have suggested that cardinals were unable to agree on the church’s future direction.Among the pressing matters facing the pope will be the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and South Sudan. Francis Pakduer, who comes from South Sudan, said he hoped the new pope would be a man of peace. “That is what I pray for more than anything,” he said.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/08/trump-fbi-investigation-letitia-james",
            "published_at": "2025-05-8 20:14",
            "content": "Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, after the Trump administration alleged last month in a referral that she may have falsified paperwork for properties she owns in Virginia and New York, according to people familiar with the matter.The investigation marks a swift and notable escalation against James, a major political enemy of Donald Trump, who was ordered to pay more than $450m in penalties as a result of a lawsuit brought by James’s office that accused him of inflating his net worth to secure financial benefits.In what appears to be the early stages of the FBI criminal investigation, prosecutors have impaneled a federal grand jury to hear evidence in the eastern district of Virginia after the head of the federal housing agency, William Pulte, last month made the referral to the justice department, the people said.The investigation appears to be multipronged, the people said, with involvement from the FBI in New York in addition to Virginia. The investigation appears to have gathered pace only in recent weeks with news of the grand jury filtering through Trump’s orbit in the last few days of April.The criminal referral rehashed claims touted online by Trump allies that James may have committed fraud by attesting in paperwork in 2023 that she would make a house in Norfolk, Virginia, which she was helping a relative to buy, as her principal residence while she was New York’s attorney general.Whether the allegations are substantial enough to result in criminal charges remains unclear. But its existence, which has not been previously reported, regardless raises the legal stakes for James in what appears to be the first criminal inquiry into one of Trump’s foremost political adversaries.James has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated retribution. In a letter to the justice department last month, James’s lawyer argued the residency claim was a mistake and that she had told the mortgage broker the house would not be her main residence.“Director Pulte cherry-picked an August 17, 2023 power of attorney that mistakenly stated the property to be Ms James’ principal residence,” James’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote. “The broker understood this, and that Ms James was not a Virginia resident.”Spokespeople for the justice department and the federal housing finance agency declined to comment.In a statement, Lowell criticized the investigations as baseless, adding: “This appears to be the political retribution President Trump threatened to exact that AG Bondi assured the Senate would not occur on her watch. If prosecutors are genuinely interested in the truth, we are prepared to meet false claims with facts.”Still, the allegations have gained traction in recent weeks among Trump’s allies, who appear to see an opportunity to try to invalidate Trump’s $450m civil fraud trial verdict by challenging James’s eligibility to be the attorney general, and to advance the possibility of criminal charges.The power of attorney was signed by James in August 2023, weeks before the start of the civil fraud trial. New York state law requires public officeholders to be a resident of the state and Trump’s allies have argued when the case went to trial in October 2024, James should have been ineligible to be the attorney general.Sign up to This Week in TrumplandA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationafter newsletter promotionTrump’s allies have also accused James of possibly obtaining improper financial benefits by attesting she would live in the Virginia house, therefore unlocking a lower interest rate for the mortgage because rates are lower for houses occupied by their owners.Real estate lawyers in Virginia suggested the paperwork was not likely to be an issue unless James had misrepresented her intentions with the house to a lender or insurer. James said in a separate loan application that she did not intend to live in Virginia.The criminal referral also accused James of buying a house in Brooklyn in 2001 that she characterized as a five-unit property with a loan that was only available for homes with four units, in order to receive better interest rates.The referral referenced a January 2001 certificate of occupancy that said the house had five units. In the letter back to the justice department, Lowell said the house had four floors, had been used by James as four units, and numerous other New York City records listed the building as four units.",

            "content": "What’s in a name? When it comes to a pope – everything. The white smoke from the Sistine Chapel earlier this evening told the world that a new pope to succeed Francis had been elected – and for the first time the pontiff is from the US.But if Donald Trump and his Catholic convert Veep, JD Vance, are ready to cheer, then they should think again. Cardinal Robert Prevost has chosen the name Leo XIV – and if you’re a papal Leo, you tend to be a reformer at the progressive end of Catholicism. That Prevost has decided to become Leo XIV will make Catholics think immediately of the last Leo – Leo XIII – and his 1891 encyclical or teaching document, Rerum Novarum, which outlined workers’ rights to a fair wage, safe working conditions and the rights of workers to belong to trade unions. If Pope Francis was the People’s Pope, then Leo XIV is all set to be the Workers’ Pope.The Catholic church in the US is deeply divided. On the one hand, there are those who supported Trump in the last election and adhere to Vance’s view that there is an order of love which puts family first, then your neighbourhood, and far after that, the rest of humanity. Then there are those who agree with Pope Francis that this is a misreading of Christianity – Leo XIV is likely to agree with his predecessor.For Prevost is an American with a difference: a cleric who has spent much of his life overseas. While born in Chicago, he joined the religious order the Augustinians, then became one of their missionaries in Peru and was later made a bishop there by Pope Francis. That experience will have given him an entirely different perspective on the Americas, and the US’s role in the world – an understanding of how Latin America can view its giant neighbour with suspicion, and how, for many Latin Americans, the church is about liberation, rather than toeing a rigid line of tradition.For cardinals in the conclave pondering who the next leader of the Catholic church should be, they will have considered leadership skills, pastoral experience, knowledge of the Vatican and toughness. Robert Prevost has all this in spades. He led his religious order as prior general, he has worked in a diocese, and since 2023 has been in charge of the Vatican department that chooses bishops. The view is that he has made having a compassionate or pastoral approach a priority for choosing who joins the episcopacy.There will be some who will worry that Prevost blotted his copybook when it came to dealing with abuse crises in Peru. The sexual abuse of children and vulnerable people remains a stain on the Catholic church, and how he handles it will be one of his great tests.While some LGBTQ+ organisations noted that, before Pope Francis was elected, Prevost expressed concerns about what he called “the homosexual lifestyle”, it is noticeable that one of the Catholic church’s leading advocates for gay people, the American Jesuit priest, James Martin, has described Prevost’s election as “a brilliant choice”, and said that Prevost is “kind, open and honest”.There will be other challenges too: tackling the issues that the cardinals raised in their pre-conclave meetings, known as the general congregations. The 12 meetings threw up the need for a continuation of Pope Francis’s ambitions for a church that gives lay people more say – known as synodality; that needs to continue to speak up for God’s creation at a time of environmental crisis; and that needs to continue to find a role for women in the church. Pope Francis appointed a few women to senior Vatican roles, but the dominance of men in the church was all too evident in the past couple of days, as the 133 male cardinal electors filed into the Sistine Chapel to vote for the leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.But if the cardinals were sure of one thing in their pre-conclave meetings, it was that the new pope must epitomise a pontifex – the old title for the pope meaning a bridge. In his words from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica, Leo XIV told the 40,000-strong crowd and the millions of Catholics watching around the world that: “We must be a church that builds bridges.” The new Pope only has to look to his native country of the US to see how damaging division can be – yet he will know how damaging division in the church is too. The Workers’ Pope must be a Unity Pope, too. Catherine Pepinster is a former editor of the Tablet",

            "content": "Three days ago, Donald Trump promised an announcement that would be very possibly the greatest announcement in the whole history of announcements. Come Thursday morning, he said the US and the UK had reached a full and comprehensive trade deal.I guess a lot depends on what you mean by the words “greatest announcement” and “full and comprehensive”. As details of the deal began to emerge, it rather looked as if the UK had managed to negotiate a worse deal with the US than we had even two months ago. One that was hardly transformative. Just reversing some of the damage that had been done to the UK by the US starting a global trade war. Tariffs as a protection racket.Still, a deal is a deal. These days, Keir Starmer has learned you get what you can get. And it’s more than any other country has got so far. It remains to be seen if others come out of the White House with anything better. But Keir wasn’t the only one who needed a quick result. Trump did, too. He had a reputation to maintain as a deal-maker and Americans were beginning to get twitchy that none had been reached. It wasn’t clear if this was a victory for crack negotiating teams, or a sign that both the US and the UK had been a bit desperate. So both sides were keen to chalk the deal up as a win for themselves.Then there was the choreography to think of. A televised phone call between the president and the prime minister, before each gave separate press conferences. In both instances it was Agent Orange to go first. Presumably, because no one was sure he could stick to the script. When you do a deal with The Donald, there’s no guarantee he isn’t going to change his mind before the ink is dry. It would be no surprise if he were to announce new tariffs by the weekend.Cut to the Oval Office where, 45 minutes later than planned, Trump was on the phone to Starmer. Bizarrely, he started by talking about rare-earth minerals, which weren’t part of the deal. He seemed to have forgotten what had been agreed with whom. His minders set him back on track and there were warm words about one of America’s greatest and most cherished allies. You wondered why he had previously treated the UK with indifference if he cared so much.“This is an historic day,” said Starmer. All the more so because it had happened on VE Day. Keir could almost believe he was Winston Churchill addressing a jubilant nation after six years of war. At this point, it looked as if Agent Orange might drop off.Trump’s powers of concentration aren’t all they might be and he finds it difficult when he’s not the centre of attention. Keir did his best to stop the president from flatlining by showering him with flattery. The Donald had been the best. Everyone and everything would be nothing without him.At this, Trump began to perk up. The US and the UK had been working for years on a trade deal. People had said it couldn’t be done, he boasted. And yet he had done it in a matter of weeks. Truly, he was incredible. He didn’t seem to realise that he hadn’t negotiated a full trade agreement. Just a small side hustle encompassing a few sectors. There was a ripple of applause from the sycophants in the Oval Office when Trump managed to press the right switch to disconnect the call.The Donald then invited his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnik, to expand a little on the deal. Howie is reportedly a billionaire but he also delivers a pitch-perfect impersonation of a halfwit. It’s hard to imagine him in a room negotiating the sale of a secondhand car. “This was the president’s deal,” he cooed. “If it had been left to me, it would have taken at least three years. He did everything. He is the closer.” Imagine. Howie had just told the entire world he had been out of his depth in a puddle. Truly, the world is fucked if he is one of its masters.Next up was the British ambassador, Peter Mandelson. Bowing deeply. Full of reverence. Mandy was born for days like these. When all that is required is oleaginous smooth-talking masquerading as sincerity. Truly, The Donald was nothing short of a genius. He wasn’t fit to wipe the president’s shoes. Trump had achieved more than anyone else in the history of the world. Thank you, thank you. We have reached the end of the beginning, he sobbed. Everyone was getting in on the Churchill act this VE Day. Trump nodded. Mandy was right about him.Back in the UK, Starmer was just starting his own press conference at the Jaguar Land Rover factory. Britain was open for business, he said. No less than the whole future of the UK had been saved. Keir, alone, had altered the course of history. Some men are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. Keir had managed all three. This was bigger than VE Day. Bring out the bunting. Drink the pubs dry. We were entering a new era of prosperity.This wasn’t just a victory for the UK. It was a victory for Starmer personally. Some people had said he should stand up to Agent Orange. Put the phone down. Don’t give in to bullies. But Keir had emerged triumphant. His brown-nosing had achieved the impossible. Which was, er … not quite as good as the deal we had not so long ago. It was time for the king to get out his silk pyjamas, line up the Diet Cokes and the Haribos and prepare for his sleepover with the president. If Keir had to suck it up, then so could Charles.",

            "content": "One would be forgiven for assuming there was a lot more to early summer slasher Clown in a Cornfield other than, well, a clown in a cornfield. Because ever since an inevitable premiere at SXSW in March, an impressively maintained buzz has followed – special drive-in screenings, an ambitiously wide release, the bullish positioning of a New Horror Icon – giving us enough naive hope that in an overcrowded genre (there’s estimated to be double the amount of wide release horrors this year compared to 2024), this one might be worthy of the hype.But the film, which was picked up by ever-growing horror streamer Shudder at the end of last year, would have been a wiser choice for a small screen premiere, a late-night weekend couch watch that feels a little too modest for the multiplex. The expansive rollout will likely have been triggered by the surprise success of last year’s Art the Clown sequel Terrifier 3, which made a staggering $90m worldwide from a $2m budget (it was released the month before Clown in a Cornfield was purchased). As small and junky as those films might be, they’re distinguished by a throughline of ghoulishly inventive ultra-gore, a throwback to the kind of video nasty violence that would worry and repulse parents, the act of seeing the films then carrying with it an air of juvenile rebellion.There’s nothing here to warrant such concern, no real sense of danger to be conjured, Clown in a Cornfield content to be a perfectly watchable, if mostly mechanical, production line slasher. “It’s like we’re in some awful 80s slasher horror movie!” one of the anonymous sub-Scream characters says at one point. Yes whatever your name is, it really is!It’s based on Adam Cesare’s YA novel from 2020, centered on a classic subgenre archetype – the smart dark-haired girl with a dead mum – as she moves to a new town with father (Hannibal’s Aaron Abrams). Quinn (Katie Douglas, giving young Cristin Milioti energy) is, of course, loathed to relocate from the big city of Philadelphia to the small town of Kettle Springs, a rural dead zone haunted by the reminder of what it once was, when its corn syrup factory brought employment and business to the townsfolk. But she soon finds herself a tribe – a group of rule-breaking YouTubing high schoolers – and a slowly evolving love triangle between a gruff kid from the wrong side of the tracks and the well-to-do son of the mayor.There is, however, a clown in a cornfield, ready to ruin her fun.The clown is named Frendo, a bastardisation of the town’s one-time mascot, this time far less friendly and far more carrying a chainsaw. It’s a character the teens have been using in their prank videos, faking attacks that have made them a target of the fatigued sheriff. But now, Frendo is real and he’s picking them off one by one, in and out of the cornfield.There are some appreciated tweaks to the formula here, attempts to update what could have easily just been an “80s slasher horror movie” but with smartphones. But they mostly come within a busy last act, a little too late, given how run-of-the-mill the majority of the film before that can be. The script, from Carter Blanchard and director Eli Craig, might have its roots in YA but the characters are as weakly etched and indistinguishable as they would be in any other old sleepover slasher. It’s only really in that final act when the we can see the source material, in a neat and genuinely surprising queer twist far more interesting and subversive than anything related to the cut-and-paste lead.The big reveal, while illogically daft, does have a certain on-paper thematic novelty to it but it’s cursedly both over-explained and hard-to-really-understand, a “why are you doing this?” response that rambles into nonsense. Perhaps the majority of Friday night teens aren’t going to Clown in a Cornfield for intricate plot specifics but even as a more base slasher, it just doesn’t have enough to make it remarkable. Frendo is just some clown, never given all that much to separate him from the many other horror clowns we know better, and while the deaths are certainly grisly, they’re interchangeable.There’s definitely a clown in that cornfield but there’s precious little else.Clown in a Cornfield is out in US and UK cinemas on 9 May",

            "content": "Andy Farrell has left the door open for his son Owen to join the ­British & Irish Lions tour of ­Australia and called on Henry Pollock to showcase his “cocky” streak after Northampton’s rising star was the standout ­selection in his squad.Farrell Jr was among the headline omissions from the 38-man group that will be captained by Maro Itoje, with Finn Russell, Fin Smith and ­Marcus Smith preferred as the fly-half options. ­Pollock’s selection caps a stunning rise for the 20-year-old who made his Test debut against Wales in March as part of a remarkable breakthrough season with Northampton. Marcus Smith benefits from his ability to play full-back despite falling down the England pecking order.The former England captain Jamie George, the Ireland fly-half Sam ­Prendergast and the in-form ­Toulouse flanker Jack Willis are among the other notable absentees from a squad ­featuring 12 Leinster players. ­Farrell revealed his final ­selection meeting with his assistants took six hours more than he expected.Farrell Sr was expected to name a 40-strong squad, but revealed he intentionally left “wiggle room” for players on their way back from ­injuries, including Owen. With the Lions facing a midweek match between the first and second Tests, the head coach is all the more likely to make additional call-ups, again raising the chances of Owen – who has struggled this season at Racing 92 – making the tour. For the equivalent match during the 2017 tour of New Zealand, Warren Gatland added a clutch of players who became known as the “Geography Six”.“He was in the conversation,” said Andy Farrell of his son. “An ­experienced player like that who is going for his fourth tour. You cover all bases, that’s for sure, with the leadership qualities and all of that.“We feel that Owen’s still trying to find his way a little bit back to ­fitness, like others. There are 38 picked, which leaves a couple of slots open for us during the track if and when needed. And Owen, like a few other guys as well, would be in that type of bracket.“We’ve left ourselves some ­wiggle room to be able to see how people ­progress because there are a few guys that are trying to play back into fitness and form, so we’ll see what we’ve got and if or when that’s needed, we’d like to call them.”Having turned 20 in January, ­Pollock will be the youngest player on the tour and, as is tradition, he will be responsible for looking after the Lions mascot.The squad was announced at a live event at the O2 in London front of around 2,000 spectators and ­Pollock’s inclusion was met by what was comfortably the loudest cheer. The Saints back-rower has attracted attention for his abundant talents – he has two tries from 31 minutes of Test rugby – as well as his unwavering self-belief and Farrell does not want Pollock to change his ways on tour.Backs B Aki (Connacht & Ireland), E Daly (Saracens & England), T Freeman (Northampton & England), J Gibson-Park (Leinster & Ireland), M Hansen (Connacht & Ireland), H Jones (Glasgow & Scotland), H Keenan (Leinster & Ireland), B Kinghorn (Stade Toulousain & Scotland), J Lowe (Leinster & Ireland), A Mitchell (Northampton & England), G Ringrose (Leinster & Ireland), F Russell (Bath & Scotland), F Smith (Northampton & England), M Smith (Harlequins & England), S Tuipulotu (Glagow & Scotland), D van der Merwe (Edinburgh & Scotland), T Williams (Gloucester & Wales).Forwards T Beirne (Munster & Ireland), O Chessum (Leicester & England), J Conan (Leinster & Ireland), L Cowan-Dickie (Sale & England), S Cummings (Glasgow & Scotland), T Curry (Sale & England), B Earl (Saracens & England), Z Fagerson (Glasgow & Scotland), T Furlong (Leinster & Ireland), E Genge (Bristol & England), M Itoje (Saracens & England, capt), R Kelleher (Leinster & Ireland), J McCarthy (Leinster & Ireland), J Morgan (Ospreys & Wales), H Pollock (Northampton & England), A Porter (Leinster & Ireland), J Ryan (Leinster & Ireland), P Schoeman (Edinburgh & Scotland), D Sheehan (Leinster & Ireland), W Stuart (Bath & England), J Van der Flier (Leinster & Ireland).“I’ve heard a lot of stuff that is constant about young kids that are coming through – he’s confident, he’s cocky,” said Farrell. “This is not just about Henry, this is about youngsters in general.“But what do we want? Do we want a kid to show his confidence as a 23-year-old, 24-year-old instead of 20? It’s just about the here and now, isn’t it? If he’s performing against the type of quality that he has been doing, then he’s ready. He’s ready to compete. I think you’ll see the fight in him. Everyone can see that anyway. I’m sure he’ll push all the others that didn’t realise that he was coming. I’m sure that he’ll relish that.Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotion“I’ve watched him a couple of times live and I like what I see. He’s always trying to make a difference. There’s an energy and bounce about him. That’s how you tend to have big moments in the game because you’re searching for them.”George’s omission was a surprise given he has found form since he was stripped of the England captaincy and would have provided valuable leadership to a squad that features 26 first-time Lions. The absence of Caelan Doris – struck down by a shoulder injury last Saturday – means Farrell is also without his Ireland ­captain and the head coach conceded the decision to leave George out was a difficult one. It is understood George was informed of his omission before the squad was announced.“As much as we are all delighted for the lads who are in, it’s tough to ­shatter people’s dreams, just for the time being,” said Farrell. “For Jamie and a few ­others they’ve got to stay with it, stay ­positive and stay strong, stay fit, because anything can happen.”Itoje, who said he was “deeply honoured and humbled” to have been named captain after taking a phone call from Farrell on Tuesday, said Pollock is “a young player who wants to make things happen”.The 30-year-old Saracens lock added: “I often find with these tours that the unexpected happens and there might be a player who had not necessarily come in with cult status but they have it by the end.”",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/08/trump-trade-deal-uk-analysis",
            "published_at": "2025-05-8 19:52",
            "content": "There was plenty of congratulatory backslapping in the Oval Office as Donald Trump unveiled his “major” trade deal with the United Kingdom on Thursday, but many of the details of that agreement have been left to later discussions.Trump’s rush to claim a win for his controversial tariffs policy left many grasping just what to call this: a deal, an agreement, a framework? Observers predict that the coming negotiations could take months.“Yes, we can finish ironing out some of the details, but there’s a fantastic platform here,” Keir Starmer said by speakerphone as Trump revealed the results to journalists on Thursday.Trade deals are usually announced only once those details are ironed out. But in this case, Trump appeared keen to get the deal out in public to make an announcement to the world: America is ready to negotiate.Thursday’s announcement was most notable for Trump reversing course on his “extreme tariff policies”, said Gary Hufbauer, a non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a non-partisan thinktank based in Washington. That could increase expectations for further deals with other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Australia or even the European Union.“The big payoff to Trump is the market reaction today in a more favorable political reaction in the US on his overall [tariff] policy,” said Hufbauer. “Here we’re getting this pre-announcement, which is all for political purposes, both in the UK and the US, with the hope and aspiration that the details won’t kill the deal.”Lord Mandelson, the newly minted British ambassador, felt moved to paraphrase Winston Churchill in the Oval Office on Thursday. He called the deal “not the end … It’s the end of the beginning.”“There is yet more we can do in reducing tariffs and trade barriers to open up our markets to each other even more than we are agreeing to do today,” he said.Journalists in the Oval Office were more direct. “Clearly, there’s much more work still to do,” said a US correspondent for Sky News. “With respect, are you overstating the reach and significance of this deal because you’re a president who needs a result at a difficult time?”If Trump felt some of the air come out of his big announcement, he didn’t show it.“It’s a great thing that it came together,” Trump said. “Because we have many countries want to make a deal, and many countries are very unhappy that we happened to choose this one to be honest with you.”The UK was perhaps “our oldest ally”, he added. “I think it’s going to be something very special for UK and special for the United States.”Trump added it had been an “honour” working with British negotiators on the deal.US stock markets reacted enthusiastically to news of the deal. But the announcement was mainly an “agreement to negotiate”, said Hufbauer, and those negotiations could hit thorny issues such as UK restrictions on US agricultural and meat exports, as well as Trump’s recently announced tariffs on foreign film shoots.“I think it’s unlikely Trump would want it to bust up, but the negotiations might go on for a while” if he pushes on sensitive issues, said Hufbauer.It appears there is the political will to move forward. During the Oval Office meeting, Mandelson said that Trump had called Keir Starmer in a “very typical, 11th-hour intervention”.And in perhaps the highest compliment that one can pay the US president, Mandelson added that Trump drove a hard bargain, demanding “even more out of this deal than any of us expected”.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/stockholm-rejects-us-letter-urging-city-to-reverse-diversity-initiatives",
            "published_at": "2025-05-8 19:49",
            "content": "A city official in Stockholm has said the municipality has no plans to comply after one of its offices received a letter seeking to impose Donald Trump’s rollback of diversity measures, in what is believed to be the first such missive sent to a foreign government.“It’s so bizarre,” said Jan Valeskog, Stockholm’s vice-mayor for planning. “It’s our political priorities that count, not the ones from this embassy or any other embassies.”In March, European officials lambasted the US after companies across the continent said they had received letters informing them that the Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives also applied to foreign firms looking to do business with the US government.The letter – described by French officials as “a form of interference” – asked recipients to complete, sign and return a form certifying that they “do not operate any programmes to promote diversity, equity and inclusion”.The letter added: “If you do not agree to sign this document, we would appreciate it if you could provide detailed reasons, which we will forward to our legal teams.”In Stockholm, Valeskog said he had received the letter on Tuesday. “We were really surprised, because diversity, equality and inclusion are values that we strive for and stand up for in Stockholm,” he said. “It’s very important for us.”He presumed the letter was sent to the planning office because it was listed as a payee, given that it charges for building permits. Still, it was the first time he had heard of one of these letters being directed at a municipality or foreign government. “It’s quite unique,” he said.After Valeskog spoke to the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter about the letter, emails and social media responses came pouring in from city residents and others across Sweden. “Thousands of people are really upset,” he said. “I guess most people are following the news about what is happening in the States. But suddenly it felt closer with these demands.”For months – despite research showing that companies with greater gender and ethnic diversity are more likely to significantly outperform their peers – Trump’s administration has opposed efforts to ensure that people of all backgrounds, including historically marginalised groups such as women and people of colour, can gain a foothold and thrive at organisations.Valeskog said Stockholm had no intention of complying. “Of course, we’ll not sign it, we won’t return it, we’ll do nothing about it,” he said. “So now it’s up to the embassy to decide what happens next.”The spate of US letters comes at a delicate moment for the transatlantic relationship, which has been left rattled by threats of escalating tariffs, security concerns and the Signal leaks that laid bare the Trump administration’s disdain for Europe.On Tuesday Valeskog called on the embassy, with whom they had traditionally had a good relationship, to withdraw the letter. Two days later, there had been no reaction. “They don’t have an ambassador, maybe that’s the reason – I don’t know,” he said.After describing the fallout over the letter as “their headache, not ours” earlier in the week, he again stressed that the US embassy stood to lose much more if it decided to break off its relationship with the municipality. “The embassy now and then needs our building permits, of course, so it’s in their interest to have a good contact and cooperation with the city of Stockholm,” he said. “And so this is really strange.”He said his office would continue to wait for some sort of response from the Americans. “I mean it’s quite big news, not only in Sweden but also in other countries,” he said. “So we’ll see what happens.”",

            "content": "More than 40 Labour MPs have warned the prime minister that planned disability cuts are “impossible to support” and have called for a pause and change in direction.The letter from parliamentarians spanning the new intake and veterans, and from the left and right of the party, sets Keir Starmer up for the biggest rebellion of his premiership when the House of Commons votes on the measures next month.There has already been widespread concern among Labour MPs about proposed changes including a significant tightening of eligibility for personal independent payments (Pips), saving about £5bn annually.They would also involve cuts or freezes to incapacity benefits for people who apply for universal credit but are judged unfit to work. According to internal Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) forecasts, the planned disability benefit cuts would affect 700,000 families who are already in poverty.A vote on the proposals is expected in June, and a number of MPs are concerned they are being asked to approve the plans without proper knowledge of the consequences.The letter has so far been signed by 42 Labour MPs, putting the government on course for its biggest rebellion yet.The proposals, set out in a government green paper, have “caused a huge amount of anxiety and concern among disabled people and their families”, according to the letter.“The planned cuts of more than £7bn represent the biggest attack on the welfare state since George Osborne ushered in the years of austerity and over 3 million of our poorest and most disadvantaged will be affected,” it says.“Whilst the government may have correctly diagnosed the problem of a broken benefits system and a lack of job opportunities for those who are able to work, they have come up with the wrong medicine. Cuts don’t create jobs, they just cause more hardship.”The letter calls on ministers to delay any decisions until they see full assessments on the impact of any cuts, and for “a genuine dialogue with disabled people’s organisations to redesign something that is less complex and offers greater support, alongside tackling the barriers that disabled people face when trying to find and maintain employment”.It goes on: “We also need to invest in creating job opportunities and ensure the law is robust enough to provide employment protections against discrimination. Without a change in direction, the green paper will be impossible to support.”Among the signatories are some MPs on the left of the party such as Diane Abbott and Kim Johnson, but also a series of more centrist backbenchers, and there are 14 from the 2024 intake, including Lorraine Beavers, Cat Eccles, Terry Jermy, Peter Lamb and Simon Opher.The benefit changes, set out by Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, in March, would tighten eligibility criteria for Pips so that people need to score four points in at least one activity to qualify for the daily living allowance.Also, while the basic rate of universal credit for those in, or looking for, work would rise by about £15 a week from April 2026, the incapacity benefit would be cut for new claimants judged as unfit for work. Support would be frozen for existing claimants.People under the age of 22 wanting the health top-up of universal credit would no longer qualify under plans being consulted on.Kendall said her department would spend up to £1bn a year extra on helping people back into jobs.When the plans were set out, Debbie Abrahams, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, warned against “balancing the books on the backs of sick and disabled people”.While a series of individual backbenchers have voiced their serious concerns about the plans, the letter makes plain the scale of that concern, even if the language of being unable to support the plans holds out the possibility of abstention as well as voting against.Starmer’s government has so far only experienced small Commons revolts, in part because of the very robust No 10 response the first time it happened.Downing Street suspended seven MPs from the Labour whip shortly after the general election in July when they voted in favour of a Scottish National party amendment to scrap the two-child benefit limit. A DWP source said: “At the heart of these reforms is a determination to help more people into work. We understand that there are concerns.“The secretary of state is engaging and talking to colleagues, explaining why these reforms will help transform people’s lives.”",

            "content": "British manufacturers have welcomed some tariff relief in the new US-UK trade deal, with the share prices of the sportscar brand Aston Martin Lagonda and jet engine maker Rolls-Royce rising.The US has agreed to cut tariffs on cars, jet engines and steel, although the 10% baseline levy will continue to apply to other products exported from the UK, the two governments announced on Thursday.Keir Starmer spoke to Donald Trump from the headquarters of JLR, the UK’s biggest automotive employer and one of the main exporters to the US.The US now has a quota of 100,000 British-made cars per year with a 10% tariff – significantly lower than the 27.5% rate Trump imposed in March, but more than the 2.5% before he took office. The UK exported about 102,000 cars to the US in 2024, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.Mike Hawes, the society’s chief executive, said the tariff cut on UK car exports was “great news for the industry and consumers”. He had previously said there would be job cuts “within weeks” at the luxury and premium carmakers that rely on wealthy American consumers.“The application of these tariffs was a severe and immediate threat to UK automotive exporters so this deal will provide much needed relief, allowing both the industry, and those that work in it, to approach the future more positively,” he said. However, he added that the UK should work on a deeper deal to cut trade barriers further.The deal also purported to remove a 25% tariff on British steel exports, which the leading body for the industry said would allow trade to resume. UK Steel’s director general, Gareth Stace, called the announcement a “major relief to the UK steel sector”. However, the group added there were still questions over whether steel derivative products would still be subject to tariffs.A senior steel industry executive said the deal was “clearly very positive”, despite some concerns over the details yet to be announced. The executive added that being the first to reach a deal would give the UK an advantage over rivals. Another source said they expected further “strings attached”, including restrictions on using Chinese material.Trump said Rolls-Royce engines, used on Boeing 787 passenger jets, would be exempted from tariffs. The share price of Rolls-Royce rose above £8 before dropping back to £7.94, a 3.7% increase for the day.Boeing’s share price also rose by 4% after the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told a press conference that an unnamed UK company would purchase Boeing planes worth $10bn (£7.5bn).Yet others were left empty-handed. The rest of the aerospace industry was left with little clarity on whether tariffs on aerospace parts would remain at 10%. One industry insider said there was “cautious optimism” that these tariffs would fall back to the 0% level in place before April. The White House said US companies would get “preferential access” to British parts.Whisky, which accounts for about 2% of UK goods exports to the US, will still attract 10% tariffs. A spokesperson for the Scotch Whisky Association said it still hoped for a “return to the zero-for-zero tariff agreement with our friends and partners in the US whiskey industry as soon as possible”.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionThe UK government also drew a rebuke from the beer industry, after appearing to suggest reducing tariffs on US ethanol would cut the cost of a pint because ethanol was “used to produce beer”.Ethanol is produced during the brewing process but is not among the ingredients used in beer-making. The Department for Business and Trade later removed the claim from a press release.A spokesperson for the British Beer and Pubs Association said: “We are urgently seeking clarity about the details of the deal as, given ethanol is not used to make beer, we cannot see how this is a win for brewers or pubs.”Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of Make UK, said the UK now needed to work on the comprehensive industrial strategy that business leaders have been calling for since Labour got elected.",

            "content": "Hang out the bunting and let the church bells ring. A VE Day trade deal with Donald Trump is done, and in the car plants of the West Midlands as much as in the backrooms of No 10, there will be understandable relief that, for now at least, America’s phoney war on them is over.It’s true that the easing of arbitrary tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium that didn’t even exist until eight weeks ago falls far short of being an actual trade deal, not least because the president could rip it up again tomorrow if he felt like it. But the terms agreed between London and Washington could save thousands of jobs, which isn’t to be sniffed at, even if they’re jobs that need never have been at risk in the first place had Trump not suddenly chosen to threaten them. More surprisingly, Rachel Reeves seems to have managed to hang on to her digital services tax on (mostly US) tech companies, while for all the president’s bluster about “dramatic” new access for cattle ranchers to British markets it could have been infinitely worse for British farming: no chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-injected beef or flooding of the market with heavily subsidised US meat at prices British farmers just couldn’t afford to match.No wonder Keir Starmer laid on the Churchill comparisons with a generous trowel, pointing out the deal was being unveiled on the same day at almost the same hour as Victory in Europe – or just Victory, as Trump calls it, as if the Europe bit was irrelevant – was declared 80 years ago. Once again, Starmer insisted, Britain and the US were “standing side by side”. Well, as side by side as it’s possible to be when one of you is in the Oval Office graciously removing your foot from the neck of the other one, who is listening anxiously in via video link while the new ambassador, Peter Mandelson, hovers oleaginously at the president’s shoulder. Trump volunteered in return that previous governments had long coveted a deal and “it never quite got there. It did with this prime minister.” If it all made you cringe, it’s hard to blame Starmer for that: or no more than you would normally blame a person with some unfortunate part of their anatomy clamped in a vice. But peace in our time? Not quite.This has been less a trade deal between allies – a process of give and take that in the long run hopefully leaves both sides better off – than a hostage negotiation. Pay Trump what he feels he’s due, and you get your economy back in roughly the state it was before, though missing a few fingers and probably traumatised. The 10% tariff on all British exports to the US, affecting everything from whisky to salmon as well as cars, stays with no word of when it might get lifted: that was “pretty well set”, Trump said, indicating that for him that particular conversation is done. The threat of a tariff on foreign-made films, which could crucify the British film industry, still hovers, alongside possible future tariffs on pharmaceuticals (though No 10 insists they now have some protection on that). But why wouldn’t Trump keep tariffing things? After all, as far as he’s concerned it works brilliantly.“We blew up the whole system,” Trump crowed, at one point. “Because of that, this worked out so nicely.” And if what he wants is a queue of publicly supplicant and privately seething world leaders at his door then he’s not wrong, though for Americans the price of satisfying his vanity may yet be an avoidable recession at home. Other countries, with bigger trade imbalances with the US and fewer options, may have to swallow worse than Britain.It will take time to unravel what this deal means for the May summit at which Britain is aiming for a bigger and more mutually beneficial “reset” deal with the EU, but getting something across the line now does at least mean the government doesn’t have both US and European plates spinning madly at once. (On which note, a period of silence would be welcome from fans of a hard Brexit that they were repeatedly told would leave Britain isolated and at the mercy of Washington or Beijing: it’s not this government, in Kemi Badenoch’s words, that “shafted” Britain on trade).While the deal potentially gives British firms exporting to the US a competitive edge over rivals based in countries still facing punitive tariffs, it doesn’t help companies selling into any market depressed by this trade war – which will be most of them, given the paralysing uncertainty caused by nobody in business quite knowing what he’s going to do next.The financial markets should rally, because Trump doing deals is at least better than Trump doling out arbitrary economic punishment: some will want to see in it a return to normal, after a burst of almost strategic craziness. But normal is a trade deal like the one Britain just did with India, a win-win exercise that doesn’t leave everyone around the table seemingly terrified of not being seen to laugh hard enough at the president’s jokes. If he finds the results of this first round of tariffs gratifying, then nothing about Trump suggests a man who knows when to stop.The most alarming thing about his mooted levy on foreign-made movies – breaking the convention that tariffs are normally charged on goods moving physically across borders, not services – isn’t the faintly bonkers suggestion that shooting the likes of the Barbie movie in Hertfordshire represents a “National Security threat” to the world’s foremost military superpower, but the sense of a president emboldened to push his trade war into new frontiers.Diplomats are trained not to pay ransom to hostage takers, no matter how heart-rending the pleas from captives’ families, for fear that if you give in they’ll come back for more. With Trump, that rule will be broken because it will have to be; democratic governments around the world, especially those besieged by populist parties, fear they won’t survive the consequences of telling an angry public that they’ll just have to learn to live with tariff-induced economic hardship following hot on the heels of crippling post-pandemic inflation. (Even Canada’s Mark Carney, having won his election on a explicitly anti-Trump platform, now faces the much harder task of leading Canadians through likely tough times ahead.)But if Trump’s economic aggression is rewarded, just as Putin’s territorial aggression is probably about to be rewarded in Ukraine, neither will be discouraged from trying it again. Eighty years on, we shouldn’t need reminding where that leads.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "Americans are celebrating and speaking out after the US cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who will be known as Pope Leo XIV, was announced as the next pope.“Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!” Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social shortly after the pope, who was born in Chicago, appeared on the Vatican balcony in Rome on Thursday.JD Vance, the US vice-president, congratulated the pope and said he was “sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!”The Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, said on X about Prevost’s appointment: “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago! Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon.”Illinois’s governor, JB Pritzker, called this pope’s appointment “a historic moment as we witness the first American leading the Catholic Church”.“Hailing from Chicago, Pope Leo XIV ushers in a new chapter that I join those in our state welcoming in at a time when we need compassion, unity, and peace,” he said.Meanwhile, at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Academy on Chicago’s North Side, screams of “Habemus papam!” echoed throughout the cafeteria.Seventh-grader Vincent Wall and eighth-grader Ava Broz were in the cafeteria where students were waving US and Chicago flags.“It really feels like a 2016 Cubs World series,” said Wall, referring to the North Side baseball team that endured a long drought before a triumphant victory in 2016. “It’s just, like, a pope from Chicago is just global and so is the World Series. It’s crazy.”Allison Foerster, who teaches Spanish and religion at the school, found out the pope’s identity while monitoring recess. Earlier this week, she had students take part in a mock conclave, with younger students playing cardinals.“For our students now, they’re connecting it back to what they saw on Tuesday,” Foerster said. “They immediately knew what part of the process it was. So they knew it was a moment of joy and a moment of celebration.”For Broz and Wall, they are also hoping Pope Leo make a visit to his home town.“I feel like we’ll have a connection because we know what Chicago is, like what they strive to do and what their understanding of life is, and I feel like he’ll incorporate that as pope,” Broz said.The president of Villanova University, where the new pope graduated in 1977, the Rev Peter M Donohue, said in a statement: “We celebrate this significant day for our University community and the global Church. Villanova, built on the teachings of St Augustine, has always been grounded in advancing a deeper understanding of the fundamental relationship between faith and reason – between spirituality and wisdom.“With today’s election of His Holiness, Pope Leo XIV, I cannot help but reflect on what his Augustinian papacy will mean to our University community and our world. Known for his humility, gentle spirit, prudence and warmth, Pope Leo XIV’s leadership offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to our educational mission.”Back on social media, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who is a conservative Catholic, said in a statement: “The United States looks forward to deepening our enduring relationship with the Holy See with the first American pontiff.”The US embassy to the Holy See also lauded the new pope on X: “With joy we extend our heartfelt congratulations to the first Pope from the United States of America.”The archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement on behalf of Archbishop Edward J Weisenburger to WXYZ, reading in part: “Pope Leo XIV’s election leaves me exceptionally joyful, and I must humbly acknowledge that I did not anticipate a United States citizen would be elected Pope. His lifetime of ministry includes many years of ministry as a bishop in Peru, giving him a thorough understanding of South America. Moreover, his close association with Pope Francis, history of charitable efforts for the poor and marginalized, extensive prior experience in the Vatican, and personal humility are all qualities that perhaps focused the light of Christ upon him for his brother Cardinals to see.”The official House Republicans account on X, which pointed out that the new pope is both “a native of Chicago, Illinois”, and the “first American Pope”, wrote: “May God bless you, and may He guide you.”Joaquin Castro, a Texas representative, called Pope Leo XIV “a Pope reflective of the late Pope Francis’ creed to be choose [sic] light over darkness, to be kind to our neighbor, and to work to uplift and unify all people in a divided world” on X.The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, posted on X: “The prayers of millions of Catholics around the globe are with you to guide the church forward and be a strong champion for compassion and dignity.”Around the world, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “Ukraine deeply values the Holy See’s consistent position in upholding international law, condemning the Russian Federation’s military aggression against Ukraine, and protecting the rights of innocent civilians” in a statement on X.“At this decisive moment for our country, we hope for the continued moral and spiritual support of the Vatican in Ukraine’s efforts to restore justice and achieve a lasting peace,” he continued.",

            "content": "Thursday’s trade agreement between the US and the UK fell far short of the superlatives heaped on it in Donald Trump’s excruciating televised phone call with Keir Starmer. But it is worth having, nevertheless.As Starmer made clear by appearing in front of an audience of Jaguar Land Rover workers in Solihull, reducing the 27.5% tariff on 100,000 car exports will come as a mighty relief for that industry.Steel and aluminium tariffs will also go completely, according to the UK side – though the fact sheet from the White House stopped short of saying that explicitly, instead saying a “new trading union” would be created in these two sectors.The 10% across-the-board tariff on all exports remains, but Trump appeared to suggest that will be the case for all countries – so UK goods will not be at any competitive disadvantage.In exchange, the concessions from the British side appeared relatively modest: opening up the market for US agricultural goods, including beef – though only, crucially, if it meets UK food standards – and slashing tariffs on imports of US ethanol. That should prevent Thursday’s agreement cutting across Labour’s hopes for a closer relationship with the EU.Given Trump’s fixation on Beijing, the US also appeared to have been reassured by the fact that the UK has taken control of the Scunthorpe steelworks from its Chinese owners.There was no cut in the digital services tax, which mainly hits US tech firms and had been widely touted as a potential offer to the White House. So the UK appears to have achieved its key negotiating aims with few big concessions. In other words, it is in a better position than last week.But zoom out, and it is clear that with 10% tariffs remaining on all exports to the US, the UK still faces significantly higher trade barriers than before Trump swept to power, determined to tear up the system. In effect, the president has stolen everyone’s lunch money – and is now exacting concessions in exchange for giving a portion of it back.While key UK sectors will be relieved, the wider economy is unlikely to experience much of a bounce. Coincidentally, the Bank of England published its quarterly growth forecasts on Thursday lunchtime, as it announced an interest rate cut to shore up the flagging economy.Sign up to First EditionOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersafter newsletter promotionThe Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, welcomed the prospect of a trade deal; its rate-setting monetary policy committee predicted that Trump’s trade policies would shave a fairly modest 0.3% off GDP over the next three years.Most of that, it expects, will result from the general slowdown in global growth as a result of the trade war and policy uncertainty, rather than from the direct tariffs on the UK. In other words, lifting tariffs for the UK, as Trump has now promised to do, is likely to have limited direct upside.The agreement may help to underpin the fragile economy, however, by alleviating some of the uncertainty identified by the Bank as a dampener on consumer and business confidence. It sends a wider signal to the US’s other key trading partners, too, that some of the madder aspects of Trump’s trade policy may be negotiable, if the right degree of flattery is applied.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 19:00",
            "content": "With a smell of rotting flesh the flowers of certain species of wild ginger are unlikely to be used in a wedding bouquet – although they are irresistible to carrion-loving flies. Now researchers say they have worked out how the sulphurous scent is produced.Scientists say the odour is down to small changes in an enzyme that prevents bad breath in humans.“Some organisms have an extraordinary trait which is seemingly difficult to evolve, but such characteristics can evolve in a simpler manner than one would imagine,” said Dr Yudai Okuyama, the first author of the research from the National Museum of Nature and Science in Japan.Writing in the journal Science, Okuyama and colleagues reported how they first investigated the origins of a key chemical known to be behind the sulfurous smell produced by some species of Asarum, or wild ginger.This chemical, called dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), is thought to be produced from a substance called methanethiol. Methanethiol is known to cause bad breath in humans and is formed in plants and animals as the amino acid methionine is broken down.The researchers confirmed this by feeding a form of methionine labelled with carbon-13 atoms to a species of wild ginger, A. fudsinoi, and found the DMDS released also contained carbon-13.The team then looked at an array of different species of Asarum to identify genes whose activity varied with the amount of DMDS produced.The work led to the identification of a gene that gives rise to a selenium-binding protein. Such proteins are found across the plant and animal kingdom, and typically convert methanethiol into less harmful substances. In humans this mechanism prevents halitosis.The researchers found the “normal” version of this gene was present in all of the plants and animals they considered, including the various species of Asarum. However, they found the latter also had a mutant form of the gene that produces a protein that turns methanethiol into DMDS. This mutant gene is more active in foul-smelling species.The team said the change in function appeared to be down to a small number of mutations in the gene, with only two or three changes in the amino acids of the protein needed for the shift to occur.Further work showed Eurya and Symplocarpus plants also have selenium-binding proteins that can turn methanethiol into DMDS, explaining why some species smell bad, with the team noting they appeared to have evolved independently.However, not all foul-smelling plants produce their scent in the same way: the team found species of Amorphophallus – a group that includes a plant known as the “corpse flower” – did not have a selenium-binding protein that converts methanethiol into DMDS.“We think some similar enzyme that belong[s] to a different protein family might be responsible for the step,” said Okuyama.",

            "content": "The Roman Catholic church has a new leader, the Chicago-born Robert Francis Prevost, now Pope Leo XIV. Once the prayers are over and the crowds have dispersed from St Peter’s Square, what issues must the new pope grapple with?A key task will be to strengthen unity within the church amid growing polarisation in the world and different views and expectations in the church. Some observers believe there is a real risk of schism after 20 years in which there have been popes on either end of the spectrum: the traditional/conservative Benedict XVI and the liberal/progressive Francis.Prevost is seen as a moderate. But will he be a unifying figure, reaching out to both traditionalists and progressives, and steering the church through the choppy waters of the 21st century? Or will he be identified with one wing of the church, thereby alienating another wing?A key area of unity and healing will be the American Catholic church, where Pope Francis was a divisive figure. Some US bishops are avid supporters of Donald Trump, while others are dismayed by the president’s policies and statements. An early visit to the US may be high on the new pope’s agenda.The pope has an important role to play on the international stage, particularly to ensure that religion does not become a faultline. He will face conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan plus the politically divisive issues of migration, the climate crisis, religious freedom and human rights.Christine Allen, the chief executive of the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (Cafod), has said the incoming pope  will be “one of only a few people in the world who can cross political divides and use his moral influence to help all of us look beyond our narrow self-interests and work together to overcome our collective challenges”.In common with other world leaders, Prevost will have to navigate Trump’s second term in the White House. Pope Francis openly rebuked the first and second Trump administrations on issues such as migration.The legacy of sexual abuse cast a long shadow over Francis’s papacy. He was slow to grasp the scale and systemic nature of the problem, and at first did not understand the pain and anger of survivors. That pain has not gone away, and the new pope’s approach will inevitably come under intense scrutiny.Protecting children and vulnerable adults, especially in places where the implementation of safeguarding procedures is challenging, is a key issue in the papal in-tray.Pope Leo XIV will need to take decisions on governance within the church, including the pace of change and levels of inclusion regarding laity and women. He will need to make key appointments within days to get the new papacy up and running.There has been a trend towards appointing qualified, professional laypeople to Vatican jobs rather than clerics. Under Francis, some key roles went to women for the first time, but some say the process of change could be quicker and more far-reaching.Sister Nathalie Becquart, who served as undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops for four years, said there was “no way to go back” but “a change of mindset and a change of culture” was still in progress. “The next step is to encourage the involvement of women at all levels of the church,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Sunday programme.There are two aspects to this for the new pope’s attention: general oversight and transparency, on which there was significant progress under Pope Francis but still more to do; and the unsustainable levels of deficit in the Vatican finances, which deteriorated during Francis’s papacy.In 2022, the Vatican budget accounts were about $94m (£70m) in the red, and the Vatican pension fund reportedly had a shortfall of more than $700m.One senior cardinal, Angelo Becciu, withdrew from the conclave because of convictions in 2022 of financial crimes (he is appealing). Francis had forced Becciu to quit his post after allegations of financial mismanagement came to light, but Becciu only withdrew from the conclave after being presented with letters written by Francis before he died saying Becciu should not take part in the process to elect the next pope.Francis shifted the church’s dial on issues relating to sexuality and identity, condemning discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, meeting trans men and women and authorising the blessings of same-sex couples.LGBTQ+ Catholics welcomed his compassion and affirmation while acknowledging he did not change church teaching. Francis’s standpoint prompted a backlash among traditionalists.He will also need to consider the issue of celibacy for priests. Francis ultimately ducked the issue of whether to allow married priests in parts of the world, such as the Amazon, where there is a dire shortage. Will the new pope push it through?",

            "content": "A West Point philosophy professor has announced his resignation after 13 years on the faculty, citing the academy’s rapid shift away from its core educational principles under the Trump administration in an essay for the New York Times.Graham Parsons, a professor of philosophy at the US Military Academy at West Point, criticized the institution for “failing to provide an adequate education for the cadets” under the new administration.“I cannot tolerate these changes, which prevent me from doing my job responsibly,” he wrote in the essay. “I am ashamed to be associated with the academy in its current form.”He goes on to say that West Point began censoring its curriculum to align with the administration’s ideological preferences following Donald Trump’s executive order and a memo from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. These directives prohibited instruction on so-called “un-American” theories, including gender ideology and any suggestion that “America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.”As a result, Parsons says West Point administrators began an aggressive overhaul of the curriculum. Faculty were pressured to revise or eliminate courses dealing with race, gender and power dynamics.Classes such as “Topics in Gender History”, “Race, Ethnicity, Nation,” and “Power and Difference” were removed. The sociology major as well as a Black history project at the history department were both discontinued.He added that influential authors such as James Baldwin, Toni Morrison and Alice Walker were removed from syllabi and a student debate team was instructed not to explore certain positions at a competition.Additionally, a new policy required professors to obtain departmental approval before publishing, speaking publicly, or posting on social media about their academic work. This shift, Parsons says, has made it impossible for many professors, including those studying subjects like masculinity and war, to continue their research without censorship.“West Point seems to believe that by submitting to the Trump administration, it can save itself in the long run,” he wrote. “But the damage cannot be undone.”Sign up to Headlines USGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningafter newsletter promotion“If the academy can’t convincingly invoke the values of free thought and political neutrality when they are needed most, it can’t accomplish its mission,” he added. “Whatever else happens, it will forever be known that when the test came, West Point failed.”The Trump administration has been at odds with US universities since he took office, with the president consistently threatening to cut federal funding to schools that don’t comply with his demands. Institutions of higher education have begun banding together in an effort to resist pressure from the administration.",

            "content": "British political debate around immigration has long been framed around three axiomatic beliefs: too many foreigners are coming, the explanation for that is incompetence by previous governments and the numbers can be brought down without economic cost.Those assumptions are sure to be expressed in a government white paper due to be published later this month. The document has been in preparation since well before the local elections last week, but the way it is presented by ministers and received by media will be shaped by the strong performance of Reform UK in that ballot. Anti-immigration sentiment is not the only driver of support for Nigel Farage’s party, but it is his totemic theme.Downing Street strategists hope to counter Mr Farage’s appeal with policies that signal attentiveness to public concern and promise more robust control over the nation’s borders. That could be expected to work if anti-immigration sentiment were simply correlated to statistical measures of net migration. The evidence suggests a more complex dynamic.While many voters dislike high immigration, such sentiment is not always strongest in places where immigrants settle. Multi-ethnic London is not a hotbed of Reform support. The proportion of foreign-born residents in Lincolnshire, which elected a Reform mayor last week, is lower than the UK average.Governments are pilloried when net migration figures go up, but rarely thanked when they come down again. For the year running up to last July’s general election, the number was 728,000, which was down from a record high of 906,000 in 2023. The Office for National Statistics expects a continued fall towards a plateau of about 315,000 by 2028. If public polling were index-linked to that data, concern about immigration (and support for Mr Farage) would be in decline. It isn’t.That doesn’t mean voter concerns are manufactured by media and cynical politicians. High net migration brings cultural and demographic change that many people find disorienting. In times of economic insecurity and constrained public finances, there is an inevitable risk that new arrivals in a society are seen as competitors for jobs, housing or other services.That suspicion is not automatically neutralised by enumeration of the contributions that migrants make to the economy and society. But when the positive case is never even made, or made only as a fleeting caveat in speeches pledging more draconian controls, it is hardly surprising that immigration is seen as a drain on national resources. The opposite is true. Without foreign-born nurses and doctors, there would be no prospect of cutting NHS waiting times. Without overseas students, UK universities would be in an even more severe financial crisis than they face already. The social care sector would barely function without imported labour.These facts are known to Labour ministers just as they were known to their Conservative predecessors, but none has found the courage to say them aloud. They imagine instead that there is some hypothetical net migration target that, if reached, would silence Reform.There is no such number. Mr Farage can always go lower because he feels no obligation to leaven his rhetoric with economic reality or care for social cohesion. The challenge for Labour, the only viable political strategy and the right course in principle, is to resist that race to the bottom and to call out the dangerous cynicism that drives it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "It is so ingrained in British culture to celebrate sunshine that unless you are a farmer or gardener, it is unusual to complain about the lack of rain. But alarms are being sounded by environmentalists and farmers after a very dry spring followed a winter during which parts of the country, including Northern Ireland, had only 70% of average rainfall.Some crops are already failing, and worse will follow unless more rain arrives soon. Conditions at the moment are said to resemble 2022 – the last time that farms suffered significant losses due to drought. In certain regions, fields have had to be irrigated months earlier than usual. The National Drought Group, which coordinates management of scarce water resources, met on Wednesday. Long-range forecasts are predicting more warm, sunny weather, but the UK’s weather is changeable. Two years ago the driest June on record was followed by an exceptionally wet July.While it is too soon to say for sure what the summer will bring, it is not too soon to start preparing. With the drought risk classified as medium, the Environment Agency is advising people to start limiting their water use. Water companies have also been asked to take action, and some have begun repairing reservoirs. Levels are particularly low in the north of England, where less rain fell over the winter. Depending on what happens in the next few weeks, summer hosepipe bans could become more likely.Worrying about drought and flood risks at the same time is probably still counterintuitive to many: too little and too much rain sound like opposite problems. But as the Climate Change Committee warned parliament last month, in its latest report on the UK’s progress in adapting to the climate crisis, the increased likelihood of extreme weather includes both.The watchdog’s sobering verdict was that, despite commitments in Labour’s manifesto, national resilience and preparedness have not improved. Some experts liken the water companies’ approach to “praying for rain”. Their failure to invest in new infrastructure, including reservoirs as well as sewage treatment plants, stands as an indictment of water privatisation. Higher drought risks, along with polluted waterways, are the price being paid for that political choice.Flood risks, meanwhile, keep rising as weather systems become less stable. Ministers must surely heed warnings against cutting flood defences, and learn from the disaster that followed torrential rains in Spain last October, when about 230 people were killed. It was, after all, in order to promote evidence-based climate policy and minimise the likelihood of shortsighted decisions, that the expert, non-partisan Climate Change Committee was set up.Along with threats to life, risks to agriculture must also be addressed. This was one area in which the committee’s adaptation report tentatively highlighted some positive changes, though it also warned that exceptionally poor arable harvests such as last year’s could become more common. While drought jeopardises spring planting, traditional winter crops are limited by heavy rain.Some farmers are already experimenting with alternatives; the UK has a growing number of vineyards and has seen its first chickpea harvest. Communication has always been a crucial aspect of the climate challenge. Right now, the risks posed by drought ought to bolster public support for net-zero policies, and encourage ministers to go further in the interests of food security.",

            "content": "A leading museum in the Netherlands has said it is reconsidering lending works from its collection to museums in the US amid the uncertainty wreaked by Donald Trump’s funding cuts and ideological impositions.Martine Gosselink, the director of the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, whose collection includes Vermeer’s Girl With a Pearl Earring and Rembrandt’s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp, said the turmoil had left her team wary of lending pieces to the US.She said the Mauritshuis had for years worked in tandem with art historians and curators across the Atlantic in a constant conversation involving loans of artwork and research collaborations.However, in recent months, as the Trump administration sought to cut funding and target exhibits it viewed as “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology”, politicians had started increasingly to creep into these conversations.US-based colleagues had expressed fears of losing their jobs or having to toe the government line, she said. “We really feel for our colleagues in American institutions about what’s happening in archives, libraries and museums,” said Gosselink. “It’s a huge catastrophe.”In March, Trump issued an executive order targeting the Smithsonian in Washington DC, accusing the world’s biggest museum, education and research complex of presenting “divisive narratives that distort our shared history”.His administration has also sought to cut funding to leading agencies that support US museums and other arts initiatives.Gosselink declined to name names but said plans had been in the works to lend pieces to specific institutions in the US.“I’m not saying we won’t do it,” she said. “But we will be extra careful and we need guarantees. Because if you lend it out to a museum and there’s not enough staff to treat it in the way you want [it] to be treated, then we wonder whether it’s a good thing to be sending our collection.”Earlier this month, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from further dismantling one of the agencies that provides funding to US libraries and museums in a move the American Alliance of Museums described as “the successful first step in what is expected to be a lengthy legal process”.But the threat of funding cuts continued to loom, with the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC coming under direct attack from the Trump administration.Sign up to Headlines EuropeA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayafter newsletter promotionThe uncertainty needed to be taken into account, said Gosselink. “How do you know for sure that the museum will still be open and working and operating during the whole period of the loan?”She said the Mauritshuis museum had not yet made any concrete decisions. “For us, it’s not a huge thing if a piece cannot travel for a couple of years,” she said.Instead, she lamented the far-reaching shock waves of funding cuts in the US.“But scientifically, you would like to discuss, to write books together, to do research together. I do wonder, of course, if these things will proceed in the way we did in the last decades,” she said.",

            "content": "My grandmother Eve Thompson, who has died aged 95, was variously a theatre stage manager, a secretary and a nursery nurse – until later in life she became involved in voluntary work and advocacy, particularly in relation to mental health.After Eve’s son Ben was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the early 1980s, she volunteered for the National Schizophrenia Fellowship (now Rethink Mental Illness), working with service users, carers and professionals to improve services, establish supported housing and ensure families received the help they needed.She became its national chair in 1990, a position she held for five years, and was also a trustee. Outspoken about funding shortfalls, in a 1993 article in the Independent newspaper she said: “The size of the cheque is the most important thing. You cannot make bricks without straw. There are simply not the cash resources available for what needs to be done.”Eve was born in Birmingham to Ernest Salt, a chartered accountant, and his wife Joan (nee Morgan). She attended Edgbaston high school for girls until, during the second world war, the family moved to Northamptonshire and then Stratford-upon-Avon, where she went to Leamington high school for girls. At 15 she joined the Birmingham repertory theatre school, and the following year travelled to Charleston, South Carolina, on a theatre scholarship.Later she worked as a stage manager for repertory theatre companies in Yorkshire and the south-west of England, until in 1950 she decided the theatrical life was not for her.Moving to London in the early 50s, she completed a course at St Godric’s secretarial college in Hampstead, north London, before taking on various secretarial jobs, including as secretary to the political cartoonist Vicky (Victor Weisz). After marrying John Thompson, a civil servant, in 1954, she concentrated on raising their young family – they had three children, Katy, Jenny and Ben.In the early 70s, despairing of finding a nursery place for Ben, who had additional needs, Eve trained to be a nursery nurse at Barnet College in north London, after which she worked for a number of years in a nursery for children with learning difficulties run by the Westminster Society. When she and John moved back to Stratford-upon-Avon in 1981 she retired.For many years Eve and John had been functioning alcoholics. Matters came to a head in the mid-80s when Eve was hospitalised and then treated at the Woodleigh Beeches alcohol and substance misuse unit, which she credited with saving her life.Afterwards both she and John remained sober for the rest of their lives. They also became active in Alcoholics Anonymous, supporting others in recovery with practical advice and compassion that drew on their own experiences.Known for her intelligence, dry wit and determination, Eve retained deep commitments to family and mental health advocacy, as well as a lasting love of the theatre.John died in 2007 and Ben died in 2016. Eve is survived by her two daughters, four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",

            "content": "By now, Djo is not a secret. The psychedelic electro-pop project led by Joe Keery, once an IYKYK solo bedroom-production artist, has reached the mainstream, making the festival circuit at Laneway, Coachella and Glastonbury. And Keery, an actor best known for playing foppish, helplessly winsome Steve Harrington on Stranger Things, has stepped out from the shadows of a persona initially meant to disguise his famous name; gone are the Scooby-Doo Shaggy-style wigs and costumes from Djo’s early performances, meant to dissociate any notion of the Upside Down from Keery’s longstanding interest in making music.It worked, though in a manner befitting a preternaturally charming and thoughtful celebrity who seemingly courts good fortune: by accident. Djo, pronounced like his first name, blew up not because he was “the guy from Stranger Things”, but because he inadvertently caught a rogue wave of virality. End of Beginning, a synth-y, nostalgic ode to a past version of oneself, became a TikTok track, a million videos soundtracked to Keery’s wistful “and when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it”, largely without knowledge of the name. The song racked up more than 1.4bn streams in 2024, two years after its release on Djo’s second album, Decide.Stranger Things may be gearing up for its final season, but the music is the show now. Keery made no mention of any of this context at the third of three sold-out shows at Brooklyn Steel for the Back on You tour, nor did he need to. As evidenced by the sheer amount of cheeky, anxiety-laced lyrics shouted back at him on Wednesday night, the crowd was here for a hit of Djo – modern dread, ennui and revelation in psych-rock form, fleshed out with a six-member band and clear rock-star ambition. “WHY TRYYYYYY”, Keery wailed in opener Runner, accompanied by a gunshot bass, one of many hooks on which the largely twentysomething crowd hung their inhibitions. (Another, off live standout Roddy: “There’s somethin’ wrong with this world / I feel it coming on / And contradictions take their toll / Is that where we went wrong?”)Keery is a clear student of the classics: Djo’s new album The Crux, released last month, is an irrepressibly catchy, if at times incoherent, genre mix that wears its inspirations on its sleeve, from Steely Dan to the Police, Fleetwood Mac to Tame Impala, Keery talk-singing with the shaggy world-weariness of Julian Casablancas. As a frontman, Keery channels each in a masterful performance of a rock star, guitar-slinging swagger and an ability to be funny just by bending “new yorkkkkk” into different shapes over and over. Keery has enough natural charisma to get away with giving little in stage banter; even bumbling the microphone came off as endearing (“New York! You made me drop my mic! I like it” is the most revealing the night got).The band clearly wants the music to speak for itself – and for the most part, it does. The electrified 1975-esque listicle in new single Basic Being Basic, as accompanied word-for-word by the crowd, elided any winking humor into an exorcism of boredom. Chateau (Feel Alright) blossomed from almost too-quiet meditation, finally showcasing Keery’s lovely singing voice, into full vibe-out drowning in guitar. In person, despite my ample cynicism over the TikTok-ification of music and the proliferation of phones at concerts, and Keery’s own wariness of a single snippet overtaking everything else, End of Beginning gave me goosebumps – a glittering three-minute hymn to the passage of time, the obvious choice for a finale wisely held four songs before it. (And with fewer phones than I expected, as if the crowd knew to heed his longstanding lack of interest in social media.)Some of Djo’s lo-fi, talky tracks translated to the crowded 70s studio-style stage – six band members, two drum kits, at least five keyboards and more guitars than I could count – better than others. A few that started out boppy, such as The Crux opener Lonesome Is a State of Mind, soaked up the full band into a punch of sound and swagger. Others, such as album standout Delete Ya, drowned out Keery’s voice, which flickered in the lower registers and at times buckled under the band’s weight. The show as a whole teetered a bit uneasily between full rock band energy and something vibier, more meditative and knowing. If Djo has a preferred direction, it seems to be the former, based on the 10-person finale with his opener, Post Animal, the Chicago psych-rock band with whom Keery used to play guitar; that song, Flash Mountain, burnt off all remaining hearing with a fireworks show of guitar shredding (complimentary).The torrent of pent-up musical energy felt earned – despite what people may assume to be a lark, Keery, his band and his former mates in Post Animal have been at this for a long, long time. “This is really special for us,” Keery said mid-show, referring to the New York venue and, perhaps inadvertently, the mutating nature of Djo – once a solo project, now an entity, still stealthily absorbing the fame.",

            "content": "Republicans in the House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation to codify Donald Trump’s policy of renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America”.The measure was sponsored by rightwing Georgia lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene and passed nearly along party lines, with all Democrats opposed and almost every Republican, with the exception of vulnerable Nebraska representative Don Bacon, voting in favor.Trump had announced in his inaugural speech that the US government would change how it refers to the body of water, which stretches from Florida to Texas and along the coast of Mexico. The bill would make the name change official for federal agencies, but it’s unlikely to attract the Democratic support needed to pass the Senate. Even if it did, other countries have no obligation to use the new name.Speaking on the House floor before the vote, Greene leveled unfounded allegations against Democrats and cast changing the name as a patriotic obligation.“The American people rose up in a historic election in November of 2024 and they told Washington DC they have had enough of the Democrat embrace and love affair of the cartels in Mexico. But Democrats today are fighting to keep the Gulf of America named the Gulf of Mexico because the cartels are their business partners,” said Greene.“You would think this would be the easiest vote that the United States House of Representatives could take, because, after all, everybody in here swore an oath to defend our constitution and to defend our laws and our land. Oh, but no, the Democrats can’t do it because we had four years of Democrat control where our borders were wide open and the American people are fed up with it.”Democrats countered that the legislation was a waste of time.“The truth is, this bill won’t fix a single problem. It does absolutely nothing to help the Gulf coast. It won’t create a single job. It’s not going to fix our climate crisis. It’s just dumb,” said Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House natural resources committee.Trump and his allies have pushed companies to use the new name for the gulf in the months since he took office. In February, it barred Associated Press journalists from the Oval Office, Air Force One and White House events in retaliation for the wire agency refusing to use the new term in its authoritative stylebook. A federal judge ordered the administration to restore the AP’s access in April.Sign up to Headlines USGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningafter newsletter promotionTrump has kept up his interest in changing the names of bodies of water globally.

            "content": "The UK and US have announced a new trade deal, or at least some elements of it, following a slightly chaotic transatlantic speaker phone call between Keir Starmer and Donald Trump.So what does it involve – and what was left out? Here is what we know and don’t know.With Starmer heading to the Jaguar Land Rover plant in the Midlands to herald the announcement, this was expected to be a major part of the deal, and it is.Tariffs for UK cars imported into the US will be cut from 27.5% to 10%, up to a maximum of 100,000 cars a year, close to total exports last year. This was, Starmer said, a “huge and important reduction” – even if it is capped, and still a tariff.US tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminium have been reduced to zero under the deal. This is relatively little in overall trade terms, comprising only about £700m a year.However, steel has a political resonance beyond its economic heft, with the UK government stepping in last month to take control of British Steel to prevent its Chinese owner shutting the Scunthorpe plant.The most potentially tricky area of the deal, not least due to concerns among UK voters – and farmers – about chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef.The result was hailed by Downing Street as “a win for both nations”. As ever, the devil could be in the detail. Government officials said there had been no compromise on food standards, while the deal would open exclusive access for UK beef farmers to the US.However, it also includes £5bn worth of agricultural exports from the US to the UK, with the US agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, saying the deal would “exponentially increase our beef exports” to the UK.The National Farmers Union cautiously welcomed the proposals, but said that UK arable farmers could have concerns about the inclusion of large amounts of bioethanol imports from the US.A White House guide to the deal which, while brief, gave more details than its Downing Street equivalent, listed a series of other, more specific agreements, including:“Streamlined” customs procedures for US imports to the UK.Preferential access to UK aerospace components for US manufacturers.Increased help for US firms with UK procurement.And now for areas where there was no news. Trump has been threatening tariffs on this, an important area of the UK economy, but it does not fall under the agreement – yet.Trump’s commerce secretary, speaking after his boss, indicated that more could come: “It lays out the plan that you can work with us in autos, you can work with us with aero and commercial. You can work with us in pharmaceuticals.”The UK film industry reacted with horror to Trump’s promise this week to impose a 100% tariff on all movies “produced in foreign lands”, with predictions it could wipe out a business worth billions of pounds to the UK economy.There was no carve out for this in the US-UK deal – but this is not a surprise. To begin with, Trump’s announcement was just days ago. Also, it was less a policy than a rant on social media, and it remains to be seen if it will be imposed, and if so, how.There had been speculation that Trump’s team would insist on concessions in one or both these areas as a price to reduce tariffs – which could have caused a big political storm.But answering questions in the Commons on the deal, Douglas Alexander, the trade minister, told MPs there had been no changes on either.",

            "content": "My brother, Martin Slavin, who has died aged 82, was a photographer whose images appeared in New Society, Time Out and the Guardian, among other publications.He joined the staff of Time Out in the early 1970s, combining photography with photo editing and picture research. Other roles managing the work of colleagues followed: in 1979 he became picture editor of the newly launched Now magazine and in 1981 he took on the role of managing editor of the Network Photographers’ co-operative agency.After four happy years there, he left “to take more pictures”, supporting his photography by writing for Ten.8 magazine and working as a freelance picture researcher for the Sunday Times, Marshall Cavendish publishers and the Listener. One visit to the Roseland Peninsula in Cornwall resulted in a stunning portfolio of images.Martin was born in Addlestone, Surrey, the second of the four children of Kathleen (nee Holohan), a Tefl teacher, and George Slavin, a veterinary scientist. After leaving St George’s grammar school, where he belonged to a “sort of” camera club, he arrived in 1961 to study electrical engineering at the University of Durham – and left in 1964 with a 2:2 in anthropology, having spent more time in the university’s darkroom than its library. He studied photography for a further year at the London College of Printing before launching his career.By the 1990s, Martin had begun to take an interest in garden design, which started with a few plants on the windy concrete balcony of his flat in London, then by word-of-mouth developed into a business. In the first decade of the new millennium he was designing gardens, picture researching, mentoring young photographers and film-makers and photographing the struggles of poorer Londoners to remain in their birthplace while redevelopment accelerated around them.He read widely on politics and society, and worked with other local activists to document and publish the 2012 Olympics site development on the Games Monitor website, plus photographing some of the comical quirks of the Games themselves. He developed an interest in abstract and fractal-based imagery, including an alluring “Blue Planet” graphic. He also produced a portfolio of photographs for the OrganicLea market gardens in Chingford.In 1977, Martin married Hazel Kaye. They divorced as good friends in 1989. Martin is survived by his siblings, Mike, Maura and me.",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/08/uk-interest-rates-cut-bank-of-england-uk-economy-trump-tariffs",
            "published_at": "2025-05-8 18:17",
            "content": "Bank of England policymakers have cut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25% to cushion the UK economy against the impact of rising economic uncertainty.The widely expected move from the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), its fourth cut since last August, also carried a warning that the UK economy would slow by a further 0.3% over the next three years in addition to dramatic cuts to its forecasts made earlier this year.In a blow to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the MPC said a combination of uncertainty surrounding the impact of US trade policy on the global economy and clouds hanging over the outlook for the UK meant growth would be almost stagnant for the rest of the year.Making its announcement ahead of a trade deal between Keir Starmer and Donald Trump, the Bank said economic growth “is judged to have slowed and is expected to remain subdued in the near term”.In a split vote, with two of the nine-member MPC voting for a bigger 0.5 percentage point cut and two voting to hold at the current 4.5% level, the Bank signalled a high degree of caution about the number of interest rate cuts over the rest of the year.Financial markets expect at least two further quarter-point cuts in borrowing costs this year.However, concern that inflation will persist above a 2% target into 2026 led the National Institute of Economic and Social Research to forecast this week that the Bank would be limited to just one more cut in 2025.The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, said: “Inflationary pressures have continued to ease so we have been able to cut rates again today. The past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be.“That’s why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts. Ensuring low and stable inflation is our top priority.”The Bank said its latest quarterly forecasts were based on the current tariff situation and did not take account of the proposed deal between government ministers and the White House, which was confirmed hours later.Details of the deal showed the UK had reduced a 27.5% charge on exports of cars and a 25% one on steel and aluminium, in exchange for concessions in some sectors including agriculture.However, the chancellor has made clear that regardless of any carve-out, the country will still be affected by the global slowdown expected to result from the trade war.Bailey said he welcomed the prospect of a deal, describing it as “good news all around, including for the UK economy”.He added that it was “excellent that the UK is leading the way”, before offering his congratulations to those involved on both sides.As well as monitoring the impact of trade policy, the Bank’s ratesetters said Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions, which came into force last month, would affect employment, wages and prices, though it remained unclear to what extent.MPC members were more concerned that a spike in inflation this year, largely due to higher council tax and utility bills, would provoke a disproportionate response from consumers already battered by a long period of rising prices.Inflation is expected to peak in the third quarter at an average 3.5%, down from previous forecasts of 3.7%, in part due to cheaper goods being redirected to the UK from China and other countries hit by US tariffs.Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotion“World export prices are expected to be materially weaker, particularly in China,” the Bank said, adding: “The current overall impact of trade developments on the UK is therefore likely to be disinflationary than inflationary.”Lower gas and oil prices would also lower inflation this year compared with a forecast in February, it said.Despite the lower peak in inflation, households could fear a more persistent rise in prices and focus their spending on essential items, limiting the amount of disposable income spent on big-ticket goods, depressing the economy further.Inflation is not expected to ease to the MPC’s 2% target until spring 2027.The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said projections by the Bank of lower economic growth and higher unemployment meant it should cut interest rates more aggressively.The TUC general secretary, Paul Nowak, said: “Lower borrowing costs will ease pressures on households, helping families with their weekly budgets and leaving them with more to spend. And it will make it more affordable for businesses to invest and grow.”The Bank’s outlook comes after a run of downbeat data on the UK economy, with surveys suggesting consumer and business confidence is weakening.The Bank said the result would be “subdued” growth in business investment, which is likely to put a brake on hoped-for increases in the UK’s productivity.Goldman Sachs said the Bank was much more reticent to cut rates than expected. The investment bank had predicted an 8:1 split on the MPC in favour of rates cuts and a signal of several more to support the ailing economy.",

            "content": "Bernie Sanders is partnering with the group Run for Something to help support a new generation of progressive candidates interested in seeking public office.Questions about the future of Sanders’ leftwing movement have followed his cross-country Fighting Oligarchy tour, where at each stop the Vermont senator encourages supporters to get involved and run for office. The initiative builds on those calls, Politico first reported, by teaming up with organizations that recruit and train candidates running for office, with an emphasis on young people.“I am writing to ask you to run for office. Yes, you,” Sanders wrote last month in an email to supporters, which included a link to a form that promised to connect interested parties with an organization that would provide information and training on running for office. “We need to elect progressives at every level in this country who are prepared to side with the working class in America and fight for an economy and government that works for all of us, not just the few.”More than 5,000 people have already expressed interested through Sanders’ operation and have been connected to one of the partner organizations, including Run for Something, the group said.“Young people aren’t waiting for the change we need – they’re stepping up to be that change,” Amanda Litman, the president of Run for Something, said in a statement announcing the partnership. “Our future depends on building a new generation of leaders, and with this partnership, we can reach even more young people ready to serve their communities and fight for change.”Run for Something, founded in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s first election victory, helps recruit and support young progressive candidates interested in running for down-ballot races. The group said it has had more than 45,000 candidates sign up since election day – more than it had in its entire first three years.Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, has rankled some in the party for suggesting some left-leaning candidates would fare better if they ran as an independent. The Democratic party’s brand is deeply tarnished in Republican-led corners of the country, and its overall approval rating has fallen to record lows since Kamala Harris lost the presidency to Trump.Post-election, many centrist Democrats blamed the progressive wing, led by Sanders and House members such as representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Maxwell Frost of Florida, for pulling the party too far left over the past decade. But Sanders argues the opposite, that his populist economic agenda, pieces of which Trump also supports, is crucial to winning back working-class voters.With the Democratic base desperate for leaders willing to take on Trump, the senator, joined along the way by Ocasio-Cortez and Frost, as well as representatives Ro Khanna of California and Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, has drawn the biggest crowds of his life during his tour. Though the 83-year-old has not formally ruled out a third bid for the White House, his tour and the new effort to recruit candidates is seen as an attempt to guide the movement he has built over decades toward a post-Sanders future.",

            "content": "The owner of British Gas has suffered a shareholder rebellion after handing its chief executive a multimillion pound pay packet while energy bill payers struggle with record levels of debt.Nearly 40% of Centrica’s shareholders voted against the board’s pay plans at the energy company’s annual investor meeting in Manchester on Thursday, after rising criticism of boss Chris O’Shea’s pay during the energy crisis.O’Shea’s basic salary rose 29% last year to £1.1m to take his total pay packet, including bonuses and share-related pay, to £4.3m for the year.The payday was about half what he was paid the year before when his pay packet ballooned to around £8m, largely thanks to a £5.9m bonus scheme.The pay rises have angered consumer groups, fuel poverty campaigners and climate activists who have accused the company of profiting from higher energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine while millions of households have struggled to pay their heating bills because of soaring energy costs.In total, household energy debt and arrears have climbed to about £3.8bn, an increase of around £2bn since the start of 2022.Centrica’s market value has grown by over 250% in the last five years due to climbing energy market prices after the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, shares in the FTSE 100 company fell by 7.5% on Thursday after it warned that the mild start to spring would dent its profits for the first quarter.Ahead of the shareholder vote, leading proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended against supporting O’Shea’s pay packet at the annual meeting.ISS told its clients the pay rise was “materially above those given to the wider workforce” and “not considered to be supported by cogent rationale”.Mel Evans, Greenpeace UK’s climate team leader, called on the government to cap pay rises and bonuses for energy companies so they are not “rewarded for deepening the cost of living crisis”.“You know the profiteering has gone too far when even the shareholders start rejecting the bumper pay rises put forward by greedy bosses,” Evans said. “We’re all sick to death of being unfairly ripped off by the gas industry, who have made eye-watering profits at the expense of ordinary billpayers in recent years.”O’Shea said last year that it was “impossible to justify” his pay when British Gas customers were struggling. “You can’t justify a salary of that size,” he told the BBC. “It’s a huge amount of money; I am incredibly fortunate. I don’t set my own pay; that’s set by our remuneration committee.”Sign up to Business TodayGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningafter newsletter promotionA spokesperson for Centrica said: “While we welcome the backing of the majority of our shareholders for that resolution following extensive engagement on remuneration, we will continue to engage with shareholders in constructive and open dialogue.“The company will provide an update to shareholders within six months of today’s meeting.”Separately, Tesco’s annual report revealed that the pay of its chief executive, Ken Murphy, fell by about £1m to £9.23m – still 373 times that of the average employee at the supermarket group – after he missed targets on his bonus-related sales and profits as well as food waste.The retailer was forced to revise down its success in tackling food waste after a problem with a partner – which it emerged was turning the waste into energy rather than feeding it to animals as agreed. This year Murphy could earn more than £10m if he hits all his targets as his basic salary has been increased by 2% to almost £1.5m.",

            "content": "When the scores are tied, there is 50 seconds left on the clock and you need someone who is going to step up and take that drop goal, then Andy Farrell was your man. And when the series is all square with one game left to play and you need someone to give the big speech that is exactly what everyone needs to hear in the last hours before the match, you will not find many better. He may very well turn out to be exactly who you need to lead a group of the 38 best players from Britain and Ireland through a six-week tour of Australia, too.Whether any of this means Farrell is someone you want to pay to see play the O2 Arena is another matter. But here he was under the bright lights regardless, sandwiched between Usher and Olly Murs in the (un)coveted Thursday 3pm slot at the Indigo Lounge, front and centre of the British & Irish Lions’ first live squad announcement show.“So what makes the Lions so special, Andy?” asked the presenter, Lee McKenzie. “Well,” Farrell replied under his breath, “it’s impossible to put into words.” After four years of waiting, the final 30 minutes started to feel painfully long.Rugby is not very good at razzmatazz. Three months back, Formula One made a runaway success of using this same venue for its season launch, but then, with the best will in the world, they were offering the attenders a little more than the chance to listen to the Ireland scrum coach, John Fogarty, make small talk with Ugo Monye or offer a round of applause to Gavin Hastings, who was sitting in a box somewhere up in the gods. At one point, McKenzie asked Monye what he remembered about the day, in 2009, he found out he had been selected.“The hardest thing about it was waiting, so shall we just get on with it?” Monye said, which got a loud round of applause. He always did have a good eye for an opening.Not that it is such a bad idea to turn the British & Irish Lions squad announcement into a live event. The squad selection is, after all, the most distinctive thing about the team, their USP, as the corporate sorts who run the sport say. It is that the Lions had decided they needed to charge people to come along and watch it that felt all wrong. Tickets went on sale for £60, were then reduced to £35 and, in the very end, were being given away first come, first served. Even then, there were plenty of empty seats. No one I spoke to who had paid for their place had been offered a refund.Whatever the Lions are supposed to be about (and there was, as there always is, an awful lot of talk about their values) it is not money. It surely would have been a better idea to give the tickets to players, coaches and administrators who volunteer to help run clubs or people who missed out on going to the 2021 tour to South Africa at the last minute because of the travel restrictions during the pandemic. Or even to distribute them to the rugby-playing schools in the neighbourhood instead of using it as an opportunity to gouge an extra few thousand pounds out of the fans.The few hundred who had made their way along looked a little lost inside the shopping mall that surrounds the venue. Most decided, in the tradition of these things, that, in doubt, the best thing to do was get along to the bar for a couple of jars and there was a rush on in the All Bar One in the lobby.Sign up to The BreakdownThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedafter newsletter promotionThey were all wearing red Lions jerseys of one vintage or another and swapping stories about the tours they had been on together. People love this team and, given what they pay to follow them, they deserve better than being charged 50 quid to provide room meat for a live stream of a squad-naming.There was even a man out in the crowd telling everyone when it was time to clap. When Maro Itoje walked in they did not need any prompting, but got to their feet and started whooping and hollering. A couple of burly, bald blokes at the back started celebrating as if they had just won the call-up themselves. Because there is, still, a beautiful idea at the heart of all this. The Lions are unlike anything else in all sport, you just wish it was not getting harder and harder to find it, buried there somewhere underneath all the nonsense.",

            "content": "The Trump administration is invoking the “state secrets privilege ” in an apparent attempt to avoid answering a judge’s questions about its erroneous deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García to El Salvador.US district judge Paula Xinis disclosed the government’s position in a two-page order on Wednesday. She set a Monday deadline for attorneys to file briefs on the issue and how it could affect Ábrego García’s case. Xinis also scheduled a 16 May hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland, to address the matter.The Republican administration previously invoked the same legal authority to cut off a judge’s inquiry into whether it defied an order to turn around planes deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.Ábrego García, 29, has been imprisoned in his native El Salvador for nearly two months. His mistaken deportation has become a flash point for Donald Trump’s immigration policies and his increasing friction with the US courts.Trump has said he could call El Salvador’s president and have Ábrego García, who was living in Maryland, returned to the United States. Instead, Trump has doubled down on his claims that Ábrego García is a member of the MS-13 gang.Police in Maryland had identified Ábrego García as an MS-13 gang member in 2019 based off his tattoos, Chicago Bulls hoodie and the word of a criminal informant. But Ábrego García was never charged. His lawyers say the informant claimed Ábrego García was in an MS-13 chapter in New York, where Ábrego García has never lived.The administration has balked at telling Xinis what, if anything, it has done to facilitate Ábrego García’s return to the US. The judge ruled that his lawyers can question several Trump administration officials under oath about the government’s response to her orders.In a court filing on Wednesday, his lawyers said they already have conducted depositions of three officials and are “still in the dark” about the government’s efforts to free Ábrego García. They are asking for permission to depose more officials, possibly including one from the White House.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 17:49",
            "content": "Sue Bird is giving another assist to USA Basketball, becoming the managing director of the women’s national team.The five-time Olympic champion was named to the newly created position Thursday and it marks a major change in the way the organization creates its roster and coaching staff.“I played for USA Basketball for so long and always really enjoyed my time with them,” Bird said. “I love representing my country. I love being competitive on that stage. To have that opportunity to do it in a different role is exciting.”Before the change, a committee made those decisions, but now in a move similar to what the USA men’s national team does, Bird will be the one responsible for putting things together. Grant Hill has the same role on the men’s side.“We are really, really excited about Sue for so many reasons,” USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley said in a phone interview. “Her pedigree and standing in the sport is so strong. Not just in women’s basketball, but all of sport. She’s a tremendous leader and we’re very excited that she took this on for us.”The men’s team has had a managing director for two decades with Jerry Colangelo serving in that spot from 2005-21 before Hill took over.“She’s had five Olympic gold medals herself and understands what’s involved,” Tooley said. “Having the managing director position makes it easier to work with the staff for long term vision of the program. It’s hard to do that with a committee that comes and goes and gets together a handful of times.”Tooley said Bird’s term will be for four years – the same as the Olympic cycle – and the change to this structure has been in the works for a few years, well before the decision to not select Caitlin Clark for the 2024 Paris Games team that left some people upset.“Discussions happened after the ‘21 Olympics and Sue served on the board last quad,” Tooley said. “We got in discussions about the managing director role and we sat with her awhile and she gave it a lot of consideration and thought. It’s an enormous responsibility.”Bird said she’s used to the pressure of USA Basketball where it’s basically win a gold medal or bust. The Americans have won eight straight, including one at last year’s Paris Olympics.“This is a different type of pressure,” she said. “I’m hoping to bring all that I learned as a player, all my experience, all my understanding. The whole goal is to win a gold medal and it feels at times that’s the only option. ... I know what it’s like to be a player, know what it’s like as a player to build teams and have teams come together and see what clicks.”Before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Americans will play in the Fiba World Cup in Germany next year. The first qualifying event will take place in November. Besides figuring out what players will be on that team, Bird will have to decide who will be coaching the squad. There is no clear-cut choice right now.“Of course I’ve started to think about it, jotting some names down here and there,” Bird said. “It’s the first priority without a doubt. There are so many qualified coaches in college and the WNBA.”Bird said that she doesn’t have a specific time frame to have a coach in place.",

            "content": "My father, Chris Gathercole, who has died aged 87, was a pioneering clinical psychologist. He was an advocate for people with learning disabilities being involved in decisions about themselves and for them to be independent.He worked at large hospitals in Glasgow, Liverpool, North Wales and Lancashire, where he introduced innovative American concepts such as “social role valorisation”. The idea behind it was to improve the lives of those with disabilities, emphasising the importance of people having a place in society, their wellbeing and making sure they had and access to the “good things of life”, such as relationships and employment.Chris was senior psychologist at Bryn-y-Neuadd hospital, Llanfairfechan, in the 1970s. The harpist Elinor Bennett (Lady Wigley), whose sons came under his care, recalled: “He was a very kind, caring and hard-working member of the team who helped our family with the care and education of our two disabled sons, Alun and Geraint. He worked to raise the quality of life and to establish more compassionate care and access to education for disabled children and their families within the community.”Born in Smethwick, West Midlands, Chris was raised in Sheffield, and attended the naval training school HMS Conway on Anglesey. His father, Ernest, was a head teacher, and a Methodist lay preacher, and his mother, Frances (nee Reading), a Labour party activist and Sheffield city councillor. They instilled in him a belief in public service.After graduating from University College London with a degree in psychology, and completing a diploma in clinical psychology at Glasgow University, Chris went on to work for the NHS for the next 38 years, after being inspired by a lecture by Aneurin Bevan. In 1966, his book, Assessment in Clinical Psychology, was published by Penguin.Chris retired in 1996, but continued to contribute to the community near his home in Whalley, Lancashire, starting a local Freecycle group, helping set up Transition Town Clitheroe and spearheading Ribble Valley Against Racism.Farouk Hussain, of Clitheroe mosque, said: “Chris was a principled and passionate human whom we, the Muslim community, were proud to have as our friend. He showed immense bravery, standing up to lead the fight against the British National party.”He was a founder member of Whalley Hydro Scheme, creating green energy for the local community, and was instrumental in establishing a community forest garden.Chris met Dorrie Gordon at dancing lessons at HMS Conway, and they were married in 1958, going on to have two daughters, Gill and me, while living in Glasgow.In 2019, they returned to North Wales, where they planted a wildflower meadow and small woodland, and Chris was active in the climate action movement, Gwyrdd Ni, in the Llanberis area. Despite accomplishing so much, he resolutely avoided the limelight, citing his belief in the importance of collective action.Chris is survived by Dorrie, Gill and me, and his older brother John.",

            "published_at": "2025-05-8 17:45",
            "content": "Colin Berry, who has died aged 79 after suffering from dementia, was a disc jockey and newsreader whose calm, chatty style was heard on BBC Radio 2 for almost 40 years. He presented late-night and early-morning shows, and then filled the 2am to 5am gap between them as a regular host of You and the Night and the Music when the station started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 1979.“It’s certainly for insomniacs, but not only for them,” he said on Ray Moore’s late show, moments before the inaugural edition went out, with Berry as its first presenter. “There are drivers, there are people working through the night.”He added that the format included short features such as a nationwide “what’s on” guide and a cookery slot for “those of our listeners who get home late at night and feel like a snack”. Moore retorted: “If you think I’m going to go home and start frying eggs at 4 o’clock in the morning, you’ve got another think coming.”Through-the-night programming proved a success and, after the show’s run ended five years later, several others replaced it.You and the Night and the Music’s launch made Radio 2 Britain’s first round-the-clock national radio station. At the same time it became totally independent of Radio 1, finally ending a system where some programmes were shared.From 1981, Berry also started regularly hosting his second stint on what the BBC termed the “early show”, which followed You and the Night and the Music and preceded Terry Wogan’s breakfast programme.His Radio 2 career was a merry-go-round of presenting during the “graveyard” hours (Night Ride, 1973-75 and 1989-95, Music Through Midnight, 1975, and the early show, 1975-77 and 1981-88).In an era when the station’s output was dominated by easy-listening music, his soothing tones chimed with the style.Berry was also a newsreader, and eventually the longest-serving one on the station (1973-2012). His was the first voice on Radio 2 to announce the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.But his face was recognised – by television viewers in dozens of countries – only after he became the BBC’s presenter reading out the British panel’s votes in the Eurovision Song Contest, a job that lasted from 1977 to 2002. “Television Centre, London, calling – here we have the results of the United Kingdom jury,” were his typical opening words. He missed just two years – with Moore taking over duties in 1980 and Ken Bruce in 1998.His responsibility was actually greater than just revealing the choices of the jurors to up to 600 million viewers from the basement of the BBC. He was also on standby to take over from Wogan as the commentator in the event of technical problems, although he was never called on to step in.Berry was born at Brocket Hall, a stately home near Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire – which the City of London hospital had been using as a maternity unit since the second world war – to Nellie (nee Young) and Cecil Berry, a director of Allied Suppliers, which bought goods for the Home and Colonial Stores grocer’s chain.His fascination for radio began as a child growing up in Kenton, Middlesex. Berry would tape records from BBC Light Programme shows and add his own links, with his parents listening on a speaker in another room.On leaving Wembley grammar school, he landed a job in the London offices of the ITV company Granada Television as a studio technician responsible for slotting commercials into the breaks between programmes.He moved on to selling advertising airtime at Westward Television, and then the pirate station Radio Caroline (1965-67), where he additionally organised records and tapes to be taken to its ship off the Essex coast. He had a stint as a newsreader there – under the name Robin Berry, because it already had a disc jockey called Colin Nicol – but gave it up after suffering from sea sickness.A brief job followed selling advertising at Yorkshire Television’s London office in 1968 and he was a DJ in London, Essex and Sussex clubs, as well as becoming a record plugger, a summer relief announcer for HTV in 1971 and presenter of his own Saturday afternoon show on BBC Radio Medway (1972-73).In 1973, he joined Radios 1 and 2 to write and present programme trailers, and he soon became a Radio 2 announcer, newsreader and DJ.Berry’s other shows on the station included European Pop Jury (1978-83), with presenters introducing new songs from their own countries and a panel of young people from each nation voting for the best at the end, Eurovision Song Contest-style.He later returned to BBC local radio with regular shows featuring a strong dose of nostalgia on Three Counties Radio, broadcasting to Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire, from 2008 to 2019.In 1981, Berry married Sandra Barker. She and their daughter, Marina, and son, Jonathan, survive him. Colin Derrick Berry, broadcaster, born 29 January 1946; died 16 April 2025",

            "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/mystery-brain-illness-canada-new-brunswick",
            "published_at": "2025-05-8 17:44",
            "content": "A new peer-reviewed scientific study has found no evidence of a mystery brain disease in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, suggesting instead a troubling combination of “misdiagnosis and misinformation”.The research comes as the Maritime province prepares its own assessment of more than 220 suspected cases in the hope of giving families some answers to a medical mystery that has gripped the region for years.The report published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, known as Jama, is an independent reassessment of 25 cases diagnosed by Moncton-based neurologist Alier Marrero from within the broader sample of 222 patients.The authors, affiliated with the University of Toronto, New Brunswick’s Horizon health network and other Canadian institutions, found that those within the cohort were misdiagnosed and had common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury and metastatic cancer.The findings, however, are unlikely to tamp down speculation from families that the report once again ignores their suspicions of environmental contamination in the region.Health officials in New Brunswick first warned in 2021 that more than 40 residents were suffering from a possible unknown neurological syndrome, with symptoms similar to those of the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.Those cases were referred to Marrero after the initial physicians were initially stumped by the symptoms displayed by their parents. A year later, however, an independent oversight committee created by the province determined that the group of patients had most likely been misdiagnosed and were suffering from known illnesses such as cancer and dementia.A final report from the committee, which concluded there was no “cluster” of people suffering from an unknown brain syndrome, signalled the end of the province’s investigation.But earlier that year, the Guardian reported that a top federal scientist worried there was “something real going on” in New Brunswick. Another said the investigation “was shut down” and that caseloads were higher than officially acknowledged. “I don’t think it is helpful to suggest or point to who or why – suffice to say that we were prepared to marshal both financial and human scientific resources to tackle the mystery, but they were declined,” the scientist wrote.According to a February 2025 letter Marrero wrote to federal and provincial officials, seen by the Guardian, the number of patients suffering from unexplained neurological symptoms has since jumped to 507 across New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. Several are under the age of 45.The new study found that “well-known conditions were identified in all 25 cases, including common neurodegenerative diseases, functional neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury and metastatic cancer”, adding that a study of 11 autopsy cases led to the conclusion that “a new disease was extremely unlikely, with a probability less than .001”.Patient advocacy groups have rejected the idea of a new “mystery illness”, instead arguing that the cases are linked by environmental contaminants. But the researchers say they do not believe the patients were made ill by exposure to something in the environment, such as herbicides or heavy metals like mercury.They determined that “misdiagnosis and misinformation become inextricably entwined and amplify harm exponentially”, noting that more than half of the people eligible for the study declined to participate.They also blamed “inaccurate clinical assessments and an over-reliance on ancillary testing” for perpetuating the idea of a “mystery illness” and said they found “meaningful discrepancies” in case histories.Marrero said in a statement he is “in profound disagreement with the study conclusions” and has “many questions regarding the methods and the content”, adding that he was “appalled” that an investigation with a “small number” of patients has been conducted without his knowledge.Susan Holt, the province’s premier, pledged a fresh and “thorough” investigation after taking office last last year.“I think we need to be doing everything we can to shed some light on this and find a way to stop what’s making people sick,” she said at the time.New Brunswick’s chief medical officer of health, Dr Yves Léger, said in a statement the Jama study doesn’t change his office’s intention to complete its own investigation into the 222 cases, which Marrero has officially referred to the province.Updates will be posted on the province’s new website, and a public report with recommendations is expected in the coming months.",

            "content": "Los Angeles will make Olympic history in 2028 by staging the opening ceremony of the Summer Games across two venues: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. LA28 organizers confirmed the unprecedented dual-venue format on Thursday, making Los Angeles the first city to open an Olympics at two stadiums simultaneously.The 14 July ceremony will also mark a milestone for the Coliseum, which organizers say will become the first venue to host Olympic events at three separate Games, following 1932 and 1984. SoFi Stadium, the $5bn home of the NFL’s Rams and Chargers which opened in 2020, will make its Olympic debut.The Olympic closing ceremony will be held on 30 July at the Coliseum, the longtime home of the University of Southern California football team. The Paralympic Games will open at SoFi Stadium on 15 August and close at the Coliseum on 27 August, the final event of LA’s first time hosting the Paralympics.“The venues selected for the 2028 opening and closing ceremonies will highlight Los Angeles’s rich sporting history and cutting-edge future, showcasing the very best that LA has to offer on the world stage,” LA28 chair Casey Wasserman said in a statement. “These two extraordinary venues will create an unforgettable experience, welcoming fans from across the globe to an Olympic and Paralympic Games like never before and concluding what will go down as one of the most incredible Games in history.”City officials praised the announcement. “The Coliseum has long stood as a beacon of sports history,” Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass said. “To welcome the world to it once again is a tribute to our city’s lasting place on the global sporting stage.”Stan Kroenke, the sports team owner whose portfolio includes Arsenal and the Los Angeles Rams, said the SoFi Stadium was built to host events of this magnitude. “The LA28 Games fulfill that dream in the most powerful way possible,” he said.The LA28 programme includes 351 medal events – 22 more than Paris 2024 – and several additions, including flag football, cricket and squash. New mixed-gender events in gymnastics, athletics and table tennis are also on the slate.Last month LA28 unveiled additional venue plans for the Games, including Dodger Stadium for baseball, Trestles Beach in San Clemente for surfing, beach volleyball in Long Beach and squash on the Universal Studios lot as it makes its Olympic debut.While Paris 2024 drew praise for its opening ceremony along the River Seine, LA28 is expected to embrace Hollywood-style storytelling and local culture across its ceremonies. Full details are still under development, although an open call from LA28 in Feburary inviting live production companies to express interest in producing the ceremonies indicates that the selection process for the creative leadership is underway.“We’re not just hosting another Olympics. We’re making history, again,” said Carol Folt, president of the University of Southern California, which oversees the Coliseum.The Games will run from 14 to 30 July, followed by the Paralympics from 15 to 27 August. The full list of medal events can be seen here.",
